        "description": "Digga D has been sentenced to three years and 11 months in jail for supplying 45kg of cannabis. The popular UKhip-hopstar (real name Rhys Herbert) was arrested on February 21st last year while live-streaming on Instagram.\nIn May, he pleaded guilty to two charges surrounding the importation and supply of cannabis. However, Digga denied his involvement in the commercial sale of up to 60kg of cannabis at Lincoln Crown Court, but his pleas weren’t accepted.\nAccording to theBBC, Judge Simon Hirst said in December that he was “satisfied” that Digga had played a significant role in supplying cannabis and had sold at least 45kg for commercial profit.\n“It is agreed you had a significant role on the basis you expected significant financial advantage,” he said. “On occasions others were involved in the operation of returning and collecting cannabis. The level of the offending is so serious that there must be a sentence of imprisonment.”\nDigga took to Instagram this morning to share a photo of his mugshot while thanking fans for their support during his time behind bars. “We all make mistakes but remember God has a plan for all of us,” he wrote. “I appreciate everyone who has taken the time to write to me.”\nJames Scobie KC, who was defending Digga, said, “He does not have a team, this is very much a one-man band. The defendant has been away now since February of last year. There is a very much positive side, legitimate side, to this young man’s life in respect of his work which is that of a performer and a writer to some degree of international notoriety and following.”\nHe added, “It is very, very sad and disappointing that he has had at the very least a year of his productive working life behind bars. He’s not a danger to the public, he’s actually a contributor to the public.”\nDigga released an explicit new single called ‘Okra & Fiji‘ on January 31st. He raps on the song, “I don’t like boujee bitches/ I want a bitch that will suck dick now/ If you’re selling it, what’s the amount?/ What’s the sort code? Send the account.”\nA post shared by Digga D (@digga)",

        "title": "Dr Dre reveals reason why Drake crossed line in Kendrick Lamar beef",
        "description": "Drake was involved in a bitter feud with Kendrick Lamar last year involving scathing diss tracks. However, there was one moment in particular whenDr Drebelieved Drizzy had crossed the line.\nDuring an episode of the new Audible seriesThe Unusual Suspectswith Kenya Barris and Malcolm Gladwell, Dre touched on the beef and claimed that Drake took it too far by mentioning Kendrick’s wife and kids.\n“I love that record,” he said about the ‘Not Like Us‘ diss track. “I’ma say this on camera. I don’t want to get negative. My whole shit is about being positive and moving forward and all that shit, but the fact that I heard Drake say something negative about Kendrick’s wife and his kids, that made me say, ‘Ah, adios!’”\nDrake made allegations about Kendrick abusing his wife, Whitney Alford, and claimed that Dave Free, K.Dot’s longtime friend and pgLang business partner, was the father of one of his kids. He took shots about the topics across songs such as ‘Push Ups’, ‘Family Matters’ and ‘The Heart Part 6’.\nKendrick explained the meaning behind ‘Not Like Us’ during a conversation with SZA forHarper’s Bazaarin October. “This man has morals, he has values, he believes in something, he stands on something. He’s not pandering,” he said about the song’s character.\n“He’s a man who can recognise his mistakes and not be afraid to share the mistakes and can dig deep down into fear-based ideologies or experiences to be able to express them without feeling like he’s less of a man. If I’m thinking of ‘Not Like Us’, I’m thinking of me and whoever identifies with that.”\nDrake actually wrote for Dre when he was 19, as told in the 2016 bookThe Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory. “It was some of the most strenuous militant shit I’ve ever done,” he said. “But no useable songs came out of it. When I think of how he worked us, it’s no wonder he didn’t get anything out of it. It was just writers in a room churning out product all day long.”",

        "title": "Kanye West has helped Jim Jones get sober for the first time in 30 years",
        "description": "Former Diplomats rapperJim Joneshas revealed that he reached sobriety after three decades. However, he also shared that this is partially due to Kanye West. The Dipset emcee has recently been in Japan with West, and the two former Roc-a-Fella artists were seemingly working on music and fashion.\nJones recently took to Instagram to reveal that he hasn’t smoked weed or drunk alcohol for several consecutive days and admitted that this is a feat he hasn’t achieved since the 1990s. Talking to his followers, Jones explained, “I ain’t smoked in five days. I’ve been around here bouncing like a kid, like I’m in high school. I definitely got that high school feeling.” During the video, itwas apparent theOn My Way to Churchcreator was walking in Tokyo.\nDetailing how he felt, the ‘Baby Girl’ rhymer told his fans, “My body ain’t feel this pure in a minute! I was in the club dancing last night for like 45 minutes straight, sweating.” He wrote in the caption, “I ain’t been sober in 33 years this sh!t feel gooood can’t lie.”\nHe continued, “But I need that HT soon I a land lol I’m addicted lol but at least I know when it’s time for business I’m disciplined to stop cold Turkey for Whats important Japan is n was a vibe till next time arigato.”\nIt has also been suggested that, while living in Tokyo, Japan’s highly stringent drug laws may have played a part as you can receive sentences for mere possession of marijuana. It has been extremely surprising to see Jones alongside West in recent times as the former hasn’t been at the forefront of music for years. However, it seems he may be playinga part in the creation ofBully.\nThe ‘Christmas In Harlem’ collaborators were seen hanging out together earlier this month at Tokyo nightclubs, listening to music and looking over clothes. Jones also hinted that he was contributing to Ye’s new album.\nAlongside a photo of him next to Ye, the ‘We Fly High’ hitmaker wrote on social media, “We out here playin’ BULLY BALL only shot u don’t make is the shot u don’t take. This is about believing in urself when no one else will. “I’m a student and A teacher this past 5 days, I was the student I learned so much about character. Never judge unless u wearing a black robe.”\nJones then bigged up Ye’s forthcoming project by adding,“Bullythis album so crazyI wouldn’t drop if I was y’all or drop now cause when he drops this is gone b a big problem. We not takin’ no for answers we are theBULLY. Safe to say @ye back, aka THE REAL BILLY GOAT pun intended.”\nA post shared by jimjonescapo (@jimjonescapo)",

        "description": "Will Smithhas announced that his new album,Based on a True Story, will be released in March. It will be his first in 20 years following 2005’sLost and Found, which featured hit singles ‘Switch’ and ‘Party Starter’.\nTo coincide with the news, Smith has also released his new single, ‘Beautiful Scars‘, collaborating with Big Sean and OBanga over production from Omarr and LaXoskeleton.\nTaking things back to his roots, Smith raps in the first verse, “Fly as a eagle, fresh outta Philly/ Yeah, I still rep the city/ Mirrors on the wall worth half a billi’/ ‘Cause I’m a icon/ Somebody you could base your life on/ That you should place your sights on/ Shot on Canons and Nikons/ Turn the cameras and lights on.”\nAlthough the tracklist forBased on a True Storyis currently unknown, Smith released a single called ‘Work of Art’ with Russ and his son, Jaden, in July last year. Before that, he dropped ‘You Can Make It’ with Fridayy and the Sunday Service Choir, along with ‘Light Em Up’ alongside Sean Paul for theBad Boys: Ride or Diesoundtrack.\nSpeaking toBFA Collectivein July, Smith revealed he was working on a “powerful” new album that he believed was his most personal to date. “Over the past year and a half, I’ve been in the studio,” he said. “I have a project that is the most personal and powerful music project I’ve ever done. The idea of the music is, ‘Dance in your darkest moments.’”\nSmith discussed the material even more in September, detailing a gospel sound and the honesty in the music. “The last couple of years have been a real soul-searching experience for me,” he toldGet Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell. “I had to move past my superhero persona and dig into something more authentic … It’s about the parts of me where I’m scared or confused. It’s from a place of real honesty.”\nHe continued, “I don’t see it as just making a gospel record. It’s more about what feels true to me and what can help others. I grew up in the church, and that background influences everything I do. My grandmother played Mahalia Jackson every day. Performing in the church choir was my first real experience with music.”",

        "description": "Pop starRihannawas recently seen at A$AP Rocky’s trial on January 30th, where she sat in the gallery. The ‘Diamonds’ vocalist turned up for her husband on the second day of his official trial for the assault of his former friend A$AP Relli.\nRihanna reportedly sat between A$AP Rocky’s sister and mother throughout the trial and watched on as a judge began proceedings.Rocky is facing two felony chargesfor assault with a semiautomatic firearm after he allegedly fired a gun at Relli in 2021.\nOn January 30th, A$AP Relli was cross-examined by Rocky’s lawyer and, according to reports, at one point, began shouting attheLive.Love.A$APcreator. As such, a recess was called so that the prosecution’s lawyer could calm him down and give him instructions on how to conduct himself during the examination.\nDuring the trial, Relli allegedly shouted at A$AP Rocky, “You did this to yourself!” The judge was forced to respond sharply, telling the former rapper, “Do not talk to the defendant!” Reports emphasise that throughout proceedings, it was painfully clear that Relli was frustrated by the questions Rocky’s attorney asked.\nA$AP Rocky’s lawyers produced screenshots during the trial of Relli’s Instagram after his testimony to prove he did not have a positive relationship with the emcee prior to their altercation. This put Relli’s stories into question.\nIt was alleged that before the 2021 incident, he had been so alienated by his former crew that his business endeavours had failed, and he had no social media presence at all, thereby, there was no evidence that he was friendly with Rocky in any capacity.\nRelli is not only suing A$AP Rocky for the alleged 2021 assault with a firearm but is also suing his defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, for libel following various public statements he made about Relli. Rocky’s legal team have been attempting to highlight that A$AP Relli is merely trying to get money from their client and has insisted the prosecution’s account of what happened has changed over time.\nIn various statements since pressing charges, Relli has told the public that although details of his story may have shifted over the past three years, his fading memory doesn’t change what fundamentally happened. At the beginning of the trial, Relli persisted, asserting,  “A gun was pulled on me. It was pointed at me, and it was fired later.”\nRelli has recalled the night in front of the jury detailing that he and Rocky had a fight in a Hollywood street and has insisted that it escalated to a point where his former friend took out a gun and pointed it at him. According to Relli, Rocky as he walked after him, pulled the gun again and then held it in the air.\nThe judge in the case ruled on Thursday morning that Relli’s social media posts capturing what seems like a luxury lifestyle after the incident would be fair game for questioning. If it made him as distraught as he has detailed previously.",

        "description": "Sean ‘Diddy‘ Combs has been accused of coercing two other women into sex acts and dangling a woman over a balcony in an updated list of charges filed by federal prosecutors. According to documents filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan on January 30th, the new allegations are part of a superseding indictment.\nAn anti-sex-trafficking law known as the Mann Act is mentioned in the filing, prohibiting the transportation of people for prostitution or criminal sexual activity. The Bad Boy rapper’s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, pointed out that the new indictment has no new charges, although it does include new claims of criminal behaviour.\n“The prosecution’s theory remains flawed,” he said, according toThe New York Times. “The government has added the ridiculous theory that two of Mr. Combs’s former girlfriends were not girlfriends at all, but were prostitutes. Mr. Combs is as committed as ever to fighting these charges and winning at trial.”\nThe amended indictment comes shortly after US District Judge Arun Subramaniandenied Combs access to the freak-off tapesin the case, siding with the prosecutors’ argument that providing the footage could create risks to the privacy and safety of his alleged victims.\nWhile the original indictment only referred to “Victim-1,”  it now includes “Victim-2” and “Victim-3.” Combs is alleged to have given drugs to victims to keep them “obedient and compliant” and recorded the sexual encounters. However, his lawyers have claimed that the sexual encounters were consensual.\n“In connection with the commercial sex acts, Combs provided the victims with, among other things, monetary payments, career opportunities, and payment of rent and housing expenses,” the indictment said.\nThe indictment also extends the alleged racketeering conspiracy surrounding a “criminal organisation” responsible for kidnapping and bribery, now dating back to 2004. Another allegation of kidnapping in New York claims that Combs was carrying and displaying a firearm.\nAs for thedangling allegations, a woman named Bryana Bongolan filed a lawsuit last year that aligns with the claims. Combs said he “firmly denies these serious allegations and remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless.”\nCombs’ trial is set to begin on May 5th. He’s currently detained at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and violating the Mann Act in September.",

        "description": "Kendrick Lamarwill headline the Super Bowl LVI halftime show at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 9th. Aside from the game itself, which will see the Kansas City Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles, much of the discussion has been around K.Dot potentially dissing Drake on the biggest stage of them all.\nThe Compton rapper landed a number-one single last year with his Drizzy diss track ‘Not Like Us‘. In the song, Kendrick accused him of being a “certified paedophile” and that he should be on “neighbourhood watch,” among other vicious lines.\nEarlier this month, Drakesued Universal Music Group for defamation, claiming the label “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response.”\nSpeaking toThe Los Angeles Times, renowned criminal defence attorney Ken White warned Kendrick against performing ‘Not Like Us’ at halftime. “I’m a defence lawyer, so of course I’m going to say, ‘Guys, don’t do this. It’s just going to give me a headache,'” he said. “I’m sure every general counsel with the network or the NFL is saying, ‘No, for the love of God, don’t do it.'”\nHe added, “But the halftime show has always been willing to showcase stuff that is somewhat edgy. So I don’t really know how they’ll play it, but if I were an in-house counsel, I’d be telling them not to do it.”\nDespite his comments, he admitted thatKendrick doesn’t face many risksdue to the fact that he wasn’t named in the Universal lawsuit. “There’s a risk, but it appears to be low because of the way that Drake has decided to do this,” he said. “He very deliberately went after UMG, and said this isn’t about Kendrick.\n“It was more like, ‘I don’t want to pick a fight with Kendrick, I only want to pick a fight with UMG.’ All he would be able to do is say, ‘UMG promoted this song at the Super Bowl, their hands got Kendrick Lamar the gig.'”\nOn the other hand, Drake won’t even be in the country during the Super Bowl due to his shows in Australia throughout February.",

        "description": "Sean ‘Diddy‘ Combs has been denied access to the “freak-off” videos being used in his sex trafficking and racketeering case ahead of the trial on May 5th. US District Judge Arun Subramanian reportedly ruled against Combs’ attempt to change a protective order restricting the defence’s access to the footage.\n“Defendant’s motion to amend the protective order is DENIED without prejudice,” the judge wrote in his ruling. He sided with the prosecutors’ argument that handing over the footage could create risks to the privacy and safety of his alleged victims.\nAccording toAllHipHop, if Combs’ team want to appeal the decision, Subramanian said, “If that happens, they should be prepared to clearly articulate why they need possession of the videos despite the options furnished by the Government.”\nHowever, prosecutors offered alternatives and allowed his legal team to view the footage while supervised. “To the extent these options are insufficient, the defence may propose other options to the Government,” the judge stated. “It doesn’t appear that the defence did this before raising the issue with the Court.”\nCombs has claimed that many videos being used show “fully consenting adults.” Combs’ lawyers filed a letter to the court on January 14th, claiming his “innocence” in the encounters known as “freak-offs.”\nThe letter read, “Any fair-minded viewer of the videos will quickly conclude that the prosecution of Mr Combs is both sexist and puritanical. The videos depict clearly consensual sex among willing adults in a decades-long relationship and fundamentally undermine the government’s case and Victim-1’s claims.”\nAccording to his team, complete, unabridged electronic copies are required to use their own experts to exploit the videos’ “full exculpatory value” ahead of the trial.\n“Protective orders are common in criminal cases, and we have one in this case that prevents the defence from physically possessing certain evidence,” Combs’ defence attorney Marc Agnifilo said. “So, we applied to the Court to allow us to possess the video evidence so we can, for instance, enhance the audibility.”\nFollowing thecharges against him in September, Combs is currently incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after being denied bail three times.",

The older brother of the Bay Area rapper died on the morning of January 29th after he was shot during a failed robbery in East Oakland.\nPolice said 61-year-old Wayne Shaw was shot at around 7am on Wednesday during an attempted heist at a marijuana grow house in the 1200 block of 49th Avenue. 911 calls and a gunshot detection system alert led officers to turn up at the location, finding Shaw wounded multiple times. After being taken to Highland Hospital, he died several hours later.\nAccording toMercury News, Oakland Police Department Deputy Chief Frederick Shavies said the shooting occurred after a car crashed into the marijuana grow house to get inside, causing Shaw to walk outside and suffer multiple gunshots.\nAt around 3:30pm that same day, a man exited the 49th Avenue building where the shooting took place and met another person outside. Both declined to comment on the shooting, but one of them said, “That was one of the worst days we’ve had.”\nPolice are searching for several suspects after no arrests were made; the incident marks the 12th death Oakland police are investigating as a homicide so far in 2025. Hip-hop producer Terry T, also known as Mr. Community, had high praise for Shaw, calling him a “guardian” for Too Short.\n“The streets really respected him,” he said during an interview. “He really was somebody who people looked at for advice. It’s not easy living in the shadow of a brother who was famous. And he was one of the greatest shadows you’d ever meet because he embraced the shadow.”\n58-year-old Too Short has been ainfluential figure in West Coast hip-hopsince the 1980s, best known for singles such as ‘Blow the Whistle’ and ‘The Ghetto’. He was born and raised in Los Angeles before moving to Oakland with his family in 1980. In 2022, Foothill Boulevard in Oakland was renamed Too Short Way in his honour.\nHe released his last album,Snoop Cube 40 Short, a collaboration with Snoop Dogg, E-40 and Ice Cube asMount Westmore, in December 2022.",

Since his inauguration, the American leader has signed a number of executive orders and has clamped down on immigration, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arresting and detaining those thought to be “illegal aliens.”\nCities such as Chicago have been targeted, and on January 26th, a record 956 people were arrested, according to reports. Gomez was holding back tears when she took to social media and reacted to the news. Her father, who is of Mexican descent, played a big part in her life. Central American immigrants, including Mexicans, have been heavily targeted by Trump in his efforts to curb illegal immigration to the US.\nTaking to Instagram, Gomez told her followers, “I just wanted to say that I’m so sorry. All my people are getting attacked. The children, I don’t understand. I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything, I promise.”\nThe singer andEmilia Perezstar swiftly decided to delete the video after facing a lot of backlash, and wrote in a subsequent story, “Apparently it’s not OK to show empathy for people.” Still,Flavor Flav of Public Enemy has come to Gomez’s defenceand praised her comments, writing on X (formerly Twitter), “Team Selena Gomez. Again. That woman is always so brave to share her truth, and so many are quick to bully her.”\nGomez is the most followed woman on Instagram, boasting 423 million followers, and the third most followed person after footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Gomez has spoken out on multiple occasions about the rights of migrants in the US and hosted the showLiving Undocumentedin 2019, which focused on undocumented migrants attempting to make a living and get papers in America while avoiding the fury of ICE.\nShe also wrote an explosive opinion piece forTime Magazine, telling the story of her aunt’s only journey across the US/Mexican border, which saw her gain access to America. A paragraph of her article read, “Undocumented immigration is an issue I think about every day, and I never forget how blessed I am to have been born in this country thanks to my family and the grace of circumstance.”\nOther celebrities, such as Madonna, have also recently called out the US Republican government and accused them of “slowly dismantling all the freedoms we have been fighting for.”\nIn other Flavor Flav news, the former Public Enemy hypeman recentlypartnered with GoFundMe to create a fundraiserfocused on helping black families who have been displaced by the Los Angeles wildfires.\nTeam Selena Gomez.

During a press conference on February 26th, seven arrests were announced for the murders of 13-year-olds Jakody Davis and Lamon Freeman, who were killed at a birthday party in July 2024.\nMajor Ralph Woolfolk claimed the shootings were the result of “cowardly acts” by Baby deciding to film a music video in a “rival gang stronghold” and starting a gang war. Baby’s attorneys, Drew Findling and Marissa Goldberg, have now condemned his comments.\n“The part of the press conference on Wednesday by the Atlanta Police Department that made an obvious reference to [Lil Baby] was complete and total nonsense,” they toldWSB-TV. “To say that he couldn’t shoot a music video in his hometown, a place that he loves and has continued to uplift, is disgraceful.\nThey continued: “Even more, the location for a major music video shoot is a decision made by a professional team and is not a decision made by any individual. Bringing his name into a conversation regarding a terrible crime for which he had absolutely no involvement is unprofessional, unethical and shameful.”\nThe message added, “[Lil Baby] is devastated about the situation because those children came from the same neighbourhood he did, and he will continue to build up his community in any way he can.”\nBaby also took to his Instagram Stories on February 27th, writing, “Thanks for all the concerns. Please don’t be misinformed by fake news!! I’m overly good.”\nA triple shooting took place on the set of Baby’s video in Northwest Atlanta last May. A police statement at the time read, “Upon arrival, officers located a 24-year-old male who sustained an apparent gunshot wound to the arm and a 27-year-old male who sustained an apparent gunshot wound to the back. Both of the males were alert, conscious, and breathing and were transported to the hospital for treatment.”\nIt continued, “Officers later located a 23-year-old male, who had been self-transported to the hospital, with an apparent gunshot wound to the neck.

In doing so, he also took shots at Spotify in a statement, saying, “I don’t fuck with Spotify anymore, I’m only on Tune.FM.” Snoop plans to move his music, including his Death Row material, over to the platform.\nSpotify came across his comments and responded to another claim Snoop made in December, in which he said he only received $45,000 for a billion streams.\nA spokesperson toldTMZ, “We can’t speak to endorsement deals for Web3 companies, but $45K for a billion streams? It’s well documented that a billion streams on Spotify generates millions of dollars to rights holders.”\n“It’s unfortunate to hear that Spotify’s payments didn’t make it through to Snoop. Snoop’s a legend and, hopefully now that he owns Death Row Records, he’s seeing more of that money.”\nSnoop’s criticism appeared on theBusiness Untitledpodcast, where he called out Spotify for the lack of money he receives for his music being streamed.\n“Let me tell you the thing that worked with me, it was simple, it was transparency,” he said about NFT technology. “That’s what the music industry and the film industry doesn’t have, so this was a way to show transparency. Give me a song, give me a song, I’m taking 60% ’cause I’m putting it out for you, you getting 40% that may sound like a lot but you just made $100,000.”\nHe continued, “They just sent me some shit from Spotify, where I got a billion streams, right? My publisher hit me. I said, ‘Break that down, how much money is that?’ That shit wasn’t even $45,000. You see what I’m saying? So it’s like, when this shit came out, I could tell an artist that same song that you put out traditionally that didn’t make no money, give it to me.

        "description": "50 Centhas responded to Jim Jones after the Harlem rapper called him a “sucker” during a recent interview. The Dipset member appeared onThe Breakfast Clubthis week to promote his new album,All the Church Steps, which was released on February 28th.\nDuring the conversation, the G-Unit boss’ name came up while discussing potential opponents for aVerzuzbattleagainst a New York rapper. Jones backed himself in a clash against anyone before becoming disgruntled at the mention of 50.\n“I got more solo records than most of them that really hit,” he said. “I got a lot of gold singles—I got some action with me. Gon’ be hard for a lot of people from New York to win with Capo, and I got freestyles I could do. In New York City it’s gon’ be hard, I would say that, for anybody.”\nWhen DJ Envy suggested he shouldavoid battling 50, Jones replied, “I wouldn’t do nothing with that sucker, you heard? Leave him out the conversation, don’t start.”\n50 came across his comments and posted a clip from the interview on Instagram, claiming Jones only has one hit single that he didn’t even write. He also stated Bronx rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie is miles ahead of him. 50 wrote in the caption, “Delusional JoMo only got one song, Ballin written by Max B,” he wrote. “Da fuck he think he @aboogievsartist Fvcking PUNK!”\nShortly after, 50 appeared to target Jones once again. He shared a photo of himself reading with a glass of wine, adding in the caption, “I been waiting to say this, ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SOMETHING PUNK. YOU GIRLY MOUTH BOY!”\nJones and 50 have been going back and forth with jabs this year. During an episode ofTalk with Flee, 50 spoke to Cam’ron about Jones joining him on stage in New York City in 2007 at the height of Dipset’s issues, which Cam saw as a betrayal.\nOn Justin LaBoy’sRespectfullypodcast, Jones replied, “Them n*ggas be on my dick,” he said. “Them n*ggas ain’t got nothing else to think about but Capo. I did a lot for them n*ggas in their life, ya heard? Both of them. Pause, though. Get off my dick! It’s only space on there for baby girl. Come on, man. Tugging on my shit like that.”\nA post shared by 50 Cent (@50cent)",

        "title": "Former Def Jam president Kevin Liles sued for sexual assault in early 2000s",
        "description": "Kevin Liles was hit with a sexual assault lawsuit filed in Manhattan on February 27th. The record executive was named alongside Universal Music Group andhip-hoplabel Def Jam Recordings, with an anonymous woman claiming he sexually assaulted her when she was his assistant between 2000 and 2002.\nShe claims she was hired in 1999, and Liles went on to sexually harass her several times. He allegedly “pressed his body against [her] breasts” and “grabbed [her] on the buttocks.”\nIn 2002, Liles is said to have made “sexually inappropriate comments and advances. Kevin Liles proceeded to physically force himself on top of [Jane Doe] where he began to sexually assault and ultimately rape her despite her continued protests.”\nShe’s asking for compensatory and punitive damages, claiming UMG and Def Jam “enabled, permitted, directed, controlled, approved, managed, operated and ratified the manner in which Liles engaged with employees.” The lawsuit was filed against Liles on his 57th birthday before the lookback window, which allows plaintiffs to file lawsuits that would usually be too old, closes on March 1st.\nLiles immediately denied the allegations in a statement toRolling Stone, assuring he was determined to clear his name of any wrongdoing.\n“I absolutely deny the outrageous claims reported in the press this evening,” he said. “After nearly 40 years of service to our culture, I’ve intentionally built a reputation for doing things the right way, treating people the right way, and empowering women. It is a shameful reality that these lies spread so freely.”\nHe added, “My attorneys and I will fully clear my name, and when we are successful, this anonymous accuser and her attorney will face a defamation lawsuit and every other available legal consequence.”\nLiles was president of Def Jam between 1999 and 2004 and later became executive vice president ofWarner Music Group. He founded 300 Entertainment in 2012 alongside Lyor Cohen, Todd Moscowitz, and Roger Gold; the label’s roster includes Young Thug, Gunna and Mary J Blige.\nIn September, Liles announced he was leaving the company. “I want to create more millionaires and more brands,” he toldHot 97. “So I think it’s important that [300 Entertainment] was a moment in time. I’m very supportive. I want them to be great, but God is calling me to do something bigger.”\nFor help, advice or more information regarding sexual harassment, assault and rape in the UK, visit theRape Crisis charity website.

        "title": "Drake thanks industry friends who “didn’t turn pussy” on him after Kendrick feud",
        "description": "Drakehas begun to arbitrarily speak out again about betrayal and other anonymous people he believes haven’t had his back in the industry. Following his feud with Kendrick Lamar, many MCs and producers distanced themselves from the Scorpion creator for fear of being seen as a cultural pariah and perceived loser.\nHowever, this has only made Drake more frustrated, angry and outspoken about what he sees as significant betrayals of trust and friendship. Although herecently released$ome $exy $ongs 4 Ualongside PARTYNEXTDOOR,it appears Drake is not very interested in promoting it.\nDuring his recent ‘Anita Max Wynn’ tour in Australia, Drake spoke to the crowd to give a shoutout to all his industry friends who “didn’t turn pussy” on him. Although Drizzy was performing in sold-out arenas, hecancelled a leg of his tour because of a “scheduling conflict.”\nThe tour was meant to be an Australasia tour covering all the major Australian cities as well as cities in New Zealand. This tour was his first in the region in eight years. The last show he did was in Brisbane on February 24th, during which he thanked his loyal collaborators and exclaimed, “All the other artists that I work with, you know, the ones that didn’t turn pussy on me, the ones that’s still real, my real ones. I appreciate you because you’ve changed my life for me and everybody around me.”\nMany people have actively chosen to stay away from Drake since the release of ‘Not Like Us’. The scathing diss track swept up several Grammys at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for 22 consecutive weeks.\nThe DJ-Mustard-produced song contained lyrics labelling Drake a “certified paedophile,” “a f*cking coloniser,” and suggesting that he “likes them young.” That said, the sheer success of the song made Drizzy a laughing stock in the industry, with whom not many are looking to collaborate.\nThe ramifications of the track led Drake to file a lawsuit against his record label, Universal Music Group (UMG). On January 15th, the Toronto native filed an 81-page lawsuit asserting that the track was “false and defamatory.” Furthermore, he cited the “accusations of paedophilia” as particularly defamatory.\nMany believe Drake only filed the lawsuit to prevent Kendrick Lamar from performing ‘Not Like Us’ at the Super Bowl Halftime show. That said, since Lamar’s performance, Drizzy has not ceased legal action. Still, he recently made some changes. According to Universal Music Group’s attorney, Drake has edited the initial documentation and dropped some “key allegations” from the lawsuit.\nThe record label’s attorney, Rollin A. Ransom, recently wrote a letter to the court requesting that the pretrial conference (currently scheduled for April 2nd) be delayed so they can consider a new motion to dismiss the case UMG plans on filing. It has been reported that Drizzy will retract his allegation that UMG whitelisted reaction videos by well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers so they could publicly promote the video without copyright claims.\nHowever, from this latest footage from his performance in Brisbane, it appears Drake’s loss last year is still mentally affecting him.\nDrake Addresses Fake Artists & Friends During His Show In Brisbane#Drakepic.twitter.com/fZlcucFkvx",

        "description": "Drakefiled a legal petition in November, claiming Universal Music Group may have paid iHeartMedia to play Kendrick Lamar’s diss track ‘Not Like Us’ on radio stations nationwide. However, Drizzy has now removed iHeartMedia from the filing following an “amicable resolution.”\n“Petitioner Aubrey Drake Graham files this notice of nonsuit without prejudice of his rule 202 petition as to iHeartMedia, Inc only,” the filing reads. “Petition and iHeartMedia Inc have reached an amicable resolution of the dispute to the satisfaction of both sides.”\nInstead of being a lawsuit, the filing was a pre-action petition that asked for depositions from UMG and iHeartMedia representatives for a potential lawsuit in Bexar County, Texas.Another petitionwas filed against UMG and Spotify in New York shortly before that.\nUniversal pushed back against Drake’s claims in November, writing in a statement, “The suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.”\nThe petition hassince turned into a lawsuit, accusing UMG of harassing him through ‘Not Like Us’. Drizzy’s suit claimed Universal “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response.”\nIn response, Universal said, “Not only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist — let alone Drake — is illogical. We have invested massively in his music, and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.”\nThey added, “Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth’ rap battles’ to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist’s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist’s music.”\nDrake’s legal team submitted documents to Bexar County District Court where they dismissed only iHeartMedia from the Texas petition for pre-suit discovery.According to the filing, both parties “have reached an amicable resolution of the dispute to the satisfaction of both…pic.twitter.com/SJaMUzMDc9",

        "title": "Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs hit with four more sexual assault lawsuits in New York",
        "description": "Sean ‘Diddy‘ Combs is facing further sexual assault lawsuits. Four more suits were filed under the Gender-Motivated Violence Act before the lookback window closes on March 1st, following atemporary statute of limitations extension.\nAll four lawsuits were filed in New York, with the alleged victims claiming they weredrugged and subjected to sexual actswithout their permission. The Gender-Motivated Violence Act window is between March 1st, 2023 and March 1st, 2025, with more suits expected to be filed before the end of the week.\nThe first suit from Aristalia Benitez alleges that in 1995, at the age of 20, she worked at Peppe Jeans and went to a party which Combs attended. While sipping on a non-alcoholic drink, Combs is said to have “forcibly groped and fondled [her] breasts, butt, and genital area under her clothes.” Benitez claims she woke up in a taxi with a sore groin and a covered fare. She says she was vaginally penetrated by Combs and his associates while unconscious.\nThe second lawsuit from Justin Gooch claims he was given ketamine and anally penetrated by Combs without consent. The incident allegedly took place at New York City nightclub Tunnel in 1999 when Gooch was 16 after Combs invited him to the bathroom. Afterwards, Combs is said to have told the man, “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”\nA third lawsuitfrom Leslie Cockrell recounts an incident in 1999 when she was 24. At a party in the Hamptons, Combs allegedly gave her a drink and touched her while giving her a tour around the house. She says the mansion was “packed inside and outside with naked people who were engaging in sexual activities together.” Cockrell claims she woke up to Combs vaginally penetrating her without consent, having previously felt woozy after her second drink. She was allegedly sore and told not to tell anyone.\nIn the final lawsuit, Kendra Haffoney claims Combs “guided her head down to have her perform oral sex on him” in a backroom of an afterparty after taking a drink she believes was laced. She alleges “her vaginal area felt sore” after waking up with Combs at the end of the bed. At the time, she was said to be working for the VH1 reality showI Want to Work for Diddy.\nIn a statement toVariety, Combs’ legal team said, “No matter how many lawsuits are filed—especially by individuals who refuse to put their own names behind their claims—it won’t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor.\n“This lawsuit is nothing more than a collection of media headlines, stitched together with fragments from other lawsuits and baseless rumors. With the deadline for New York’s Gender-Motivated Violence Act expiring tomorrow, opportunists are scrambling to file last-minute, meritless claims.”\nThe statement concluded, “We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason, but that does not make the claims true. Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail in court.” Combs, who has beencharged with sex trafficking and racketeering, is set to begin his trial on May 5th. Until then, he will remain at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.",

        "title": "Former Kanye West employee suing rapper for $300,000",
        "description": "Kanye Westhas had a lot of bad press recently, and things only seem to be getting worse as one of his former employees is seeking $300,000 in damages after being allegedly mistreated by the producer who had hired him to investigate Bianca Censori and The Kardashians.\nThe lawsuit, filed anonymously under the pseudonym John Doe, alleges he was West’s former director of intelligence. The lawsuit, which was filed in October 2024, sought punitive measures for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress and various violations of the California state labour code.\nAccording to new reports byIn Touchmagazine,the Chicago musicianinitially hired the accuser as the deputy campaign director when West was looking to run for president. However, his role was allegedly changed to Director of Intelligence against his will in 2022. The accuser has insisted that West tasked him with investigating Kim Kardashian’s family.\nThe suit highlights, “Doe would spend time fixing certain problems of Ye himself, such as items that were stolen or lost, prompting further investigations. It was common for Ye to lose expensive cars or fail to pay people for services rendered at Ye’s direction.”\nAside from investigating all members of the Kardashian family, it has now been alleged that, during this period, West demanded investigations into his wife, Bianca Censori. In the court papers, John Doe’s lawyer explains, “A particularly notable task by Ye was to have Doe hire private investigators to follow and ‘tail’ his wife, Bianca Censori, when she was travelling alone to visit family in Australia, without Ms. Censori’s knowledge.”\nIn a bombshell revelation, the court documents have revealed that Kanye’s alleged bad behaviour began when he decided to get titanium teeth. The accuser has suggested the inhalation of nitrous oxide may have exacerbated some of West’s negative behaviour.\nAs reported byIn Touch,at the time, John Doe “speculated [the drug] led to some of the erratic behaviour [by] Ye during this time.” In the filing, the accuser recalls receiving calls from an employee at West’s Donda Academy raising concerns about the musician’s demeanour.\nStill, after supposedly confronting theCollege Dropoutcreator, West berated him on the phone. A lawyer for John, who said he is a military veteran diagnosed with PTSD, said, “The stress and trauma caused by the threats, hostile work environment, and [John’s] exposure to illegal and unethical activities severely impacted his mental and emotional well-being.”\nThe lawyer added, “[John] experienced panic attacks, anxiety and severe emotional distress, which caused him to seek medical treatment and was placed in a facility to address his declining mental health.” Kanye West’s representative, Milo Yiannopoulos, has spoken toPage Sixto denounce and refute the claims made in the lawsuit, telling the publication, “Many of the details in his complaint are simply fantastical and false….designed to cause embarrassment, and/orcapitalize on perceived problems in Ye’s marriage.”",

        "description": "Despite being behind bars in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre, Sean ‘Diddy‘ Combs is still being hit with lawsuits. The most recent lawsuit has been filed by a male escort who alleges that Combs hired him to engage in a “freak-off” with the mogul and an anonymous female companion.\nThe lawsuit has been filed anonymously, only identified as John Doe. In his lawsuit, the escort alleges that Combs threatened to harm him physically and claims the musician made reference to “Pac,” known to many as Tupac Shakur, who was murdered after a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996.\nJohn Doe alleges in the lawsuit that his interactions with the Bad Boy founder began in 2012 when he met Combs through a male escort company he worked for in Florida. The unnamed accuser recalled how he would often travel to New York City to have sex with Combs at the Intercontinental Hotel. However, he insists that it was during one of these trips that Combs abused him.\nRecalling the event, John Doe says that after he entered the room, he was met by the producer and his female companion, after which he wasinstructed to perform oral sexon the woman for hours while the mogul began participating in some unspecified degrading sex acts.\nThis latest lawsuit has arrived amid a federal investigation into Combs’ “Freak Off” sex parties and the escorts involved. One federal law enforcement source has unveiled, “They’re all too happy to talk.” Speaking about the investigation, the officer explained, “We’re asking them about their recollections of the Freak Offs, what they were paid to do, and who else was involved. I’m surprised how many of them can recall intricate details about what happened.”\nCombs’ legal team have discredited the latest lawsuit, tellingTMZ, “No matter how many lawsuits are filed — especially by individuals who refuse to put their own names behind their claims — it won’t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone — man or woman, adult or minor.”\nCombs’ lawyers continued, “We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth, and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail in court.”\nFollowing the string of lawsuits filed by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee, Sean’ Diddy’ Combs recentlyaccused him of “egregious misconduct”, with Combs’ legal team writing, “In our collective decades of practice, undersigned counsel have never opposed a pro hac vice application, and we do not do so lightly here. But Buzbee’s egregious misconduct warrants denial of the privilege of appearing in this district.”\nDiddy Sued by Male Escort for Alleged Sexual Assault During 'Freak-Off'   |  Click to read more 👇https://t.co/FwMR8wbHax",

Tune.FM describes itself as “a streaming platform built by artists, for artists—one that prioritises musicians’ earnings and creative control.”\nSnoop is frustrated with the current streaming situation for musicians, receiving little to nothing per stream and facing long royalty payout cycles. Now, he’s pushing for a fairer ecosystem for artists.

Through Tune.FM, he’s planning to host fan experiences and giveaways, including a private event at his house and VIP prize tiers.\nA Tune.FM spokesperson added, “Tune.FM operates under non-exclusive licensing agreements, enabling us to unlock new revenue streams for under-monetized catalogs and artist IP on both our streaming platform and marketplace. We can share that major distributors and labels are increasingly coming on board to upload catalogues that have long been under-monetised.”\nSnoop released his latest album,Missionary, in December. Dr. Dre entirely produced the project, which was notably available through Spotify butperformed underwhelminglyon the Billboard 200.\nThe album only cracked number 20 on the chart despite reuniting with his mentor on the production and recruiting Eminem, 50 Cent, Method Man, Tom Petty, and Jelly Roll, among others, as features.

Despite working together in the past, Ye has asserted that his 2021 song ‘Moon’, a collaboration with Don Toliver on hisDondaalbum, is better than anything Ocean has ever recorded.\nDuring his recent interview with Akademiks, Kanye claimed he’s the reason why Ocean hasn’t released an album since 2016’sBlonde. He also referenced lyrics from a recent Ocean snippet that appeared in a vlog from his rumoured UFC fighter boyfriend, Payton Talbott.\n“No one makes music that’s nowhere as near as good as [me],” he said. “When I made ‘Moon’, it basically ended Frank Ocean’s [career]. He ain’t have a song since then. He was like, ‘Sipping some wine.’ I heard it and was like, ‘Oh, this n*gga’s never gonna be able to make another album again.’ Any genre of music that anyone has, I make a better version of it.”\nKanye collaborated with Ocean on ‘Frank’s Track’ from 2016’sThe Life of Pabloalbum and ‘New Slaves’ from 2013’sYeezus. Ocean was also featured in ‘No Church in the Wild’ and ‘Made in America’ from Ye’sWatch the Thronealbum with Jay-Z in 2012.\nDuring an interview withSHOWstudioin 2015, Kanye praised Ocean for coming out as gay and his impact on society. “Like, people don’t have a problem with white rappers now because Eminem ended up being the greatest artist, and everyone thought that with Frank Ocean,” he said.\n“I think it’s so cliché to mention him with this subject, but there always are people who broke the ground and I think he is the one who broke the ground because people don’t give a fuck. People love his music so much. The people who break the stereotypes make history.”\nThen, in 2016, he said he would boycott theGrammy Awardsif Ocean wasn’t nominated forBlonde. “The album I listen to the most this year is Frank Ocean’s album,” he said on tour. “I’ll tell you this right now: if his album’s not nominated in no categories, I’m not showin’ up to the Grammys.”\nA post shared by CLOUDED (@clouded.culture)",

        "description": "Erykah Baduhas joined one of the most politically divisive conversations in America surrounding Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. Ever since announcing that he was going to help finance Donald Trump’s 2024 election run, Musk has been persona non grata in the eyes of many which has led to Tesla receiving a backlash by proxy of association.\nWith the gap between supporters of the Democrat and Republican parties widening, Musk’s Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has created political chaos in America which has inadvertently led to a wave of vandalism. People have been destroying Tesla cars and trashing the company’s dealerships in protest, and Erykah Badu has now commented on this craze.\nTaking to social media, the ‘On & On’ vocalist made a joke, writing, “Just vandalized my own Tesla. Trying to stay on trend.” The neo-soul icon is highlighting what many are calling the extreme action many Democrats are taking by wrecking people’s Tesla cyber trucks and attacking the brand by bringing attention to many of the vehicles’ shortcomings.\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Musk expressed dismay, stating, “It’s really come as quite a shock to me that there is this level of, really, hatred and violence from the left.”\nHe continued, “I always thought that the left, you know, Democrats, were supposed to be the party of empathy, the party of caring, and yet they’re burning down cars, they’re firebombing dealerships, they’re firing bullets into dealerships, they’re smashing up Teslas.”\nBadu is known for adding a bit of levity to heavy political issues on social media. However, fans of the singer are more excited at the prospectof her releasing a new album.It will be her first project in 15 years with her last body of work being 2010’sNew Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh).\nBadu was recently honoured by Billboard for her contributions to music and was given the Icon Award at the Billboard Women in Music 2025 ceremony which cemented her status as one of the most groundbreaking voices in modern soul music.\nThe last time Badu was in the news, she was beinglambasted for calling out Beyoncé, who she insisted copied her style of wearing oversized hats. The provocative post undoubtedly started a conversation, but now her fans await an album.\nJust vandalized my own Tesla.Trying to stay on trend.",

Ye recently met up with Akademiks for an hour-long interview wearing a black KKK outfit.\nDuring their conversation, he admitted that he knew he didn’t want to get his ex-wife pregnant after just months of being together. “I didn’t wanna have children with this person after the first two months of being with her,” he said. “But that wasn’t God’s plan.”\nYe took responsibility for putting himself in a situation where people weren’t speaking up for him when Kardashian allegedly wouldn’t let him see his kids. “No, that was my fault,” he said.\nThe former couple have four children: North, Chicago, Saint, and Psalm. Kardashian addressed Kanye’s allegations during anAngie Martinez IRLpodcast episode.\n“The testing of my character to make me look, like, out of my character is the one thing that’s hard,” she said. “Because there’s already so many people have that energy … that are, like, these haters of me and the fam anyway. So it’s really hard when there’s people that were once close [making false claims].”\nShe added, “Especially for my kids — like, why would you even want to anyone to think that of your mum? … That’s what’s hard for me.”\nAddressingher breakup with Ye, she said, “I feel free of things. There’s moments — you’ll have your moment, but I’d say in this last year, this year for me, even though I got emotional before talking about Kanye, I feel free in the sense that I am not anybody else.”\nShe added, “I don’t hold anybody else’s thoughts, opinions, burdens, and I used to hold this guilt that I wasn’t there to fix situations, and I wasn’t there to put it all back together. … [Now] I’m free.”\nKanye West goes off on JAY-Z, Pusha T, and John Legend, and admits he made a mistake getting Kim Kardashian pregnant.😳pic.twitter.com/Vq2g2O5OK6",

The duo allegedly took part in a “scheme to defraud victim sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewellery, and other goods purchased by the defendants through the use of fraudulent documents.”\nThe verdict was delivered to Kingston (real name Kisean Anderson) on March 28th, after almost four hours of deliberations, during thefinal day of his trialin Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

They could face up to 20 years for the six charged counts.\nThe indictment claimed their fraud scheme lasted until March 2024. Initially pleading not guilty to all counts, Kingston was arrested in Fort Irwin, California, in May 2024 on a warrant issued by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida after his home was raided.\nThe pair wereindicted in July 2024. Kingston was accused of using his fame and social media accounts to convince sellers to deliver items before payment.\nThey allegedly “enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment” on the purchases but never sent the money, and they are said to have stolen around $1 million worth of property.\nKingston is best known for his 2007 hit single, ‘Beautiful Girls’, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks.

        "description": "Dallas rapperYella Beezyhas been released from Dallas County Jail after paying a $750K bond. The ‘Rich MF’ emcee was behind bars following a grand jury indictment for a suspected murder-for-hire plot. However, new footage has emerged.\nThe investigation taking place concerns a 2020 incident that saw the murder of Dallas emcee Mo3. The new footage that recently surfaced shows the late Mo3 being chased in a car on a highway before being fatally shot in broad daylight.\nBeezy’s initial bond was set at $2 million. However, asCBSreported, in accordance with Texas bail bond laws,the Oak Cliff nativewas able to bail out by paying over 10% of the total sum owed. The decision to release Beezy was made on March 27th.\nThe artist’s legal team recently toldTMZthat the newly seen footage has been entered into evidence and asserted that the ‘Raccs’ rhymer intends to plead not guilty. Speaking to the outlet, his lawyers explained, “We look forward to fighting the case in court — Yella denies the charges.”\nHis legal team added, “Mo3 was gunned down in November 2020 on Interstate 35E near Marsalis Avenue, where he was pursued by a balaclava-clad shooter after running from his vehicle.” They also insisted it had nothing to do with their client (Yella Beezy) and reaffirmed that they would fight the charges in court.\nYella Beezy has not been accused of carrying out the hit on Mo3but has been accused of “orchestrating” his murderand hiring someone to kill his rival on his behalf. White is already behind bars in federal prison, serving a nine-year sentence on gun and drug charges related to the murder. Still, he has not been charged with murder.\nUnlike YNW Melly’s court case, the prosecution in Yella Beezy’s case has not yet commented on whether they will pursue the death penalty against the rapper, as Texas is a capital punishment state. Although the investigation into Beezy is still taking place, what is known is that the emcee Mo3 were feuding at the time of the murder. Furthermore, Dallas police had reported a prior incident involving the rapper and Mo3’s manager fighting outside a nightclub.",

The controversial rapper was scheduled to perform in the US capital in October 2018 but decided to ditch the concert in favour of a competing event.\nA judge ruled that 6ix9ine breached a signed performance agreement by not appearing on stage, with the US District Court telling him to pay compensatory damages to Hits Before Fame LLC and After Hours LLC.\nThe event was set to occur at Echostage to coincide with Howard University’s homecoming. 6ix9ine took around $60,000 from promoters but disappeared. Then, he appeared at Powerhouse at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.\nAccording toAllHipHop, the court ruled that 6ix9ine violated the terms of his contract after months of rescheduling, renegotiating, and receiving wire transfers and cash. His team cut all communication with the promoters when ticket sales exceeded $165,000, VIP tables sold out, and more than 3,000 fans waited outside in the rain.\nWhen 6ix9ine didn’t show up, Echostage cancelled the concert 30 minutes before opening to avoid a riot among fans. Despite being awarded $250,000, the judge rejected the promoters’ defamation and unjust enrichment claims, saying there was insufficient evidence or conflicting logic.\nFederal officers and local policeraided 6ix9ine’s Florida homeon March 12th. He claimed guns and drugs were seized but denied any wrongdoing while alleging he was handcuffed for six hours. Not only that, but he said DNA samples were taken from him while his property was wrecked.\nThe Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office said federal US Probation officers executed a search warrant with help from Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office Narcotics Investigators.

His former psychiatrist, Dr Charles Sophy, sued the NWA rapper for $10 million in October 2024.\nSophy claimed Dre subjected him to a “systematic and malicious” barrage of “unbearable harassment” through text messages, resulting in him wearing a bulletproof vest and fearing for his life. Dre tried to get rid of the suit but was denied by Judge Mark H. Epstein on March 27th.\nWhen he sent the first messages, Dre said he intended to pursue his “legal options” with a medical board complaint. “It looks like a bunch of angry [messages] and I don’t see how they further the process of a medical board complaint,” the judge said. “He’s just hurling insults.”\nAccording toRolling Stone, Sophy was Dre’s family therapist and mediator during his 2021divorce from his ex-wife, Nicole. Dre claims he sent the texts to Sophy because he found malpractice.\n“I discovered that Sophy had attempted to poison my relationship with my son, including by urging him to disclose my financial records to the media as part of his attempts to pressure me into settling my divorce on unfair terms,” Dre said in January.\nHe added, “I used strong language, at times rough, because I was deeply upset about his unethical conduct and was serious about my warnings to him that I would pursue my legal remedies.”\nDre called Sophy a “bitch” and a “piece of shit” and told Sophy he was “going to have to pay” for his allegedinteraction with his son. He also told him that he had “fucked up” and “fucked with the wrong one.”\nHis lawyer, Jackson Trugman, stated his client was “trying to hold the doctor accountable for alleged misconduct and seeking an explanation and an apology.”",

Documents claim Dixon believes Joe blocked him from record label funding, prompting him to approach Joe about compensation for working on several songs.\nAccording toComplex, Dixon sent a written compensation request as a “ghostwriter and uncredited vocalist” on March 23rd. Then, on April 21st, Dixon and his lawyer, Tyrone Blackburn, allegedly threatened to file a complaint with sex trafficking, statutory rape, fraud and forced labor accusations, which Joe denies.\nJoe claims Blackburn threatened him over email with messages that include, “We will report him to Homeland Security,” “playtime is over,” and the “case has just expanded into a civil RICO case.” Dixon also posted accusations on Instagram, alleging that Joe was sleeping with an underage girl and referring to the Terror Squad rapper as a paedophile.\nIn a statement,Fat Joe said, “These allegations are completely false and part of a criminal conspiracy orchestrated between a disgruntled former hype man and his attorney. These two individuals have been scheming together to extort me with their elaborate and ludicrous demands changing by the day.\n“The relentless threats, harassment, and defamation I’ve endured as they peddle salacious lies are utterly deplorable. I’m taking legal action to expose their misconduct and I’m fully confident that the facts will reveal this is nothing more than a deceptive and desperate scam.”\nBlackburn claims Joe filed “a baseless lawsuit in an effort to soften the blow of what’s to come.

On May 29th, the ‘Crazy In Love’ vocalist performed for a sold-out SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. However, an unexpected brawl occurred between a group of ladies during the concert.\nThe fight supposedly happened as fans left the stadium, but more precisely, near the VIP lounge. As reported byTMZ,some Beyoncé fans got into an argument as they were leaving the section, but it is thought that tensions may have already been flaring before they left.\nAs several videos surfaced, fans saw that one of the women fighting was wearing a light blue denim jacket and a white cowgirl hat. However, another woman knocked the hat off her head after getting in her face and shouting. One person present attempted to mediate the situation, and viewers have assumed that it was a friend of the woman in the cowgirl hat.\nThe woman trying to calm the situation was wearing a red top, and while attempting to intervene, she was shoved to the ground violently. The first female seen with the hat then tries to stick up for her friend, and then also falls to the floor after getting an aggressive push. Following this, the situation just escalated, and someone ended up kicking the woman in the white hat with heavy cowboy boots while she was on the ground.\nAlthough Beyoncé’sCowboy Carter tour is now officially underway, she is not on an extensive world tour and will only hit major cities in the US and Europe, including the likes of Paris, Chicago, New Jersey, and Atlanta. The Cowboy Carter tour will officially finish on July 26th in Las Vegas.\nCowboy CarterwasBeyoncé’s first country albumand earned her her first ‘Album of the Year’ Grammy of all time.",

The Chicago rapper is currently detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles in connection with the death of Quando Rondo’s cousin, Saviay’a Robinson.\nFeds have reportedly claimed an unreleased song called ‘Scoom his Ass’, alleging the lyrics “corroborate defendant’s danger.” They cite the lyrics “riding through Beverly Hills with choppers” and Durk referring to himself as a “bounty hunter,” claiming they “have a striking similarity to the modus operandi used to kill [Robinson].”\nIn an April 28th filing obtained byComplex, prosecutors said, “Although ‘Scoom His Ass’ does not appear to have been officially released by defendant, the lyrics are authentic as the government seized the audio file from a co-conspirator’s cellular phone pursuant to a federal search warrant, which has been produced to the defence.”\nDurk has beencharged with one count of conspiracy, one count of use of interstate facilities to commit murder-for-hire resulting in death, and one count of using, carrying, and discharging firearms and a machine gun and possession of such firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence resulting in death. His trial is set to begin on October 14th, 2025.\nIn a recent phone call with DJ Akademiks, Lil Durk gave an update on life behind bars. “I’ve been good, man,” he said. “Mentally, spiritually, I’ve been on top of my shit. I’ll be back out there, you hear me? Oh, thank you, I need all the prayers. I appreciate you. Yeah, you know, ain’t nothing changed, bro. I’ve just been focused on life, my family and stuff like that.”\nHe added, “I’m trying to learn to speak Arabic in here. It’s a couple of guys in here that know how to speak Arabic fluently. So I’m just learning the different words and tightening up my Arabic. Just getting my knowledge together.”\nHis father, Dontay Banks, recently claimed his son had beenhelping inmates convert to Islam. “[Durk] was telling me that when he came in, there was like four Muslims on the block,” he said. “He said now it’s 17 Muslims on the block, so he in there converting.”",

That said, he recently revealed that he is  “staying positive” about Trump and his policies despite his controversial first 100 days in office.\nDuring an interview withFox News Digital,the St. Louis native insisted that he is an optimist and will always try to look for the best in people, stating, “I’m all for everybody staying positive about any and everything. I’m a glass-half-full type of guy. I’m more empowered by bringing people together and making sure that we all get what we need, when we need it, and why we need it.”\nNelly was in the news in January this year forperforming at Trump’s Liberty Ball event, which celebrated his inauguration as president. He wasn’t the only emcee there; the ‘Flap Your Wings’ took to the stage alongside legends like Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, and Soulja Boy.\nAfter the Liberty Ball event,Nelly spoke to Willie D to address the backlash he receivedfor endorsing Trump and the Republican party, stating, “I thought you were riding for me because I put on for my city, I didn’t know that I had to agree with your political choices.” He continued,  “I thought it was the things you do (that count). Not the things you say should be done. If you follow what I do, this shouldn’t even be an argument. He’s the president. He won.”\nAt the time, many fans of Nelly were under the assumption that the ‘Dilemma’ lyricist didn’t really support Donald Trump and theorised that he was just in need of a quick paycheque. In response to that theory, Nelly told Willie D,  “I’m not doing this for money. I’m doing this because it’s an honour. I respect the office. It don’t matter who is in office. The same way our brothers and sisters go to war to put their life on the line for whoever is in office. So, if they can put their life on the line for whoever is in office, I can damn sure perform for whoever is in office.”\nThis Nelly drama comes after Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley was criticised over the weekend for golfing with Trump after his team’s Super Bowl win.",

It definitely wasn’t done intentionally. It wasn’t done to bring harm to him. One of the reasons I settled [is] I got respect for Terry, so that means I’ve got respect for his family.\n“I didn’t want to put the family through more pain. It’s not that I did anything wrong. I never would have.

It’s been very, very difficult. I’ve been in pain eversince January 29, 2015, I haven’t had a good day, not one good day.\n“I’m not happy with the outcome of it, at all, but I don’t want to give him another opportunity to put on a clown show and act like a bitch.

That said, he hasn’t been resting on laurels and recently came out with a new fragrance named The Summer Mink.\nThis latest business endeavour has seen Drizzy craft his own fragrance, which he has released through his Better World Fragrance House brand. Named The Summer Mink, the exclusive Eau de Parfum is available throughout North America and costs $148 and will be in multiple Ulta Beauty stores from May 12th.\nTo promote this new fragrance, Drake appeared in a new commercial during which he delves into the science of crafting the perfect formula for a fragrance and after saying,  “F*ck. F*ck, that’s good,” he comes to his conclusion deciding, “That’s it. That’s it.”\nAfter Better World Fragrance House posted the commercial on its Instagram, fans reacted positively to the advertisement. One user responded, “Bruh, he’s actually a good actor. You can tell he’s having fun doing it.” Another added, “Drake, we need the album asap. I got enemies and fine shyts waiting on me to pop up.”\nThe senior perfumer at Givaudan, Michael Carby, gave an in-depth description of what Drizzy was trying to accomplish with this fragrance in a press release, writing, “Summer Mink was inspired by a yin-yang principle of fusing warm, creamy base notes with cold spices and sparkling citruses. The ingredient composition was uniquely crafted to reflect a multinational culture with aspirations toward a Better World.”\nAs well as releasing this exciting new fragrance, theScorpioncreator is also working on a new solo studio album, the first since his feud with Kendrick Lamar. He announced his latest projectduring a Kick livestream with Adin Rossand told fans,  “Thank you to everybody that’s streaming the album. Every time, every journey. Working on a new album, it’s a slap.” He also confirmed that it’s a solo project.”\nThere is mystery surrounding new body of work apart from two Instagram posts, one reading, “new chapter” and another stating, “U know I grew up non-confrontational and always treated this game as a sport where my pen won gold, but these days the podium has been hard for all of us to ignore. I understand that this next chapter may leave you feeling uneasy, but I hope you see my honesty as clarity, not charity that answers some questions, especially about the unanswered texts you’ve been sending me.”\nDrake for Better World Fragrance House (2025)pic.twitter.com/huO6sBNIhb",

        "description": "50 Centhas mocked Beyoncé for her reported lack of ticket sales. The G-Unit rapper took to Instagram on April 28th to react to a news story about the singer’s tour not selling out.\nOn his page, he posted a screenshot of the headline, “Beyoncé Tour Kicking Off In LA, But Sales Still With Thousands of Tickets Still Available.” No stranger to causing a stir with his views on Instagram, 50 wrote in the caption, “Shit getting real out here. Hey the tickets ain’t selling?”\nTheCowboy Carter Tourbegan on April 28th in Los Angeles, and it has dates scheduled in Chicago, London, Houston, Atlanta, and other major cities.\n50 has had a long-time beef with Beyoncé’s husband, Jay-Z. The ‘Candy Shop’ artist claimed Hov tried toblock him from performing at the Super Bowlwith Dr Dre in 2022 until Eminem stepped in.\nDuring an interview, 50 claimed that Jay’s marriage to Beyoncé was the reason for his success. “The same concept with the Super Bowl,” he toldXXL. “See, they don’t understand the relationship. They were trying to get [Eminem] to do the Super Bowl without me. It wasn’t happening.\n“It’s OK for the award shows not to give me the trophies. Even Jay-Z’s career, you can look at that and say the association to Beyoncé is when he started to receive the 16, 17 Grammys, since he’s been with Beyoncé. And you go, prior to that… [he had] one. That came with the association.”\nHe continued, “You see [Jay and Beyoncé’s] kids already have Grammys. They don’t sing yet. They don’t sing. They don’t rap yet. And, they already have Grammys and shit. So, they say, ‘Give them this trophy so we can secure that they’re coming — to the awards show.’ It meant that much to the culture they just gave them the things.”\nA post shared by Female Rap Blogger (@pinkworldstation)",

        "description": "New Orleans nativeBirdmanrecently began reminiscing about the start of Cash Money and the formation of Young Money. As such, during a recent appearance on theCannon’s Classpodcast with Nick Cannon, the Louisiana legend discussed the founding of Cash Money and detailed how its world-famous offshoot, Young Money, was formed.\nAfter its creation, Young Money (often styled YMCMB) was one of the most prominent hip-hop labels in the world for new, exciting rap talent. With Lil Wayne at the helm, Weezy became an A&R and was quintessential in spotting talent for the label.\nIn the late 2000s,the Cash Money imprint boasted the likes of Drake, Nicki Minaj,Lloyd, Tyga and many more. With so many high-calibre MCs, it makes sense that Cash Money would get a big budget for promotion. However, nobody knew how big it was until Birdman’s recent podcast appearance.\nWhile speaking with Nick Cannon, Birdman revealed the money he put into promotion, unveiling, “Two billion dollars between Drake, Nicki, and Wayne! Two plus billion dollars. Hundreds of millions of dollars, guaranteed.”\nThis isn’t the first time Birdman has insisted he poured vast amounts of money into acts such as Drake and Nicki Minaj while they were on the Young Money label. During a 2021 appearanceon theBig Factspodcastwith Big Bank & DJ Scream, Birdman stated, “When Universal gave me a bag, brother, I could honestly say I gave Wayne about $400 to $500 million, Drake got about $500 million, and Nicki got about $300, $400 million out of my pocket!” He continued, “No cap. If you don’t believe [me], ask them.”\nDespite Young Money’s iconic status, Lil Wayne and Birdman,the label’s two pillars, had a tumultuous relationship.By 2018, what was once a peaceful business relationship had turned ugly. This year marked the final year Weezy, Nicki Minaj, and Drake released albums under the Cash Money umbrella.\nThese days, Birdman is linked to other less-known Louisiana artists, such as his brother “Gangsta” Williams. But he is undeniably no longer in his business prime with music powerhouses under his label.",

        "description": "Sean ‘Diddy‘ Combs’ sex trafficking trial is set to begin next month. Ahead of the May 5th start date, his possible diminished mental capacity has become a significant part of the case.\nProsecutors filed a motion disputing any testimony that shows the Bad Boy rapper didn’t have the mental capacity to commit his alleged crimes due to the effects of drugs or alcohol. The motion, filed on April 27th, references a psychiatrist’s testimony on behalf of Combs and asks Judge Arun Subramanian to prevent his testimony during the trial.\n“The noticed testimony relates to the defendant’s diminished capacity to form the mens rea required to commit the charged offences – in other words, a ‘mental condition bearing on the issue of guilt,’” the government wrote in court documents.\nAccording toPeople, psychiatrist Dr. Elie Aoun’s testimony is redacted in the filing, but the prosecutors’ arguments hint that it suggests Combs’ “mental capacity” was affected by substances.\nProsecutors have objected to Aoun’s testimony, citing a rule that states, “If a defendant intends to introduce expert evidence relating to ‘a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant bearing on the issue of guilt,’ he must provide notice to the Government.”\nThe new filing claims the defence “disputed that Dr Aoun’s proffered opinions implicated” the rule in question.\nCombs is currently detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He’s facingcharges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force and transportation for purposes of prostitution following his arrest in September, and faces up to life in prison if found guilty.\nDiddy's claims of 'diminished' mental capacity take center stage days before sex trafficking trialhttps://t.co/2XGXnxd1LS",

        "description": "The US President has responded to a call for help fromSean ‘Diddy’ Combs, after the rap mogul sought a pardon from Donald Trump for trafficking, sexual assault and racketeering charges.\nTrump said he would “look at the facts” after a reporter asked whether he wouldpardon the rap mogul. The President acknowledged that he has not fully kept up with the trial and hasn’t seen or spoken to Combs in years.\nThe pair have a former report that Combs is eager to use to his advantage. Both public figures have expressed mutual admiration for each other over the years. Trump had previously been complimentary towards Combs while onThe Apprentice, and before Trump’s first presidency, Combs had been advocating for the businessman to take office. He claimed that the country under Barack Obama had “shortchanged” the Black community.\nThough Trump’s admission that he needs to re-engage with the trial shows he has not followed it closely, Trump’s son has discussed Combs’ trial in several previous interviews. Donald Trump Jr even took to his podcast the day before the election to spread a conspiracy theory linking celebrities who have endorsed Kamala Harris to the“freak off” parties hosted by Combs.\nAs the trial wrapped up its third week of testimony, Combs was denied a mistrial request by the Judge. The request was made over allegedly destroyed evidence. Los Angeles arson investigator, Lance Jimenez, who examinedKid Cudi’s car being set on firein 2011, revealed the destruction of fingerprint cards, with prosecutors suggesting that Combs played a role in the action.\nCombs has pleadednot guilty to all charges against himand faces up to life in prison if convicted of the alleged crimes.\nFor help, advice or more information regarding sexual harassment, assault and rape in the UK, visit theRape Crisis charity website.

Pusha and Malice collaborated for the first time in almost a decade on Kanye West’sJesus Is Kingalbum in 2019, with ‘Use This Gospel’ paving the way for their return.\nSpeaking on the new album, Pusha T toldVulture, “I think the album shows the supreme maturation of a rap duo. I think this is where you get the difference between taste and filler. This music is curated. This is a high-taste-level piece of work. You can only have that level of taste when you have the fundamentals down to a science. I think it’s been definitely missing. Then there’s the competitive aspect.”\nNo Malice added, “This is smart basketball. It’s fundamentals. And not only that, it’s authenticity. It’s what rap should look like if you’re real about your craft, real about your experience, real about your storytelling. It’s bringing the fans along to see the growth, not trying to fit in or fabricate.”\nConcluding, “It just seems like in other genres of music, they have the luxury of growing. For some reason, we act like we’re not supposed to evolve. This is what the true evolution of the Clipse looks like. It’s just good to be able to show that and still have high-level raps.”\nPusha released his last solo album,It’s Almost Dry, in 2022. The closing track, ‘I Pray for You’, featured Malice.",

While sleeping on the bottom of a bunk bed, she said she woke up in the middle of the night by “the weight of a person” above her.\nCrying in court, Mia said, “I remember it was sort of like him telling me, ‘Shhh.’ It happened so fast.” She described being terrified, confused, ashamed and scared, adding, “I just froze, I didn’t react.”\nWhen US Attorney Madison Smyser asked her if she wanted to have sex with Combs, she replied, “No. It was very quick. I don’t remember how it ended, but I remember he wouldn’t leave a job unfinished, so whenever he was satisfied is when it ended.”\nShealleged he sexually assaultedher on several occasions, telling the court, “Each time, I thought it was the last time, and if it happened again, I’d try to get out.”\nAnother time, Mia claimed Combs forced her to perform oral sex at his Los Angeles apartment while packing his bag on the floor of his closet.

DMX was previously featured on Lucas’ 2024 track, ‘I Didn’t Go’, which appeared on hisNot Now I’m Busyalbum.\nDMX raps in the new song, “I’ve been doing this for too long, plus dog is too strong/ Let you catch, fight me off the map with a new song/ You can bring out the best, or bring out the worst / You gonna bring out the worst, we gonna bring out the hearse.”\nHis last posthumous album,Exodus, was released in May 2021, the month after his death.

Can we make a new X album? For sure,” he said. “Will I make another X album? I don’t know. It has to feel good.”\nAdding, “[Exodus], he actually produced and had all of the direction. A lot of people wanted to see X go harder, stronger — they even blamed me for it. But it’s actually what he wanted to do. He was like, ‘Yo, I don’t wanna shoot up and kill everybody in a verse — that’s not what I’m doing.’”\nHe concluded, “And so this is why he refrained from doing a bunch of aggressive songs. It was just a different vibe. This is the music that X really listened to that people don’t know. They think he was just listening to ‘shoot ’em up, bang, bang’ music all day.”",

And for Puffy to be the only guy that gets on the stand is a sad day for hip-hop.\n“I don’t think this is a case where Puffy should be going to prison. How could every person who’s involved with Puffy not on the stand except for Puffy?

It might not seem like it when it’s all said and done, but I don’t think he has nothing to worry about, and I don’t think he’s worried because he’s gonna be federal, and if he gets convicted, Trump’s gonna pardon him.”\nConcluding, “I still feel that Puffy is going to be alright and have a fair shot at it. He’s not a not a dummy. And I’m quite sure somebody going to talk to those jurors and convince one or two of them. That’s all you need, is one.”",

Combs has been charged with racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for purposes of prostitution, and is currently on trial in Manhattan.\nCombs’ attorney, Alexandra Shapiro, moved for a mistrial over alleged destroyed evidence. Los Angeles arson investigator, Lance Jimenez, who examinedKid Cudi’s car being set on firein 2011, revealed the destruction of fingerprint cards, with prosecutors suggesting that Combs played a role in the action.\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian denied the request and told the court, “There was absolutely no testimony from the witness that was prejudicial in any way, shape or form.”\nJimenez claimed that fingerprint cards were destroyed in 2012 by the order of someone in the Los Angeles Police Department, to which prosecutors said, “Not you or anyone on your team?” Shapiro intervened, “I’m going to object to all of this. Can we have a sidebar?”\nShortly after, Shapiro said, “We are going to move for a mistrial at this time based on the prosecutorial misconduct that has occurred. Some prospective jurors said Mr Combs could buy his way out – this type of conspiracy is out there, and this bought into it.”\nShe continued, “They should have ended with when the fingerprint cards were destroyed. But they asked, ‘Did he authorise it?’ There’s no way to unring this bell. The only proper remedy here is a mistrial.”\nShapiro made these comments despite Subramanian stating, “My intent is to strike from the record any testimony about the fingerprint cards and the destruction of them. I will note that the only answers were what the witness knew about the destruction.

        "description": "Atlanta rapperQuez 2RR has been sentenced to over five years in prison for bringing a machine gun to a maternity ward. The 21-year-old (real name Terrell Searcy) possessed a stolen Glock 9mm handgun with a loaded 30-round extended magazine, capable of converting to a fully automatic weapon, in the labour and delivery unit of a hospital.\nSearcy pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a machine gun on March 21st and has now been sentenced to 66 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.\n“Holding people found in possession of machine guns and with illegal conversion devices accountable for breaking federal law remains a top priority in the Middle District of Georgia,” said Acting US Attorney C Shanelle Booker.\n“This case exemplifies how law enforcement and prosecutors work together to effectively remove illegal firearms and other dangerous destructive devices from the streets in order to make our communities safer.”\nThe incident occurred at Piedmont Walton Hospital in Monroe, Georgia, on August 17th, 2023. When a nursespotted Searcy with the gun, security came to the room. He admitted he had a handgun and had put it under a cushion on the couch, leading to police arresting him.\nThe firearm was tested and confirmed to function as a machine gun. In a song called ‘Traffic’, they also found Searcy rapping, “I pop out a switch on the back of my Glock” and “I put a switch on the back of my Glock, just to clean up the street when it’s time for that action.” The pistol and machine gun conversion also appear in the music video.\nATF Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Thomas Crawford of theAtlanta Field Division, added, “Machine gun conversion devices are fuelling a deadly uptick in gun violence, turning routine firearms into weapons of war. This case is yet another example of why ATF is committed to aggressively identifying and removing these illegal devices from our communities.”",

        "description": "Timbalandannounced the creation of a new AI-generated artist called TaTa last week. However, the response has been overwhelmingly negative.\nAfter news of Timbo’s new artist surfaced, many criticised him for choosing AI over talented humans and flooded his social media with opinions.\nIn an Instagram post, he wrote, “I know I’m trolling but let’s have real conversation. I love my independent artists. This doesn’t mean I’m not working with real artists anymore. And nah I don’t train ai off y’all music. This just means more creativity for creators.”\nProducer Shy FX took the comments tobash Timbaland for his business move, claiming he’s cashing in rather than pushing music forward.\n“You call it trolling, but the moves you are making are not jokes,” he said. “They are choices, and they come at the cost of real artists who are already fighting to be seen and heard.\n“You showed your colours when you attempted to make a song using Biggie’s AI generated voice. You made it even clearer by partnering with Suno, whose founder has been very vocal about wanting to replace musicians, not support them. And now this? This isn’t disruption. It’s a cash-in.”\nTimbaland also shared a video of music executive Ray Daniels praising his decision to launch an AI artist. In the clip, he says, “Why the fuck wouldn’t you?Mickey Mouseis an AI character. Donald Duck is an AI character. Bugs Bunny is an AI character. You guys are looking at it wrong.\n“He’s gonna make a character that he can have sing songs and sell products. That’s all these cartoonists and young kid TV shows are doing anyway, so why are y’all mad at him?”\nMusic journalist Rob Markman disagreed with Daniels’ point, saying, “Mickey Mouse was created by a human, drawn by a human, written by a human, voiced by a human… not the same.”\nA post shared by Timbo the King (@timbaland)",

The Long Beach rapper is a longtime fan of the Scottish football team and wants to expand the stadium’s culinary options.\nHe intends to combine his love of cooking and football to bring tasty burgers to Parkhead and even serve fans himself.\n“There has always been the opinion that food at sports stadiums is never good, but that ain’t got to be the case,” he told theSunday Mail. “People know that Snoop is a cook, and I would love to bring a pop-up burger to a sports stadium to show fans that food at stadiums can be good. It’s got to be Celtic Park, man. I mean, where else am I going to bring it?\n“The secret to a good burger is the love in the preparation. The ground beef has got to be mixed with some secret spices, then add a good quality cheese and some maple cured bacon. The Celtic fans are gonna love it, and to make sure they are just right, Snoop is going to be serving them himself.”\nHe added, “Am I going to bring my burgers to Rangers as well? Nah, I think we will give that a miss!”\nSnoop previously revealed his dream ofopening a restaurant with Gordon Ramsayin Scotland. “I have told him I want to open a restaurant with him, and maybe it might even be in Glasgow,” he said. “For real – we are always swapping cooking tips and I do mean swapping.\n“It’s not just one way traffic, I send him tips as well – he respects Snoop as chef. My boy Gordon has got a worse mouth than me but that’s only because of his passion.”\nLast year, Snoop said he was ready to invest in Celtic following Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s success as Wrexham owners.\n“I love what Ryan has done with Wrexham – it’s just a great story,” he said. “Investing in a sports team has been something I have been looking at for a long time – if the chance came to invest in Celtic, I would be crazy not to take a look at it. I have watched so muchsoccer in Europebut I have never seen fans like the Celtic fans. There is something so special about them.”\nHe added, “There is a reason why their fans are talked about across Europe – the best players and coaches in the world tell you there is nowhere like Celtic Park and I want to be a part of that. Their mascot is a hound – you couldn’t make that up. Snoop Dogg becomes Hoopy the Hound – that’s gotta be a match made in heaven. The headlines write themselves.”",

        "description": "Sean ‘Diddy‘ Combs has filed for a mistrial for a second time in his sex trafficking and racketeering case. The Bad Boy rapper’s team sent a letter to Judge Arun Subramanian on June 7th, claiming “prosecutorial misconduct” had occurred.\nHis attorneys claimed “the government has presented testimony that it knew or should have known was materially false related to its allegation that Mr Combs dangled Bryana Bongolan from the balcony of Cassie Ventura’s apartment in September 2016. Accordingly, to avoid an unfair conviction in this case the Court should grant a mistrial.”\nThey claimed that Cassie’s statement that she sawBongolan being dangled over the balconywas false because the singer allegedly found out about the incident through text messages.\nCalling her recount “demonstrably false,” they said, “The incident, as alleged, is disturbing and powerful evidence, and the government has used it to depict Mr Combs in an extremely negative light, as an angry and dangerous man who terrified Ms. Ventura and her friends.”\nCombs’ team also claimed photos of Bongolan’s injuries were taken on September 26th, 2016, in Los Angeles when the rapper was allegedly in New York City. They said the prosecution knew “or should have known that this testimony was perjured,” as “the government has long known” that information.\nIn addition, they said the prosecution “repeatedly attempted to disrupt” their line of questioning while attempting to “expose the perjury upon cross-examination.” They added, “All of this was highly improper and exacerbated the harm caused by the perjured testimony.”\nCombs, who isfacing charges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for purposes of prostitution, was previously denied a request for a mistrial on May 28th after it was suggested he might have something to do with evidence being destroyed concerning Kid Cudi’s car being set on fire in 2011.\nJudge Subramanian responded, “There was absolutely no testimony from the witness that was prejudicial in any way, shape or form.”\nFor help, advice or more information regarding sexual harassment, assault and rape in the UK, visit theRape Crisis charity website.

The woman who dated Combs between January 2021 and August 2024 was brought to tears while recalling sex sessions that would allegedly last for three days.\nJane Doe first met Combs on a girls’ trip to Miami in 2020 while he was romantically involved with one of her friends. Once they entered a relationship, she claims Combs pressured her into taking part in “hotel nights,” similar to the “freak-offs” Cassie described during her testimony, in which Combs arranged for her to have sex with other men.\nShe alleged that one of these nights involved three rounds of sexual intercourse with an escort over 18 hours. Afterwards, she said Combsleft the hotel, leaving her “lonely” and “so high” from ecstasy provided by the rapper.\nDoe claimed that multiple times, she told Combs she didn’t want to have sex with other men, but he dismissed her concerns. She alleged the longest “hotel night” lasted over three days without sleep, while the shortest was 12 hours. However, she said these typically lasted 24 to 30 hours.\nOn another occasion, she claimed she had sex with two male escorts without taking any drugs. Doe alleged she threw up in the bathroom afterwards, to which Combs told her, “You’ll feel better now that you’ve thrown up. Let’s go.”\nDoe stated that “hotel nights” became almost a weekly occurrence. In September 2023, she texted Combs, “I don’t want to play this role in your life anymore … it’s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusting.”\nCombs, who denies the charges, has been hit with charges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for purposes of prostitution.

Speaking toNPRin 2024, she revealed other high-profile requests.\n“Harvey Weinstein asked me to give him more hair as he walked by,” she recalled. “John Gotti asked me to take away his double chin.

The Virginia producer has announced a new AI entertainment called Stage Zero, which is set to be the home of many more personas that aren’t human.\nThe hip-hop figure, known for his work with Jay-Z, Missy Elliott and Justin Timberlake, co-founded Stage Zero alongside creative partner Zayd Portillo and film producer Rocky Mudaliar. They want their AI characters to become virtual influencers and star in movies and TV shows.\nMudaliar toldRolling Stone, ”Ultimately what Tim’s here to do is to pioneer a new genre of music — A-pop, artificial pop.” TaTa is set to release a debut single soon, supported by social media pages and music videos created with AI tools.\nTaTa’s music will be the work of both humans and the AI music platform, Suno. Timbaland uploads demos to Suno, then extrapolates them and inserts human-written lyrics. “It came to a point where I’m like, ‘Yo, this voice, it’s amazing,’” he said about TaTa.\nPortillo added, “We have these stacks of music that needed to be finished. And then it just so happened that the TaTa ones were just getting finished faster. There was just something about those songs that were just like. ‘Man, this just flows.’”\nTimbaland is no stranger to using AI and even made anAI-generated Biggie Smalls trackin 2023. Understandably, people have voiced their concern about creating music using AI, but the producer has stuck to his guns. He stated AI voice filters would “open up an unprecedented world of creativity in music” and hoped his startup would “usher in the new era.”\nSpeaking on the backlash against AI, Mudaliar said, ”It’s gonna be a bit of a battle, but it’s not going anywhere…. We were thinking about the example of the influencer itself and how ridiculous that might’ve sounded 10 years ago, where we’re like, ‘Nah, there’s no way YouTubers can be bigger than actors.’ And now they’re the biggest stars in the world.”",

However, her successful music career has also led to her starring in many movies and even earning an Oscar nomination.\nBlige was born Mary Jane Blige on January 11th, 1971 in the Bronx, and spent the early years of her childhood living in Georgia. Music runs in her family, with her father, Thomas, being a jazz musician, while she got her startsinging in a Pentecostal church. After moving back to New York and dropping out of school in Year 12, Blige explored a career in music after being inspired by the likes of Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and Chaka Khan.\nShe signed to Uptown Records as a backing vocalist at 18 beforeworking with Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who executive produced her first album. Blige released her debut albumWhat’s the 411?in 1992, going on to secure many number-one albums including 1997’sShare My World, 2003’sLove & Life, 2005’sThe Breakthroughand 2007’sGrowing Pains.

I was completely caught off guard and surprised by how much the critics and the audience loved this film. And the Oscar nominations were a big surprise.Mudboundwas challenging because I was going through so much in my life and was so insecure. And for the film, I had to peel back the things that were making me feel secure.”\nShe’s also appeared in movies such asI Can Do Bad All by Myself,Rock of Ages,Black Nativity,Champs,Sherlock Gnomes,Trolls World Tour,Body Cam,The Violent Heart,Pink Skies AheadandRespect.

        "title": "How hip-hop allowed Eminem to escape all of his childhood trauma",
        "description": "Eminemhas an interesting backstory, and his childhood has intrigued fans for years. When the Grammy-award-winning rapper first came to prominence, his anti-establishment, offensive, and angry demeanour fascinated people. As such, his life before fame has been of much interest to the culture.\nWhile trying to establish himself as an artist in Detroit, Eminem had a relatively conventional style of rapping, and the content of his music was nothing special, but this wasn’t him. Following the disastrous rollout and egregious critical reception of his debut albumInfinite, Eminem realised he was holding back and needed a vehicle to say what he honestly thought and felt he needed an alter-ego.\nOver the years, many saddening stories have come to light concerning the emcee’s upbringing and life before fame, whether domestic violence, poverty or other; the culmination came to fans in the form of Slim Shady.\nAlthough Eminem often touched on the trauma he went through living with his mother and the struggles he then had in hisdysfunctional relationship with Kim Scott.One chapter of his life he rarely speaks about is his social life, particularly in school.\nSlim Shady is an arrogant, rude, brash character, but Eminem was far from this during his years in high school, and many who have chronicled his life have found he was the victim of ghastly bullying in school and frequently dealt with being beaten up by his peers — much of it race-based.\nIn a 2011 interview with Anderson Cooper for the renowned show60 Minutes, Eminem opened up about his schooling and how it was a horrific experience for him. Unveiling how his mother’s drug addiction forced him into a predicament where he was living with different family members, bouncing between Michigan and Missouri, Em explained, “I would change schools two, three times a year, and that was probably the roughest part,” he said. “[I got] beat up in the bathroom, beat up in the hallways, shoved in the lockers, just, for the most part, being the new kid.”\nOne of Eminem’s bullies attacked him so violently that it resulted in the lyricist spending ten days in a coma in the hospital after a blunt-force blow to his head. The song ‘Brain Damage’ on his sophomore album,The Slim Shady LP, referenced one of his bullies and the real-life head trauma he faced.\nIn a 1999 interview withRolling Stonemagazine,the ‘Stan’ rhymervividly recalled the bully’s actions, recounting, “[He used to] beat the s*** out of me! I was in fourth grade, and he was in sixth. One time, he came running across the schoolyard and hit me so hard into this snowbank that I blacked out.”\nEminem’s uncle Ronnie Polkingharn introduced him to hip-hop music after playing him the 1984 Ice-T track ‘Reckless’. After this awakening, he quickly fell in love with what he heard and started absorbing the music of significant hip-hop artists like the Beastie Boys, Rakim, Masta Ace, LL Cool J, and NWA. The stories of Compton and the streets of Los Angeles enthralled him and made him forget, momentarily, about the problems he was having.\nHip-hop and its aggression gave Eminem a release for his anger and the stories told by other rappers allowed him to mentally escape from what he was dealing with at home and at school. It has long been suggested and even partially confirmed by Em that the repressed anger, humiliation and hatred he had for the world as a result of his experiences with bullies is what led to the birth of Slim Shady, but it was the genre of hip-hop that allowed him not only to escape but pushed him to express himself.",

        "title": "‘Yonkers’: The dumb song Tyler The Creator made as a joke",
        "description": "Tyler The Creatorhas produced many songs in his career, and theIGORcreator puts a lot of time and energy into making sure his songs have meaning, especially on his albums. However, one of his early songs was created as a joke.\nDespite the track initially being made as a joke, it has since become a fan favourite. ‘Yonkers’ appeared on Tyler The Creator’s sophomore album,Goblinand was released as the project’s second single. Released in 2011, while Tyler was still the frontman of hisLos Angeles collective Odd Future,Goblinwas released through the independent UK label XL Recordings.\nStill, he was just as experimental with his production in 2011 as he is now, and during a 2016 conversationwith fellow West Coastrapper Vince Staples on GOLF Radio, Tyler The Creator explained how the song wasn’t meant to be taken seriously. The rapper began, “N*ggas don’t know that that beat was made as a joke.”\nThe emcee then unveiled his true intentions, explaining to Staples, “I was trying to make a shitty New York beat, and we was just rapping like we was from New York like we were r*tarded,” adding, “And then, I just had some random verses, and I was just like, ‘I’ll just record it to this beat, this beat is kinda cool.’ And then n*ggas really liked it. That’s so nuts because that shit was actually a fucking joke. I made that beat in literally eight minutes.”\n‘Yonkers’ heard theCall Me If You Get Lostcreator rap about stabbing Bruno Mars, crashing BoB’s plane and saying “fuck” Hayley Williams. The explicit and edgy lyrics drew in a rowdy, young audience similar to that of Eminem, who was renowned for his explicit rhymes.\nDue to ‘Yonkers’ popularity, Tyler The Creator made what is now considered a classic music video. The self-directed visuals see him eating a cockroach and committing suicide at the end. However, during an interview withInterview Magazine, he revealed there was no deep meaning behind what was being shown on screen.\nOpening up about the video, Tyler explained, “A lot of people think that stuff is deeper than it really is. Some people just think too much. My manager knows I wanna be a video director, so he was like, ‘Hey, just write a video, write the treatment for it, and we’ll shoot it.’ So I was like, ‘All right, fuck it. I’ll eat a cockroach, I’ll throw up, and then I’ll hang myself.'”\nThe ‘Oldie’ rapper asserted that there were no subliminal messages or secret meanings. Instead, he merely made something he thought would look interesting. Emphasising this, he explained toInterview, “I just like doing shit that I think is cool, and people happen to like it, so I’m pretty fortunate for that,”\nHe added, “So I’m gonna just continue to be myself and do what I like. Again, people are just so quick to judge shit ’cause they don’t understand it. But I understand what I’m doing, and that’s all that should matter.”\nSince its release, ‘Yonkers’ has been streamed over 249million times and is still one of the emcee’s fan favourites.",

        "title": "How Mac Miller tricked Kendrick Lamar on to a feature",
        "description": "Mac Millercollaborated with Kendrick Lamar on a song from his 2016 albumThe Divine Feminine, but it almost didn’t happen. The pair teamed up on the Tae Beast and Aja Grant-produced ‘God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty’, which appeared as the closing track on the album.\n“I’ve always been waiting for the right moment and the right kind of song, ’cause everyone always gets Kendrick and they’re like, ‘I want him to rap well for a long amount of time,’ you know?” Mac toldGo 95.3. “That’s what everyone wants, but he does so much more than that. He’s brilliant. So, I wanted to get him on something different.”\nMac was working on the album in secret at the time. Kendrick FaceTimed him before coming to New York City, then, after performing onThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Mac got him in the studio and played ‘Dang!’ and another song produced by Metro Boomin. Kendrick was convinced by ‘Dang!’, but Mac really wanted to get him on ‘God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty‘.\nKendrick told him to email the beat, but Mac wanted his vocals there and then, so he had a trick up his sleeve. Because Kendrick required some radio drops, Mac let him into the booth to record what he needed. After letting him finish his recordings, Mac smartly played ‘God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty’ through his headphones, and Kendrick couldn’t help but record vocals over the instrumental.\n“He was literally walking out, heard the beat andgot right into creation mode,” he said. “So I kinda forced him to do it.” Mac knew that he himself couldn’t focus on a conversation when music was playing in the background, so he figured Kendrick would be the same. The rest is history.\nK.Dot sings on the chorus, “Hearts on my timeline/ Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold/ Don’t you know your body been mine?/ I know you know I know/ Sexy, nasty/ Have no guideline/ One day, four time/ You don’t mind that I don’t care/ Your divinity has turned me into a sinner God is fair/ And your beauty/ Can even make hell have a winter.”\nThis wasn’t the first time they collaborated on a record. In 2012, Mac collaborated with Kendrick on ‘Fight the Feeling‘, a song that appeared on hisMacadelicmixtape.\n“This one feels like a real moment like we were in the studio together, like we created something,” he told Zane Lowe about ‘God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty’. “All these artists have their own planets that they work on. You gotta create something new together for me. I don’t want to go do a song with Kendrick and make a Kendrick song.\n“What does our song like? It’s such a feeling and a journey that’s why I love that record. It goes so many places. It sounds like being in the ocean, relaxing, calm, floating and just like there and comfortable in your thoughts, and that’s how the record ends, which is so awesome.”\nHe added, “I’m so used to the record ending in death. It’s alway these depressing declines which is like the demise of myself. This album actually ends with comfort.”",

        "title": "Which rapper is the biggest box office draw in Hollywood?",
        "description": "To show versatility and improve their portfolios, rappers often venture outside ofhip-hop. Whether it’s fashion, media production, real estate, or tech, more and more rappers are venturing outside of music to see where they can display their skill sets and make money.\nOne of the most common ventures for an artist outside music, especially for rappers, is acting. Acting is often considered a relative of music. When we look more closely, we see that films require scores and soundtracks to emphasise various emotions further. In reverse, music requires videos (film) to help aid the communication of the track.\nThe two art forms are intertwined, so it is no wonder that the first step outside of rap for MCs is film. However, acting is not simple, and music artists cannot just walk onto a set thinking that they are in for an easy ride.Acting is a complex craftthat requires hours and, for professionals, years of honing your skills until you get every emotion down to a tee. The way you walk, talk, and even breathe can change the type of feelings you evoke. There have been countless films, including rappers, with some of the most famous actually doing exceptionally well concerning box office sales.\nFrom8 MiletoBarbershopandAbove The Rim,countless movies have featured rappers in leading roles, and some have become sensations. Still, many MCs take to acting more quickly and are more believable in their roles. While some hip-hop artists make mere cameos, others play characters with all their hearts and communicate their characters’ emotions.\nCharlie Ahearn’s 1983 movieWild Styleis often seen as the first feature film that embraced rap music. With appearances from the likes of Grandmaster Flash, Fab 5 Freddy, and the Cold Crush Brothers, although it didn’t exactly break any box office records, it was integral in bringing hip-hop culture into the mainstream.\nSince 1983, the culture has come leaps and bounds. In fact, it has progressed so much that, in 2025, we rappers have managed to transition from rapping to writing, directing, starring and even producinghigh-budget Hollywood films. Some have even pulled in over a billion dollars at the box office.\nWhether it’s Ice Cube, Queen Latifah, 50 Cent or LL Cool J, the sheer amount of money hip-hop artists have generated for Hollywood is staggering. However, there is one former rapper who sits on top of the rest concerning their box office draw.\nAs officially reported byThe Numbers,Will Smith has pulled in $9.54 billion in his acting career thus far. Whether it’sBad Boys, I Am Legend, Men In Blackori, Robot,Will Smith is by far the most successful rapper-turned-actor. Soon after his explosion onto the rap scene in the late 1980s alongside DJ Jazzy Jeff as The Fresh Prince, Smith found himself on TV screens across the US.\nWill Smith is primarily renowned for being an actor, but many elder figures in hip-hop also know him as a rapper. Although several of his records were overtly commercial and extremely radio-friendly, he still put out his fair share of music. From ‘Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It’ to ‘Summertime’, Smith and his discography undoubtedly have a place in the hip-hop history books.\nThe $9.54 billion he has earned at the box office began withBad Boysalongside Martin Lawrence, but his career snowballed after this, and things have never been the same.",

        "title": "‘Bagpipes From Baghdad’: The song that started Eminem’s spat with Nick Cannon",
        "description": "Eminemand Mariah Carey have had a long-standing feud over the years after Slim Shady claimed they were once romantically involved. The Detroit MC has rapped many lines about it, but it was ‘Bagpipes from Baghdad’ that got Nick Cannon riled up and caused issues between them.\nOn theDr Dre-produced trackfrom 2009’sRelapsealbum, Em spits, “Mariah, what’s ever happened to us? Why did we have to break up?” Later in the verse, he mentions Cannon by name, rapping, “Nick Cannon, better back the fuck/ Up, I’m not playin’, I want her back, you punk.” Cannon was married to Carey between 2008 and 2014 before finalising their divorce in 2016. The former couple have two kids together.\nCannonwasn’t happy with Em’s commentsand took to his blog to explain his issues. “A mediocre (at best) Eminem record that sounds like it was written in 2001,” he said. “At first, I thought it was old material that had been dug up from when dude ‘fantasised’ about having a pretend fling with Mariah. But all of a sudden I hear my name in the verse! My first reaction was like, ‘This is his new shit? Wow, that’s too bad.'”\nHe continued: “She has had enough difficulty in her life dealing with racial and ethnicity issues. Believe it or not, Mariah is the same racial mixture as our beloved president, Barack Obama. (Black Father + White Mother = BLACK). Maybe I’m going too far, but I thought we got past the days where white men could spew vulgar obscenities at our beautiful queens and get away with it.”\nHe added, “What’s next? Are we going to let this trash say something horrible about our lovely first lady, Mrs. Michelle Obama? Or would Marshall have talked sideways out of his neck like this about Oprah Winfrey? This act of racist bigotry cannot go unnoticed.”\nThroughout the rest of the song,Em has harsh words for them both, rapping, “Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin’ whore,” and, “I mean, I really want you bad, you c*nt/ Nick, you had your fun, I’ve come to kick you in your sack of junk.”\nAddressing those lines, Cannon said, “Calling my wife a ‘c*nt’ and a ‘whore’ is way worse than anything Don Imus could have ever said. So trust, repercussions will be served. Anybody got Al Sharpton’s number?! LOL Let’s not forget about Eminem’s amateur mixtape rants of calling African Americans ‘n*ggas’ and how he hates ‘black bitches.'”\nCarey denied that anything happened between her and Eminem in the song ‘Clown’ from 2002’sCharmbraceletalbum. “You should’ve never intimated we were lovers/ When you know very well we never even touched each other,” she sang.\nEm also rapped about Carey on ‘Superman’ fromThe Eminem Showand ‘Jimmy Crack Corn’ fromEminem Presents: The Re-Up. However, by 2010, he stated he was done talking about Carey in the public eye. “I really don’t want to talk about her anymore,” he toldVibe. “I don’t want to keep beating a dead horse. I’m not even going to comment about it. I’m done with that whole situation. I said what I had to say. I’m done.”",

        "title": "The single greatest rapper of all time, according to Jamie Foxx",
        "description": "Jamie Foxxis a man of many talents and is known in America as an entrepreneur, record producer, actor and singer. Although he isn’t loud and always in front of the cameras, he has contributed significantly to hip-hop and R&B.\nThe vocalist worked extensively with Kanye Westduring the 2000s and even appeared on his first two albums. BothCollege DropoutandLate Registrationwere global hits, and Foxx was privy to their creation. His work as a featured artist is interesting, he also had an impressive career as a solo musician and his sophomore project,Unpredictable,topped the Billboard 2000 in 2005.\nStill, it would be foolish to say he is just a singer because he began his career as an actor and is known primarily for his acting. His role in the beloved comedyIn Living Colourput him firmly on the Hollywood map,and he has grown as an actor ever since.\nThat said, the Grammy-award-winning entertainer recently starred in a movie alongside Cameron Diaz. The movieBack In Actionsees Foxx and Diaz play former CIA operatives in hiding who are trying to start a family.\nThe Netflix exclusive has been highly anticipated, and the two stars of the movie recently sat down for an episode of theComplexYouTube series ‘GOAT Talk’ during which they spoke about everything from comedians and directors to conspiracy theories and curse words.\nWhile speaking about their favourite conspiracy theories, Cameron Diaz opened up about one, unveiling, “The brief version of this is that aliens are basically like what we do when we study ourselves archaeologically. All the accounts of aliens are the same: big head, big eyes, no mouth, telepathic, and dextrous.”\nShe continued, “So if you think about where we are currently in technology, we’re sitting in front of screens, we don’t speak to each other, and we all know that we are moving off the planet because Elon Musk is our president. So we’re going to end up on Mars. So when we get to Mars, we’re really going to end up being a different species. We will have the technology all the aliens have when they come to visit us on this planet.” She concluded, “So those aliens are us travelling back in time to see who they were at any particular point that they have revealed themselves humans.”\nDuring the conversation, the two stars were asked to do their best impressions of another celebrity, and Foxx, in high spirits, attempted to mimic the unique voice of his “favourite rapper”Reasonable Doubt,creator Jay-Z. Speaking about his encounters with Jay-Z, Foxx said, “When I saw Jay-Z at a party he was like ‘Nice party!’” in his best Jay-Z voice.\nThe ‘Experiment’ singer continued, “Not a lot of people hear Jay-Z talk, but he barely gets it out and especially when he’s [talking about] his history, “‘Started off in Marcy projects. Because Dame had an idea he said ‘Do the music’ later on and then I met Bey.’”",

        "description": "Jay-Zand Beyoncé are arguably the most prominent celebrity couple in the world. Regarding talent, popularity, and net worth, few others come close to their influence as a duo over the past two decades and some change.\nThe rapper and singermet in 2000 at the MTV Spring Break Festivalin Cancún, Mexico, but didn’t start dating until the end of 2001. “We were friends first for a year and a half before we went on any date, on the phone for a year and a half, and that foundation is so important in a relationship,” Bey told Oprah Winfrey. “Just to have someone that you just like is so important and someone that is honest.”\nThe pair appeared on the cover ofVanity Fairin 2001. Then, the following year, they collaborated on ’03 Bonnie & Clyde’ fromThe Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse. In 2003, they teamed up once again on the hit single ‘Crazy in Love’, which reached number one on the Hot 100 and won ‘Best R&B Song’ and ‘Best Rap/Sung Collaboration’ at the Grammy Awards.\nJay and Bey married in 2008. Although details about the ceremony have been kept under wraps, it’s believed to have taken place at their penthouse in Manhattan. The couple has three children together: Blue Ivy, Sir, and Rumi.\nIn addition to their combined impact, the couple are also powerhouses on their own. Some of Jay’s biggest business ventures have included Roc-A-Fella Records, D’USSE Cognac, Rocawear, 40/40 Club, Roc Nation, TIDAL, Armand de Brignac, and Uber. As for Bey, she owns businesses such as Parkwood Entertainment, Ivy Park, Cécred, and SirDavis.\n“My brands are an extension of me,” Jay toldBest Life. “They’re close to me. It’s not like running GM, where there’s no emotional attachment. The clothes are an extension of me. The music is an extension of me. All my businesses are part of the culture, so I have to stay true to whatever I’m feeling at the time, whatever direction I’m heading in. And hopefully, everyone follows.”\nIn terms of music,Jay has released 13 solo albums, 11 of which have reached number one on the Billboard 200. He’s also dropped several collaborative albums and boasts four number-one singles on the Hot 100, including 2009’s ‘Empire State of Mind’.\nBey has eight solo albums following her time with Destiny’s Child, each of which went to number one. She boasts nine number-one singles of her own, most recently ‘Texas Hold ‘Em’ from her 2024 albumCowboy Carter. In 2018, Jay and Bey joined forces as The Carters for a collaborative album titledEverything Is Love, which debuted at number two with 123,000 units in its first week.\nWhile both artists are successful in their own right, only one person can come out on top in terms of net worth. According toForbes, Jay’s net worth stands at an incredible $2.5billion, while Bey is estimated to be worth $800million.\nIn 2021, Jay boasted a a music catalog worth $95million, along with $425million in investments, $320million in Armand de Brignac, $140million in Roc Nation, $120million in D’USSE. Bey’s art collection was also worth $70million and they together had $50 million in real estate.\nJay-Z became the first rapper to become a billionaire in 2019, with Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and Kanye West following in his footsteps.",

        "title": "How many guest verses has Eminem done in his entire career?",
        "description": "Eminemhas had what can only be described as a breathtaking journey in his career. From being homeless, working fast food jobs and battle-rapping in the grimiest parts of Detroit, the young man was quickly flung into fame and was soon a Diamond-certified artist.\nBefore hisSlim Shady LPrelease in late 1999, Em was a musical genius on the verge of suicide due to his extreme poverty. Em had been on the underground in Detroit for years with his first album,Infinite, performing poorly, receiving little to no airplay by DJs in his city, and as a white rapper, everybody had written him off.\nEm lived in the ‘8 Mile’ area of Detroit, meaning he lived near the road that divides Detroit. The 8-mile-long M102 motorway (colloquially referred to as ‘8 Mile’) is an infamous highway that is known for effectively segregating the metropolitan area of Detroit. Detroit’s inner city is rundown, and residents are primarily African-American. On the other side of the 8 Mile road, middle-class white neighbourhoods thrive. The road marks one of the steepest income divides in America.\nBefore his discovery by an Interscope intern at the 1997 LA Battle Rap Olympics, Em was effectively penniless. However, once his demo went into the hands of Dr Dre, things quickly changed, and within five years, he was one of the hottest MCs in the US and was appearing on tracks with the best rappers, such as Jay-Z, 50 Cent and many others.\nEminem once revealed how he approaches writing his guest verses in an interview withGenius,unveiling, “When I’m writing, I’m in the syllable game. I’m connecting five-six-seven-eight syllable phrases where every syllable rhymes. I get heavy into that. When I start rapping something, and I think of more syllables that connect with it, sometimes I want to just keep the scheme going forever.”\nElaborating on how he has done it on more than one song, the rapper continued, “I’ve done it before in songs, where the syllable scheme of the first verse ends up being the syllable scheme of the second verse, and the third verse — all the way down. I do it because the lines start connecting and making sense. Once I find something and lock in, it comes out pretty quick.”\nEminem only features on tracks with artists that he actually enjoys and respects and won’t hop on any song. Some of his best verses are on others’ tracks and he has appeared on various singles.  The ‘Stan’ rhymer has, of course, worked with multiple Aftermath acts, including Xzibit, 50 Cent, Dr Dre, and Kendrick Lamar.\nSome of his most well-known collaborations include the likes of Dr Dre’s ‘Forgot About Dre’, Nicki Minaj’s ‘Roman’s Revenge’ andJay-Z’s 2001 smash ‘Renegade.’ Eminem even produced the latter.However, few know the number of tracks Eminem has officially featured on.\nAs a featured artist on singles and tracks combined, theEncorecreator has recorded 172 guest verses. One of his most successful collaborations was with Rihanna in 2010 for ‘Love The Way You Lie,’ a diamond-selling single.",

        "description": "Many people consider New York the mecca of hip-hop, which has produced some of the biggest rappers in the genre. That competitiveness has led to people proclaiming themselves the ‘King of New York‘ over the years, but when it comes to sales, only one rapper can proudly claim that title.\nBusiness Insiderwrote a report in September 2024 that revealed the 16 rappers who have sold the most albums of all time. Much of the list was made up of rappers from New York, giving the East Coast the ultimate bragging rights.\nAt number seven on the list is LL Cool J with 12.5million album sales. The rapper from Long Island was one of the first to achieve mainstream success with his debut album,Radio, released in 1985. He has one number-one album to his name in 2000’sG.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time), with 2002’s10also peaking at number two. Platinum albums in his catalogue includeBigger and Better,Walking with a Panther,Mama Said Knock You Out,Mr SmithandPhenomenon.\nNext up, at number six, is Nas, also with 12.5million album sales. While he might not be the best-selling, many consider him to be one of the greatest rappers of all time, starting with his classic debut albumIllmaticin 1994. Despite the critical success of his first album,It Was Writtenremains Nas’ best-selling album, topping the Billboard 200 chart in 1996. He hasplenty of number onesto his name, includingI Am…,Hip Hop Is Dead,UntitledandLife Is Good.\nStepping up the numbers a little, DMX is positioned at number five with 14 million album sales. The Yonkers rapper, who died in 2021, boasts a stellar discography, with his first three albumsIt’s Dark and Hell Is Hot,Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Bloodand…And Then There Was Xselling a combined 12million copies.

His second album,The Massacre, also topped the chart and is six times platinum. It continued his success with hits like ‘Candy Shop’ and ‘Just a Lil’ Bit’.\nAt number three is Biggie Smalls with 21million album sales. The Notorious B.I.G. only released one album during his lifetime,Ready to Die, which is considered one of the best rap albums of all time. His second album,Life After Death, released 16 days after he was killed, sold 690,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.\nThe Beastie Boys are number two on the list with 23million album sales. Their debut album,Licensed to Ill, released in 1986, is one of the best-selling albums of all time and has achieved diamond status.

        "title": "The two rappers Mary J Blige respects the most￼",
        "description": "For the uninitiated,Mary J Bligeis the unofficial Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. The nickname was given to her by Andre Harrell: “Blige was living in a housing project in Yonkers, NY when the late Andre Harrell signed her to his Uptown Records, which released her 1992 debut album, What’s The 411? Harrell coined the nickname Queen of Hip-Hop Soul to describe the fresh way Blige’s music melded rap beats with R&B hooks.”\nWith a career spanning over three decades, Mary J Blige has seen hip-hop evolve firsthand, from the golden era of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls to the rise of today’s chart-dominating “mumble rap” sound. As the undisputed Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, the New York City native has been around long enough to witness the greats at their peak, making her well-equipped to weigh in on who stands tall in the game today.\nSpeaking to Manny Norte onCapital XTRA, Blige didn’t hesitate when asked which rappers she’s feeling right now. “I’m feeling Kendrick Lamar. I’m feeling Drake. They’re at the top of the list as far as rappers who should really be respected from the new generation… They’re killing it,” she declared.\nBlige’s praise for both artists came long before their ongoing lyrical warfare erupted, but it’s unlikely either of them took much notice—or cared. With their public back-and-forth reaching new heights in recent months, respect from a legend like Blige seems to have taken a backseat to their increasingly personal jabs.\nThe tension between Drake and Kendrick isn’t new. The two have spent the better part of a decade subtly (and not-so-subtly) jostling for the top spot in hip-hop. Their rivalry dates back to the early 2010s, when they collaborated on tracks like ‘Poetic Justice’ before veering into competition. Drake has long positioned himself as the commercial juggernaut of hip-hop, while Kendrick has solidified himself as the genre’s uncompromising lyricist and critic of the mainstream.\nBlige’s connection to both rappers runs deep. She worked with Kendrick onGood Kid, M.A.A.D City, appearing on the track‘Now or Never’, and stood alongside him during the 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show. Meanwhile, her history with Drake goes back even further. The Toronto superstar not only featured on her 2009 track ‘The One’ but also penned her 2011 song ‘Mr. Wrong’. He later paid homage by sampling ‘Mary’s Joint’ on ‘Weston Road Flows’ fromViewsin 2016.\nDid Blige’s mention of the two titans help fuel the fire that led to Kendrick’s venomous verse on ‘Like That’? Or are they simply two heavyweight rappers destined to be admired by legends and fans alike? As a lover of hip-hop’s ever-unfolding drama, I’m leaning toward the former.",

However, as we’ve witnessed with others in the scene when he had real listeners looking to see what he was about, his music career started to unravel quickly.\nWhen Richman first came to the forefront of the culture with his viral hit ‘Million Dollar Baby’, it was hard to deny that the track was catchy. The rhymer had been making music since 2019 and even had an independent album when he arrived.\nHowever, hip-hop culture was unsure of what he represented musically and knew little about him. Richman’s aesthetic presented him as a rapper, yet his platinum single was aDirty South singalong. As such, he was initially a confusing proposition. Still, the Virginia musician who was signed toBrent Faiyaz’s label ISO Supremacydidn’t want to be a one-hit wonder with nothing to offer. As such, in interviews, such as his chat with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, he promised fans that he would showcase his true talent to the world on his albumCoyote.\nDuring his Apple Music interview, he explained to Lowe that his entrance into the music scene wasn’t what he had planned, unveiling, “It’s really not how I imagined it. I really thought that I was gonna put out this album, and that’s how I was gonna blow up.”\n‘Million Dollar Baby’ was everywhere during this period, and people enjoyed the sound he had introduced them to with the single. Still, while the hit track was spreading like wildfire, Richman was in the studio working onCoyoteand expecting a massive boost to his career upon its release.\nIn hindsight, he may have been overconfident about his ability to make a body of work as, musically, he was in no man’s land. With no idea where he was going to make his mark, he releasedCoyoteto negative reviews, and the project only sold 3,400 copies in its first week. However, one incident significantly impacted the rollout of his album. In a moment of naivety, the fresh-faced artist tweeted, “I’m not a hip-hop artist.” Richman did this even though he had presented himself as a rapper for his entire career and also released ‘Million Dollar Baby’, which was very successful in the world of rap music.\nThis angered many, as it has happened previously with white artists.Post Malone entered the music industry as a rapper and switched to country music.The same can be said for Machine Gun Kelly, who entered the business as an emcee but decided to pursue rock after using rap for his fans. Still, in the case of Tommy Richman, many people saw it as a highly ungrateful thing to do since it was hip-hop and R&B radio stations that were promoting his music.\nDespite all of this, Tommy Richman’s situation is not unique nor unfamiliar to many who understand the basic principles of the music industry. Richman’s music was validated and promoted by TikTok, an app that utilizes short music clips. As such, it is unsurprising when acts such as Richman and Ice Spice come to the fore and reveal that beyond catchy 30-second snippets, their musical capability is low.\nAlthough technology may have advanced since the 1990s, unfortunately for people such as Tommy Richman, the basic tenets of the music industry haven’t. Only real musicians who build fanbases from the ground up achieve longevity in the industry, and whether it’s Ice Spice, the Island Boys, or Bhad Babie, success derived from social media is short-lived, and once the hype has died down, it will be hard to recover from the fall.",

        "title": "How Drake made J Cole change his sound out of fear",
        "description": "J Colewas partially disgraced last year after getting roped into Drake and Kendrick Lamar’s feud. The Fayetteville native was featured on the song ‘First Person Shooter’ with Drizzy in 2023, following the line “Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me? We the big three like,” Kendrick responded with a diss of his own.\nThe battle between Drake and Kendrick Lamar escalated quickly. However, due to his initialinvolvement in ‘First Person Shooter’,J Cole released his diss track entitled ‘7 Minute Drill’.\nHowever, during a performance at his annual festival, the Dreamiville Fest in Raleigh’s Dorothea Dix Park on April 7th, the ‘Wet Dreamz’ emcee told fans he was proud ofhis 2024 project,Might Delete Laterbut was ashamed of the song ‘7 Minute Drill’ and even apologised to Kendrick for it.\nWhile taking a break onstage, Cole explained to the crowd his feelings aboutMight Delete Later, stating, “I’m so proud of that project except for one part [but] there’s one part of that sh*t that makes me feel like, ‘Man, that’s the lamest sh*t I ever did in my f*cking life.'”\nDespite last year’s drama and craziness, before he even became famous, J Cole was aware of Drake. He stated that the Toronto native made him change his sound. In fact, Cole insinuated that before he heard Drake, he was planning on entering the industry by fusing R&B with hip-hop and wasn’t interested in anything conscious. During an episode ofInevitable,Cole recalled hearing Drizzy for the first time online, reflecting, “It was one dude in particular that I remember seeing on MySpace, and he was this light-skinned R&B-looking n*gga, but he had raps.”\nWhile speaking with Dreamvilee co-founder Ibrahim Hamad, Cole admitted that he loved Drake’s style but didn’t understand why he was so popular on MySpace, stating, “It was kind of neo-soul-type raps, like on some Little Brother sh*t, but he was talking about women or something. The n*gga’s whole demeanour was hella smooth. He continued, “His plays were through the roof for a n*gga you’ve never heard of or has never been signed! I was like, ‘Who is this n*gga?! How does he have 20,000 plays in a day?!”\nAlthough J Cole liked Drake’s music, he felt that theViewscreator was stepping on his toes, explaining,  “For so long, I felt confident in the fact that I was the only one occupying that space, the only one with that perspective and that sharp of a pen!”\nHe added, “I was like, ‘That’s gonna be my thing, that’s what’s gonna separate me from the pack. So the second I heard [‘Say What’s Real’], one, I was blown away because of how good it was. But two, subconsciously, I was like, ‘Ha! There was someone else out there the whole time that was working maybe just as hard as I was working, was thinking the same things, and who had the same opportunity to occupy a certain lane that I never saw any competition for.'”\n“My deal with Jay ain’t even done. I’m not even anybody yet. And this n*gga’s off to the races with hits, like cultural-shifting sh*t.’ At that moment, I had to shift my mindset about whatThe Warm Upwas about to be ’cause Drake just changed the game.”",

        "title": "The legendary beat 2Pac battled to get: “Slow, thuggish shit”",
        "description": "2Pacrapped in various styles, and it is fair to say that he was a versatile artist. From hardcore, aggressive gangsta rap beats and G-funk to slow, mellow backing tracks, theAll Eyez On Mecreator could bring soul and aggression to a song. That said, there was one simple yet legendary beat he wanted to use that caused a rupture between him and his crew, The Outlawz.\nFor his Makaveli album, the emcee wanted something a bit slower but still sinister. He tasked producer Hurt-M-Badd with producing it, and in less than an hour, he came up with what is now a classic— ‘Hail Mary’.\nDuring an interview, Outlawz member E.D.I recalled Shakur asking Hurt-M-Badd for a beat, remembering, “Pac told him, ‘I need some slow, thuggish shit.'” Still, the result was polarising. During a discussion withXXL,the beatmaker detailed how much the late legend loved the instrumental, recalling, “When I heard it, I didn’t think it was a hit. I was like, ‘Why is Tupac laying this stuff down over my track?'”\nBut 2Pac was a visionary. During a listening party, when everybody doubted the track and its entire vibe, the lyricist apparently “threw his hand up in the air with his Hennessy bottle [and] threw his hand up in the air like he ruled a nation.”\nDespite 2Pac’s love for the “slow” and “thuggish” instrumental that Hurt-M-Badd, his entourage of MCs (The Outlawz) had a deep hate for the song and initially didn’t even want to rap on it.\nWhile speaking to DJ Vlad, EDI explained, “I didn’t like the beat because it was more of a church beat, and, being from New York, we were used to that boom-bap head-knocking beat.” However, he admitted that once the audio engineer added some magic, it came to life, and confessed, “That changed when I heard the mix, though.”\nEDI vividly detailed the recording process of ‘Hail Mary’ and told DJ Vlad, “We just did the song in an hour and a half. It wasn’t my favourite record on Makaveli. It reminded me of some down-South record. I didn’t know it was going to be as big a record as it is today.”\nThe track has become a fan favourite, and although it wasn’t hugely popular when it was first released, it has become legendary over the years. Its introspective, spiritual nature saw a different side to 2Pac, who was known for his passionate, aggressive delivery.\n‘Hail Mary’was slower than a regular 2Pac beat and more gospel-inspiredthan anything he had previously released. Its understated bass, soft electric piano, and simple drum loop made it seem rather unremarkable. The song didn’t make waves commercially until it was re-released in 1998 as part ofthe legendary posthumousGreatest Hitsalbumas it captured the emotional nature of the late emcee and reflected the broader sentiment surrounding his death, which was one of sadness yet full of hope.\nThe lyrics and, more specifically, the chorus of ‘Hail Mary’ have gone on to take a line of their own, with the singing melody of 2Pac on the track being instantly recognisable to any fan of hip-hop.",

        "title": "The famous musician Jay-Z likened to Shakespeare and called “genius”",
        "description": "Jay-Zhas had a long and illustrious career and has collaborated with various artists from a range of genres, including rock. In 2004, he released a collaborative project with Linkin Park, but one rock artist he worked with, the Brooklyn icon, compared to the revered playwright and novelist William Shakespeare.\nOne musician who has strangely played an important role in Jay-Z’s career is Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. Martin has been a major player in the pop-rock scene ever since Coldplay dropped their first album,Parachutes, in 2000, featuring the unforgettable hit ‘Yellow.’\nAfter the turn of the millennium, Coldplay only got more popular and after release oftheir 2002 sophomore,A Rush of Blood to the Headtheir popularity skyrocketed with singles like ‘Clocks’ and ‘Speed of Sound’ turning them into mainstream legends. The band’s frontman and lead vocalist struck up such a weird but beautiful musical relationship with Jay-Z that during an interview with theMetronewspaper, Jay-Z called Martin a “genius.”\nWhile speaking about his ability to make fantastic music and craft hits out of nothing, as well as his stage presence, Hov insisted that in the future, Martin will be seen as a “modern-day Shakespeare.”\nHe then delved into how he knew he was dealing with a genius when he began seeing Martin create, stating, “We are good friends — but what I got to say has nothing to do with our friendship. I have been in the industry long enough to know when I’m in the presence of a genius, and Chris Martin is just that.”\nWhile speaking withMetro,he encouraged readers to see Coldplay live due to Martin’s excellence and heaped praise on him, explaining, “In years to come, Britain will look back at him as a modern-day Shakespeare. He is an incredible recording artist, an incredible songwriter, but where he really comes alive is performing live. If you get the chance to see Coldplay live, do it — you ain’t gonna regret it.”\nJay-Z and Chris Martin have collaborated on a number of occasions. Their first musical creation was ‘Beach Chair’, which appeared onHov’s 2006 projectKingdom Come.The two hitmakers also teamed up in 2008 for Coldplay’sProspekt’s’ MarchEP, where Jay-Z dropped a verse on ‘Lost+’.\nHis description of Martin wasn’t the only time Jay has reached for the word “genius.” During an interview withRolling Stone, the ‘Marcy Me’ rapper explained what the word means to him and insisted that it is reserved for musicians of the highest calibre. He has used the word previously to describe Kanye West, Dr Dre, Andre 3000, Bono and legendary Def Jam producer Rick Rubin.\nElaborating on his use of the word genius, Jay-Z toldRolling Stone,“For me, it’s coming up with something so different and so full of emotion and truth.” He continued, “Kanye – I think I was the first to brand him a genius. André 3000 does genius work. Bono, absolutely. Chris Martin’s a genius. Dr Dre, genius. Rick Rubin, super genius.”",

        "title": "The unique LA collective that Ice Cube once compared to The Pharcyde",
        "description": "Ice Cubeis a legend and was one of the earliest MCs to take over the West Coast. Still, over the years, he has proven to be more than just a rapper. The ‘You Can Do It’ rhymer has appeared in movies on television and has co-created and directed documentaries.\nIn 2020, the Crenshaw native became part of the West Coast supergroup Mount Westmore alongside old-school legends such as E-40, Too $hort and Snoop Dogg. However,although he is an emcee from the 1980s, the lyricist has always kept an eye on the current music scene in California. Odd Future particularly piqued Ice Cube’s interest, and he showed a lot of admiration for their extraordinary come up.\nOdd Future were a phenomenon when they first surfaced in the early 2010s. Formed in LA, the kooky collective exploded into the mainstream in 2011. The crew’s distinct look came with a previously unheard sound that took the culture by storm.\nOdd Future were pioneering in the way they effortlessly fused LA Skate culture with hip-hop and managed to created a cult following. Hip-hop and skate culture are entirely separate entities that would have seemed incompatible before. However, Odd Future seamlessly married them.\nThat said, during a sit-down conversation, Ice Cube once revealed something incredible. While discussing the state of LA rap, theLethal Injectionsurprisingly admitted that he was a fan of Odd Future founder Tyler The Creator and compared the collective to some extremely influentialWest Coast groups.\nSpeaking about the collective, Cube asserted, “That’s LA! That’s the LA people don’t know about — ultra-creative individuals who won’t conform to the culture of gangbanging. They’re going to be themselves.”\nHe then threw out some comparisons to 1990s California collectives, stating, “They remind me of, like, The Pharycde. Here’s another: The Black Eyed Peas come from here. You’re going to always have those groups who are going to stay down with their own style and their own flavour, and going to win with it.”\nTheFridayactor and creator continued, “Because they’re not conforming, they’re not being what you want them to be; they’re being who they are. And you gotta salute that.” Tyler The Creator and Ice Cube haven’t collaborated yet. However, there is a possibility for a musical partnership.\nThat said, so far, 2025 seems to be Kendrick Lamar’s year, and Ice Cube is no different.While speaking withBillboardabout the success of ‘Not Like Us’, the former NWA emcee heaped praise on Lamar, beginning, “As a hit, [the track] is humongous. As a diss, it’s top-notch. It’s one of the best disses that’s ever been done.\nHe continued, “Me and my homie Dub-C (WC) talked about it, when the battle first started — we were like, ’The first one who does the battle off a hit beat, it’s gonna be a knockout blow.’ It’s gonna cause a lot of damage. Because that’s what ‘No Vaseline’ is: It’s a hardcore diss, but it’s over hit music.”",

        "title": "The strange way Soulja Boy got his stage name",
        "description": "Since his breakout single ‘Crank That,’Soulja Boyhas become one of the most despised MCs in hip-hop. The Atlanta artist is known as a brash, arrogant and flashy character whose material does not match his ego. However, the emcee did have an undeniable impact on rap music.\nSongs such as‘Crank That,’ ‘Donk,’ and ‘Turn My Swag On’revolutionised hip-hop with dance-orientated lyrics and simple beats that made his rap style particularly appealing to young children. Produced by Soulja Boy, ‘Crank That’ with its famous “Superman” line, birthed a new hip-hop style reminiscent of Crunk, where the song had multiple calls to action that engaged audiences significantly.\nSoulja Boy was a product of the MySpace era and early YouTube age when songs such as ‘Chicken Noodle Soup’ by Young B and ‘Donk’ ran rampant around the internet. They appealed to a highly young demographic that wanted to have fun and learn dance moves instead of hearing gangsta rap.\nIn the 2000s, Soulja Boy was a big deal, and people were interested in his backstory. During a television interview with Bill Werde ofBillboard,the emcee spoke about the origins of his name and the kind of music he made before fame.\nWhen asked how he chose the name Soulja Boy, the ‘Turn My Swag On’ rhymer unveiled, “I got that name from my momma! My momma gave me that name when I was real little whenI was staying in Atlantaon Simpson Road, westside, and I just kept it with me.”\nThe lyricist continued, “When I started rappin’, I used ‘Dre,’ and after that, I changed it to Soulja Boy.” The rapper then told a story about a song he made under the moniker, telling Werde, “It’s funny ’cause the first song I made [as] Soulja Boy, it was called ‘Ready For War’,  my momma actually gave me the beat for it!”\nAccording to the emcee his mother knew a producer in the city who gave him that beat. However, when he first broke onto the scene he didn’t make use of those contacts as ‘Crank Dat’ was made by him on production software Fruity Loops.\nIn an interview, he explained, “To be honest, it took me an hour to produce the ‘Crank That’ song – at the most.” He continued, “Sometimes I just sit back… I can make a beat in my hotel room, or I can make a beat in my dressing room while getting ready for a show, and I can send it to Pro Tools, and bam, get it right back recorded on my laptop. Then I can post it for all my fans to hear.”\nAlthough Soulja Boy is a household name, he is most definitely an artist who is associated with the past and a bygone era. Akin to many artists from the mid-2000s, his brand was so tightly linked to the surge of crunk that once the hype fizzled out and the movement ended, so too did his career in many ways. However, he still wreaks havoc on the internet on a regular basis.",

        "title": "Who is the richest female rapper in the world?",
        "description": "Female rappershave been dominating the mainstream over the past decade. Artists such as MC Lyte, Foxy Brown, Lauryn Hill, Lil ‘Kim and Ladybug Mecca laid the blueprint for women to thrive in hip-hop today.\nThat success has also translated into impressive net worths, competing with male rappers on the rich scale. Earlier this year,CEO Todaycompiled a list of the 11 richest female rappers on the planet.\nAt number 11 on the list is Doja Cat, with a net worth of £12million. The Los Angeles artist has been everywhere over the last few years, flooding the charts with hits such as ‘Say So’, ‘Paint the Town Red’, ‘Woman’ and ‘Agora Hills’. If she continues her trajectory, she’ll climb up the rankings in no time.\nSalt from Salt-N-Pepajust about makes it into the top ten with £14million, with Pepa just in front of her in ninth with £15 million. The rap trio are one of hip-hop’s most influential female acts, releasing their debut album,Hot, Cool & Vicious, in 1986. It sold over a million copies in America, making it the first female rap LP certified gold and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\nFurther down the list is Australian export Iggy Azalea, whose £15million net worth positions her as the eighth richest female rapper. Bhad Bhabie, who initially found fame through her “Cash Me Outside” meme from her appearance onDr. Phil, is at number seven with a £25million net worth. In addition to music sales, OnlyFans content and brand endorsements have earned her millions.\nWith a net worth of £30million, Megan Thee Stallion occupies the sixth spot. The Houston rapper has been one of themost prominent female artistsover the years, producing hit singles like ‘Hot Girl Summer’, ‘Savage’ and ‘Hiss’. Just above her is Lizzo, with a net worth of £40million, who seamlessly blurs the lines between singing and rapping.\nRepresenting the ’90s and ’00s generations strong is Missy Elliott in the fourth spot with a £70million net worth, following Queen Latifah at number three with £70million. Both artists are trailblazers who undoubtedly inspired many others on the wealthy list.\nCardi B comes in at number two with a net worth of $80million. The Bronx rapper is known forspeaking what’s on her mindand delivering some of the biggest tracks from female artists over the past decade. While she’s only dropped one album,Invasion of Privacy, in 2018, Cardi has provided constant hits such as ‘Bodak Yellow’, ‘I Like It’, ‘Please Me’, ‘WAP’ and ‘Up’ to name a few.\nNicki Minaj is the wealthiest rapper with a $150million net worth. Often referred to as the Queen of Rap, the Queens native has remained one of the biggest rappers in the world since the start of the 2010s. Known for her flow and alter egos, Nicki has switched between huge pop records and trading verses with the best lyricists, which is something she does best.\nShe once claimed that other female rappers don’t understand her and revealed what she’d like to hear more of from women in hip-hop. “I don’t think the new female rappers really understand who I am,” she toldInterview Magazine. “A lot of the girls that came before me, they really were those sexual beings, and I was so inspired by them. But I’m not like that, I’m more the goofy girl.”\nShe continued, “I wish there was some more singing. I remember listening to Monica’s first album, for instance, and I couldn’t put it down. Or, of course,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Now, what happened was that we introduced this guy who was a really great rapper, but he has great melodies, and his name is Drake.”",

        "title": "The moment Jay-Z left the streets behind: “This life has no good ending”",
        "description": "Before becoming a billionaire and one of the greatest rappers of all time,Jay-Zsold drugs around the Marcy Projects. He started selling drugs at the age of 13 after the crack epidemic took hold in the 1980s. After his father left when he was 11, Jay found his place in the streets, looking up to dealers in his local neighbourhood.\nHowever, after experiencing multiple deaths and incarcerations, Hov realised he needed to find a way out. “I started seeing people go to jail and get killed, and the light slowly came on,” he told Oprah Winfrey. “I was like, ‘This life has no good ending.'”\nJay was in his early adulthood when he came to this realisation. He split his time between drug dealing and rapping,becoming known as Jazzy, selling records out of his car. Hova gained a loyal following before launching his label, Roc-A-Fella Records, in 1996.\nHe was around 20 years old when he decided that he needed to quit the streets to pursue a thriving music career. “I’d been trying to transition from the streets to the music business, but I would make demos and then quit for six months,” he said toO Magazine. “And I started to realise that I couldn’t be successful until I let the street life go.”\nJay took advice from his mother in putting an end to selling drugs, believing he had to put his all into making a career out of music. It was a considerable risk but one worth taking.\n“My mom always taught me—you know, little boys listen to their mums too much—that whatever you put into something is what you’re going to get out of it,” he recalled. “I had to fully let go of what I was doing before for the music to be successful. That was a leap of faith for me. I said, ‘I have to give this everything.'”\nEverything Jay experienced up until age 26 was put into his debut album,Reasonable Doubt, which was released in June 1996. It’s his favourite project of his career because it presented his life struggles until that point, allowing him to pour his heart and soul into it when he wasn’t the success story he is today.\n“That first album,Reasonable Doubt,is my favourite because all the emotions and experiences of 26 years came out in it,” he said. “That was the record I had 26 years to make.”\nHov sold drugs as a way to survive in Brooklyn and learned how to manage money along the way. “I know about budgets. I was a drug dealer,” he toldVanity Fair. “To be in a drug deal, you need to know what you can spend, what you need to re-up.”\nWhen asked if he regrets dealing drugs, he said, “Not until later, when I realised the effects on the community. I started looking at the community on the whole, but in the beginning, no. I was thinking about surviving. I was thinking about improving my situation. I was thinking about buying clothes.”",

        "title": "The reality star who says 50 Cent used her in his feud with Rick Ross",
        "description": "50 Centand Rick Ross’ feud has mainly consisted of diss tracks and social media taunts. Over the years, the pair have exchanged numerous words online. However, concerning 50 Cent, it has always seemed to be an exercise of humour and done in jest without nefarious intent. That said, on the surface, it appeared that none of their careers were damaged permanently by their feud.\nHowever,the feud didn’t just involve the two MCs,and one jab 50 Cent took at Ross indirectly involved his then-girlfriend, Lastonia Leviston. During the height of their battle, theGet Rich Or Die Tryin’creator allegedly bought and released a sex tape of Leviston, which had serious repercussions for her and her mental health over the long term.\nLeviston met Rick Ross in the 1990s, and the two began dating in 1999. The two even had a daughter, Toie, but they split in 2003. According to Leviston, she and thePort Of Miamicreator had a relationship like two greats, once saying she was “his Lil Kim and he was my Biggie.”\nDuring an episode of the new Netflix seriesW.A.G.s to Riches, Leviston unveiled that her ex-boyfriend, Maurice Murray, whom she dated after splitting from Rick Ross, was “into videotaping” and was the reason her infamous sex tape was made public.\nAccording to Leviston, during50 Cent and Rick Ross’s feud,Murray saw an opportunity to make some money from the tape and claimed that Fifty used her and the tape to publicly embarrass Rick Ross and the mother of his child.\nDuring a segment of theW.A.G.s to RichesNetflix reality show, Ross’ ex-girlfriend explained, “Long story short, my ex, the guy that was in the sex tape, he’s bitter. So he actually goes and sells the tape to 50 Cent. And then 50 Cent released it. It’s petty, and it still haunts me to this day.”\nShe asserted that theGet Rich Or Die Tryin’creator used her and was happy for her to be “collateral damage” in his battle with Rozay. However, Fifty’s decision to release the tape had a long-lasting effect on Leviston. In fact, Leviston has previously claimed it made her suicidal, stating, “In that second, my whole life changed.” She continued, “I became suicidal. Didn’t want to live anymore. I felt like I was damaged goods. [I felt] like no man would ever love me again. I felt like I had let my kids down tremendously.”\nFollowing the release of the sex tape, Leviston filed a lawsuit against 50 Cent, and a jury ruled in her favour, meaning Fifty was forced to pay her $5 million. Leviston has since been able to make peace with Rick Ross. However, she still feels that people continue to judge her based on her past.\nIt is undeniable that 50 Cent used the reality TV star in order to hurt Rick Ross. However, he was able to pay his way out of the trouble the courts put him in with their fine. Leviston currently features onW.A.G.s to Richesalongside the ex-fiancée of NFL player Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, the former love interest of rapper Kodak Black, the wife of Miami Dolphins player Philip Wheeler, and the wife of retired boxer Andre Berto.",

The Detroit rapper has iconic albums to his name, such asAt the Speed of Life,40 Dayz & 40 NightzandRestless, which Public Enemy directly inspired.\nChuck D and Flavor Flav’s third album,Fear of a Black Planet, became pivotal in Xzibit’s understanding of hip-hop music and what he wanted to channel into his music. For him, he relished the ambitiousness of the songs and how important they were at the time, making it a perfect album.\n“Public Enemy is my favourite rap group of all time, soFear of a Black Planet, when it came out, I was really just a fan of hip-hop,” he toldPitchfork. “I hadn’t even thought about becoming an artist yet. I don’t remember exactly where I was in the scheme of things, but I know was young, I was still in school.\n“So I was walking around school in my Sony Walkman, walking around the hallways feeling like, ‘This is my theme music.’ So, I can remember specifically how this music made me feel. But when you play that record, especially ‘Brothers Gonna Work It Out’, ‘Fight the Power‘, ‘911 Is a Joke’ – these were really different sounding songs and they were very powerful in the climate.”\nHe added, “Public Enemy have always been a Rage Against the Machine-esque hip-hop group for me. And so, that’s why I feel like, from top to bottom, that album represents a sound and an era in hip-hop that has yet to be eclipsed.”\nProduced by The Bomb Squad,Fear of a Black Planetwas released on Def Jam in April 1990, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard 200 and four on the UK Albums Chart. It’s often considered one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.\nXzibit explained how Chuck D’s original vocals inspired him to use his “gruff and rough” voice as an instrument in his songs. Specifically, ‘Fight the Power’, a song about fighting the abuse of power, was a standout track for him on the album, which famously appeared inSpike Lee’sDo the Right Thing.\n“My favourite track offFear of a Black Planetwas ‘Fight the Power’, simply because it was an anthem and the production on Public Enemy was always so interesting to me,” he said. “It was very busy; it had many, many layers, and I would just remember listening to these songs over and over and over and finding so much that I had missed before, and I knew these records by heart. When something connects and touches your soul like that, you just never forget.”\nThe formerPimp My Ridehost continued, “I don’t even think it’s about the particular song, I think it’s the way the production transitions into every other song as it came in. Flavor Flav, Chuck D, The Bomb Squad – their chemistry together provided an environment that was really interesting to me. And I, fast forward as an artist, have developed and put that sound into my music as well.”\nA post shared by Pitchfork (@pitchfork)",

        "description": "Musicians will always write about their life experiences, both good and bad. However, it’s impossible to know whether a breakup song will come back to haunt them. This was the case forBig Seanand his hit single ‘I Don’t Fuck with U’ (also known as ‘IDFWU’), which was released in 2014.\nThe Detroit rapper started dating actress Naya Rivera in 2013, getting engaged that year before ending their relationship in 2014. TheGleestar then married Ryan Dorsey on July 19th of that year, the original date for her and Sean’s wedding.\n‘I Don’t Fuck with U’ was released that September and speculated to be about Rivera. He raps in theDark Sky Paradisesong, “I don’t fuck with you/ You lil’ stupid-ass bitch, I ain’t fuckin’ with you/ You lil’, you lil’ dumb-ass bitch, I ain’t fuckin’ with you/ I got a million trillion things I’d rather fuckin’ do/ Than to be fuckin’ with you, lil’ stupid ass.”\nThe track is nine times platinum and one of Sean’s most popular records, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. These days, the song is a touchy subject. Rivera died in July 2020 after drowning at Lake Piru near Santa Clarita, California, while on a boat with her four-year-old son, who she saved.\nWhen asked if the song was about Rivera, he toldVulture, “That’s a tough question to answer because I’m still processing a lot of that,” he said. “I don’t feel comfortable talking about it because I want to respect her. She’s made such an impact on people, and she’s done so many great things in her life and her career that it was hurtful to even have that [song] be associated with her.”\nDespite their breakup, Sean revealed that Rivera was a fan of ‘IDFWU‘. He also admitted that he wouldn’t have recorded it had he foreseen the tragic incident.\n“It wasn’t a diss to her,” he explained. “I truly made the song and played it for her. She knew about it, and she liked it. We had a breakup that was very public, and we were young and we forgave each other and moved on from that. If I would have known something this tragic would have happened, I would have never made the song.”\nSean paid tribute to Rivera following her death, posting photos on his Instagram alongside a moving caption.\n“Rest in peace Naya, God bless your soul! Thank you for blessing us allwith your talentand presence,” he wrote. “You are a hero! Not just because of how you saved your son, also because of the barriers you knocked down for so many people to make them feel confident in themselves and to stand tall and be proud when they couldn’t achieve that on their own.”\nHe continued, “I appreciate and cherish everything that ever happened between us for making me wiser and a better person. I’m still grieving and in shock, I can’t believe this is real. I’m praying for you and your family and I know your watching over them and protecting them. Rest In peace Naya.”",

        "title": "The one rule Jay-Z has for studio sessions: “He was dead serious about it”",
        "description": "Jay-Zcares a lot about his craft. When it comes to working in the studio, Hov has strict rules that collaborators also need to abide by. The Brooklyn artist takes pride in his ability as a lyricist, and he made sure Louisville rapper EST Gee was also on the same wavelength before getting in the recording booth together.\nThe 30-year-old, signed to Yo Gotti’s CMG label, once opened up about having phone calls with Jay-Z and touched on his comedic nature. Before linking up in person, Gee revealed that Jay told him not to bring a ghostwriter to the studio. While he was joking about Gee having someone write for him, the actual guideline was legit.\n“Jay-Z a street n*gga, he just got a billion,” he toldComplex. “He just on some cool shit, but he ain’t on no weird shit. Jay-Z ain’t weird at all. And I’ve done met some rappers who be weird bruh, and they supposed to be more younger, gangsta, whatever. You know, Jay-Z kinda old, he been in rap for a long time and he ain’t weird. He’s a regular n*gga, you feel me?\n“He gon’ shoot a joke at you and everything. He told me, ‘Let me bring you down tothe Super Bowlwith me so we can kick it, man.’ He’s like, ‘We get in the studio, make sure you don’t bring your ghostwriter with you.’ I’m like, ‘Damn.’ He’s like, ‘Yeah man, they told you have somebody write that shit for you.’ He was dead serious about it. That’s how I know he’s a street n*gga who made it down to the big level.”\nDespite Jay-Z being against ghostwriters, Consequence once claimed he wrote 2003’s ‘Encore’. “One record in particular I was happy about to be a part of was Jay-Z’s ‘Encore’,” he toldPower 106. “When me and Kanye was on the phone and we actually kinda came up with the chorus back and forth.”\nGee previously discussed what it was like to meet Jay-Z, claiming they think in similar ways. “It was something, but shit, I don’t know. It was regular,” he toldBillboard. “It’s enough for us and them. Make sure your people are straight. You just gotta remember who you are. I respected it, he’s a street n*gga. He’s got a billion dollars. I can tell he don’t even think about it like that, ‘Man, I’m Jay-Z.’”\nHe continued, “He just be like, ‘I can’t believe they let me do it like that.’ That’s how I think, ‘How they let me get right here?’ A lot of shit be going on but it be whatever. It’s nothing they could do. It’s gone so far and you gotta know where I’m from. N*ggas trade everything for this shit. I know they watch my Instagram like, ‘What the fuck?’ I know it bothers n*ggas, and there’s hate with the love.”\nGee carried his experience with Jay into his debut album,I Never Felt Nun, which was released in 2022 and peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200. Itfeatured Jeezy, Future, Jack Harlow, Machine Gun Kelly and Bryson Tiller.",

        "description": "Compton emcee,The Game, was one of the only West Coast artists signed to Aftermath Records during the early 2000s. The lyricist’s path to fame was a strange one, but in 2003, following the success of both Eminem and 50 Cent, the rhymer  became Dr Dre’s primary protégé.\nDr Dre had caught wind of the West Coast artist through his brother, Warren G, who had heardQB.2.Compton,which was exploding on the LA underground. Following the establishment of both 50 Cent and Eminem as credible artists, The Game becameDr Dre’s protégé and even joined G-unit.\nHowever, before his rapid rise to fame, The Game nearly died in Compton after a deadly shooting that left him in a deep coma. The incident was what sparked theDoctor’s Advocatecreator to begin music in the first place, but he may not have had the career he did had he passed.\nThe ‘Dreams’ rhymer was shot five times in his apartment due to a drug game beef. The blood loss and a bullet in his back sent him into a three-week coma, andtheDrillmaticcreatorwas rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in LA.\nIn a 2023 interview with  DJ Vlad, The Game recalled the lead-up to his shooting, detailing, “[After a knock on the door] I look through the peephole, and it was this corny ass square n***a that always comes through.”\nThe Compton emcee continued, “He gets some trees and a little something else, and then he dips, so when I look through the door, all I could see was him. So I’m like, ‘I’ll serve this n***a, and then I’mma kill it after this.”\nHe concluded, “But let me make this little 20, 30, 40, maybe 50 if he wants an eight ball or something like that.’ So I opened the door, and as soon as I opened the door, two other n***as came behind him with guns drawn, and it sort of like blew me back off the door.”\nIn a since-deleted 2019 Instagram post, The Game detailed his shooting, writing, “OCTOBER 1ST 2001 ‼️ 18 years since I was in a coma after getting shot 5 times in the dope spot… I look at this video of the younger me & I can’t do anything but thank God for the opportunity to have a second chance,”\nThe Game captioned another video of him as a teenager, posting, “I’m tellin’ y’all, I was a real fuck up… I never expected nor cared to live past 25 years old. I literally didn’t give a fuck !!!! Sometimes I do not know how I made it out of all I’ve been through… but, I did… & I guess that’s the only important part of my story at this point in life. I’m here.”\nFollowing the release ofThe Documentary,the icon addressed the track ‘Dreams’ when he rapped “Woke up out that coma 2001”, stating, “It was like waking up from anything. I don’t know what dying’s like, but I know you just go to sleep, and you never wake up. And if it’s anything how that little short-lived coma was, then it’s not really nothing no one can deal with. And really, your ass can’t do shit about it.”",

        "description": "Jay-Zreleased his4:44album in 2017, two decades after his debut album. He’s come a long way since 1996, and his last project is one of the most confessional of his career; it almost felt like a therapy session. That personal aspect might not have been achieved if Hov hadn’t attended therapy and benefitted from the experience.\nJay first contacted a therapist through the recommendation of friends who had “been through a lot” and “come out on the other side as whole individuals.” Something he learned during their sessions is the connection between every emotion and the importance of acknowledging all of those feelings.\n“I grew so much from the experience,” he toldThe New York Times. “But I think the most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a … you’re at such an advantage.”\nHe was able to use those conversations to make sense of racism and bullying, bringing up examples of fights when he wasgrowing up in the Marcy Projectsin Brooklyn.\n“You know, you realise that if someone’s racist toward you, it ain’t about you. It’s about their upbringing and what happened to them, and how that led them to this point,” he said. “You know, most bullies bully. It just happen. Oh, you got bullied as a kid, so you trying to bully me. I understand. And once I understand that, instead of reacting to that with anger, I can provide a softer landing and maybe, ‘Aw, man, is you OK?’\n“I was just saying there wasa lot of fightsin our neighbourhood that started with, ‘What you looking at? Why you looking at me? You looking at me?’ And then you realise: ‘Oh, you think I see you. You’re in this space where you’re hurting, and you think I see you, so you don’t want me to look at you. And you don’t want me to see you.'”\nJay added, “You don’t want me to see your pain. You don’t … So you put on this shell of this tough person that’s really willing to fight me and possibly kill me ’cause I looked at you. You know what I’m saying, like, so … Knowing that and understanding that changes life completely.”\n4:44was released in June 2017 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 262,000 units. No ID produced the entire album, including memorable tracks like ‘The Story of OJ’ and ‘Family Feud’. Tough topics on the LP include cheating on his wife, Beyoncé, and revealing that his mother was a closeted lesbian.\n“That’s who I am,” he said about telling his life story. “And I’ve done it from the beginning of my career. Two things: one, no one knew the characters [back then]. So it wasn’t as impactful. And two, it wasn’t coming from a place where it was as evolved. And it’s very difficult. It’s hard to hear songs back. It’s hard to perform … songs, but, um, I feel it’s the most important work that I’ve done.”",

        "description": "A$AP Rockyhas remained true to himself since he broke onto the scene in the early 2010s. Passionate about fashion just as much as music, the Harlem rapper has never been afraid to wear feminine clothing or paint his nails, which the hip-hop landscape has slowly acclimatised to over the years.\nDuring a 2013 interview, Rocky explained that he included the American flag on the cover of hisLive. Love. ASAPmixtape andLong. Live. ASAPalbum as a representation of being misunderstood.\n“That’s a political view,” he toldRolling Stone. “Society lives by rules and laws that are man-made, but anything man-made can be broken. When you break rules, sometimes it’s justified for the penalty. And there are always certain forces that are trying to restrict you. We’re all misunderstood, and the flag represents that. We’re trying to represent for the wars that our generation faces. I want us to all be united. It’s bigger than music, straight up.”\nRocky revealed that he felt misunderstood about his art and fashion sense. People believed he should look or sound a certain way from Harlem, New York City.\n“I feel misunderstood about my art. I feel misunderstood about my fashion. Let’s start there,” he said. “I wore a long shirt in the ‘Fuckin’ Problem‘ video, and people were saying that I wore dresses. Then there’s my image: the gold teeth and the braids. People say he’s from Harlem, but he looks like he from Houston, or he looks like he’s from Cleveland, or from Cali.”\nSpeaking toLife+Timeson another occasion, Rocky admitted he was done with people’s misconceptions about him. Instead of giving them the time of day, he ignored the haters and continued doing what felt organic.\n“I don’t know what to think anymore,” he said. “Motherfuckers gonna say what they gonna say at this point. It’s too late for that now, we’re in the masses. I was going down the street and I saw a big ass billboard! If I keep worrying about what motherfuckers say I’d be fucked up.”\nHe continued, “I just did a song where I was like, ‘Motherfuckers accuse us of being f*ggots,’ and I used the F word. A few people was like, ‘Maybe people will take it wrong?’ We all thought about it and said, ‘Fuck it!’ I know what I meant, and it is what it is. People are gonna say what they’re gonna say. I plan on not giving a fuck at this point.”\nRocky has had another reason for people to have something against him in recent years after he was accused of shooting his former friend. However, he wasacquitted of two felony counts of assaultwith a semiautomatic firearm, and he’s been determined to rebuild his image since being found not guilty.\n“Thank y’all for saving my life,” he said to the jurors in court before telling reporters outside the building, “This whole experience has been crazy for the past four years. I’m thankful, and it’s blessed to be here right now, to be a free man talking to y’all.”",

        "description": "Drakehas had some iconic feuds in his career, from Kanye West to Pusha T. One of his most nail-biting battles was with Meek Mill. In 2015, tensions between the two arose when the latter accused Drake of not writing his own raps. Following this, tempers began to flare.\nAt the time, Drake had featured on Mill’s album,RICO. However, following the project’s failure, Mill accused Drake of refusing to promote the single and decided to aim at him, labelling him as a fraudster and a fake.\nAfter Mill’s barrage of abuse and dissemination of falsehoods, Drake decided to publiclyaddress the emcee on not one but two diss tracks: ‘Charged Up’ and the fan-favourite ‘Back to Back.’ Meek Mill responded with a diss track of his own entitled ‘Wanna Know,’ and the pair would exchange subliminal shots on songs over the next few years.\nAlthough from his embarrassing and indisputable loss to Kendrick Lamar, it is clear that no one was giving the 6God advice last year, he has been open to suggestions about how to handle rap battles before.\nAmidst his war with Meek Mill in 2015, Drake received some advice from a superstar athlete. During the 2010s, rumours began swirling that the 6God was in a relationship with the renowned tennis legend Serena Williams. Although this was never confirmed nor denied, the pair did speak about each other openly.\nThat said, during a 2019 appearance on theRap Radarshow with hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian “B. Dot” Miller, the Toronto native opened up about some of the advice he received from Williams during this tense and stressful period of his career.\nOpening up about their various discussions, Drake began, “We had been talking a lot about her and [Maria] Sharapova going back and forth over the years, and she had made this comment to me, ‘If you’re gonna go again… you gotta finish it!’”\nHe continued to explain how her experience as an elite athlete assured him that if he was to win, he had to heed her advice. Recalling how Williams revived his spirit, he continued, “And you know she’s a top competitor. So, she was like, ‘You gotta finish it. I’m talking about done. Over. It’s gotta be something that everyone that he’s with and him have to hear!’ She kind of put this battery in my back.”\nAlthough neither of the public figures has confirmed they ever dated, Drake has referenced Williams in his music before.On his 2013 single ‘Worst Behavior’from his albumNothing Was the Same, he shouted out the iconic tennis player, rapping, “I’m with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib / I swear I could beat Serena when she playin’ with her left.”\nWilliams has also spoken fondly of theHer Losscreator before, and during a 2015 press conference while speaking toEntertainment Tonight, stated, “We’ve been friends for, like, so many years” adding, “[He’s] Just like family.”\nAlthough Williams chose to guide him through his first beef, she definitely was happy to see his downfall as, at this year’s Super Bowl Halftime Show she came out to Crip-walk with Kendrick Lamar as he assassinated Drizzy’s character on national television.",

But those projects might not have been possible if it hadn’t been for one hip-hop legend. The TDE artist believes he wouldn’t be here today without inspiration from one of his favourite rappers.\nThe Los Angeles nativehas cited Nas, Jay-Z, Kurupt and Tupac Shakur as some of his biggest influences, but 50 Cent and Biggie Smalls are at the top of the pile for him. Q has even gone as far as saying that 50 saved his life, seeing similarities between them.\n“We got the same shit going on,” he toldVibe. “Everything he talk about is the same shit I did. I relate to Fifty. I can listen to 50 Cent and tell he really mean what he’s saying. He’s one of them n*ggas that got away with confidence.”\nQ claimed that while 50 doesn’t have the lyrical talent of someone like Hov, he does have the most confidence out of anyone in the genre. 50 inspired him to take his music career seriously after he was released from prison.\n“50 ain’t got the best bars, heain’t got Jay-Z barsbut his confidence on a record… you can’t deny it,” he declared. “I seen where he was doing an interview about Ja Rule during the beef shit, he was saying that any n*gga that just getting out of jail that don’t know what to do with himself is getting into the rap game.”\nHe continued, “Recently, when I just got out of jail, I didn’t know what to do. I wasn’t going to try and finish playing football. That’s when I was fucking around with rapping. I wasn’t really rapping but when I heard that I was like fuck it… I really went hard at it. 50 probably saved my life on some real shit.”\nQ collaborated with 50 on ‘Can I Speak to You’, a track on his5 (Murder by Numbers)mixtape, in 2012. The G-Unit rapper praised Q during an interview withPower 106that year while explaining how the song came about.\n“That 50 and ScHoolboy Q right there, I’m gonna work with the young gunners, we’re gonna get it right,” he said. “I like working with new artists, particularly like Q, I got the chance to kick it with him a little bit and I like him. You know how you just vibe with a person? And I was like, ‘We’re gonna do something together,’ and then I waited, and when I found the right [beat], I sent it to him and we put it together.”\nThe duo collaborated again in 2014 onAnimal Ambition, 50’s last studio album. Q appeared on ‘Flip on You’ from the deluxe version of the project.\nQ has made similar glowing comments about Kendrick Lamar in the past. “Dot taught me,” he said on theBack on Figgpodcast. “Dot taught me so much, bro. Dot… Dot gave me… Dot gave me so much confidence. Dot made me a rapper. This shit make me want to cry right now. Dot saved my life. I owe a lot to Dot.”",

Still, just because he recorded certain music doesn’t mean he always wants to perform it live.\nThe Odd Future rapper is touring hisChromakopiaalbum, which was released in October 2024, but some fans have wanted to hear some of his old material on the road. During his performance at the Kia Center in Orlando, Florida, they demanded Tyler perform songs off hisCherry Bombalbum. But Tyler wasn’t having it and decided to respond to the plea.\nSpeaking on stage, he said, “I genuinely don’t know the logic of why you think that chanting that is going to sway my decision. I don’t want to play that. And most of the crowd doesn’t want me to.”\nOne fan took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a message with Tyler, revealing they started the chant and threatened to do it again. “I started thatCherry Bombchant on Saturday and I will start it again tonight,” the fan said. “I need to hear DEATHCAMP live.”\nIn response, Tyler admitted he found it annoying and revealed there was nothing fans could do to make him perform music from the project. “chant all you want (i hope you dont, its mad annoying during the show) im not gonna play it, chanting doesnt make me magically wanna play it,” he wrote.\nReleased in 2015,Cherry Bombdebuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with 58,000 units.

Tyler once described it as his favourite album in 2018, despite thinkingFlower Boywas his best.\nHowever, whilespeaking to Jerrod Carmichael, he claimed that fans weren’t keen on the album. “I just knew if [Flower Boy] wasn’t good I would be fucked,” he said. “Some people would disagree, but I was like, ‘Man, I’m nothing right now.’ ‘Cause everyone hated it, except for, like, real music lovers who care about drums. I mean, I opened a rap album with a rock song. Most n*ggas is like, ‘Ugh!’”\nHe added, “ForCherry Bomb, I purposely was like, ‘I don’t wanna get personal at all,’ like, ‘I’m just gonna make songs.’ And in [Flower Boy], I was like, ‘Alright, let me write down every feeling.’”\nThe rock song he references is ‘Deathcamp’, one of the tracks his fans wanted him to perform on his current tour. The track has been compared toNERD’s debut album,In Search Of…, an inspiration for Tyler’s career.\nTyler was sued over the song in 2018, with Lela Weems accusing him of copyright infringement and asking for $750,000 in damages. She claimed it illegally sampled the 1971 song ‘Why Can’t There Be Love’ by Dee Edwards and Herman Weems. The case was settled that same year, and Weems is now listed as a co-songwriter.",

However, during a recent appearance on Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes’All the Smokepodcast, the emcee stated that he doesn’t get the credit he deserves as a lyricist.\nWhile speaking to Jackson and Barnes, Luda unveiled that even Jay-Z told him he would never get respect for his lyricism, unveiling, “It was big, but there was a downside to it because even Jay-Z was one of the ones that said, you know, he don’t think I get the lyrical credit that I deserve because of the visuals.”\nWhether it’s album artwork or the way you shoot your music videos, perception and branding are big parts of the music business. If you get it wrong, it can throw off an entire audience and make you an unattractive artist and brand.\nAs such, the cover ofWord Of Moufis so outlandish, and the artwork ofChicken-n-Beeris equally comical, which can lead viewers and listeners to believe that perhaps your music, too, is gimmicky and not serious.\nStating that he did it in the most authentic way to him, Ludacris detailed, “People ask me, ‘Why don’t you think get the credit?’ Because I played too goddamn much, that’s what I do! And I wouldn’t have it any other way. That’s why my name is Ludacris because it’s beyond crazy, it’s wild, it’s ridiculous.”\nLuda has always had crazy, exciting music videos with over-the-top outfits and expressions. However, that has led to many looking at his work as unserious. Elaborating on this, Ludacris explained, “I like post-effects and augmenting reality, big-ass shoes with big-ass chains, and bobbleheads and all that. So I get it; I can’t be mad at it. I just have to show the multi-faceted aspects of myself, and I actually love that.”\nMany MCs can get lost in the visual authenticity conundrum. Although people love and respect Busta Rhymes, his quirky music videos eventually ended, and he is perhaps less recognised as a lyricist due to the fun and silly image he had in the 1990s with videos such as ‘Gimme Some More’ and ‘Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See’ epitomising this.\nStill, although people don’t consider Ludacris one of the greatest lyrically, many fans do hold him in high regard and recognise him as someone who profoundly increased the popularity of Southern rap.",

        "title": "The rapper Lil Durk admits “smoked” him on his own song: “He went super crazy”",
        "description": "Lil Durkis confident in his ability. No matter which rapper he collaborates with, he backs himself to be the better lyricist in the song. However, there’s been one occasion where the Chicago rapper couldn’t help but admit he got one-upped.\nDurkio released one of his biggest tracks in 2023, ‘All My Life’, which appeared on hisAlmost Healedalbum. The song, produced by Dr Luke, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and has over 400 million Spotify streams, with its music video also racking up 236 million views.\nPart of its success is due to the feature from J Cole, who provides a guest verse on the record. During an interview withComplex, Durk admitted Cole had the better verse out of the pair. “He smoked my ass on that one, for one — barely,” he said. “That barely happens. But shout out to J Cole, shout out to [Dr] Luke, we made it happen.”\nIn his verse, Cole raps, “First-generation ghetto n*gga/ Cole world, hello n*ggas/ Made it out the city with my head on straight/ N*ggas keep shootin’ up the lead out Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out/ And the shit that I spit out/ Is a cheat code like I’m facin’ a RICO/ And how a n*gga put a hit out.”\nOnApple Music 1, Durk revealed he waited two years for the J Cole collaboration to happen. “He went super crazy,” he said. “It’s so crazy because we’d been talking for like, two years, and he’d always be like, ‘Send me a record.’ And I’m like, ‘I gotta find the right record.’ I’m glad I waited two years.\n“In my eyes, he a legend. If you have a chance to do a song with a legend, it be like, will you send them something just to send it, just to say you got one, or you gone make it stick? So, that’s why I never just sent him a record. ‘Cause I’m like, ‘I want something that’s gon’ stick.’ As soon as I did the record, he was the first person to pop in my head. Like, I got it. I believe in timing. Timing is everything.”\nNot only was ‘All My Life’ a commercial success, but it also won Best Melodic Rap Performance at theGrammy Awards. The song finds Durk speaking about overcoming life’s battles, no matter the odds stacked against him.\n“Whatever mood I’m in, I just go to the studio and just make the music,” he explained. “I just feel like a positive vibe went up with Dr Luke, you know what I’m saying? That’s the first song he played and I just felt it and I’m like, ‘Man, I want J Cole on this.’ And I made it happen. I’ve been talking to him, checking up on him, just seeing how he’s doing.”\nHe added, “You wait for the right moment for him to ask to be on the song. The song be big. I just wanted to be like, ‘I wantJ Cole on the song.’ So when we do the song, the first person popped in my head, I’m like, ‘I got to get J Cole on this.’”",

        "description": "Jay-Zfamously rapped, “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man/ Let me handle my business, damn,” on the remix of Kanye West’s ‘Diamonds from Sierra Leone’ onLate Registration. Hov is one of the most successful musicians of all time, and he’s used his popularity as a rapper to further boost his net worth with thriving businesses.\nHe became the first billionaire rapper in 2019 and has a reported net worth of $2.5billion as of 2025. A big part of that is due to his moves outside of hip-hop, whether founding companies outright, purchasing businesses, or investing in startups that have led in their field.\nStill, the Brooklyn rapper doesn’t just jump into any opportunity. Everything is calculated, and he has to be true to himself as a person. Jay opened up about his business mindset during an interview withBest Life.\n“I’ve always wanted to stay true to myself, and I’ve managed to do that,” he said. “People have to accept that. I collect art, and I drink wine, things that I like that I had never been exposed to. But I never said, ‘I’m going to buy art to impress this crowd.’ That’s just ridiculous to me. I don’t live my life like that, because how could you be happy with yourself?”\nHe continued, “My brands are an extension of me. They’re close to me. It’s not like running GM, where there’s no emotional attachment. The clothes are an extension of me. The music is an extension of me. All my businesses are part of the culture, so I have to stay true to whatever I’m feeling at the time, whatever direction I’m heading in. And hopefully, everyone follows.”\nJay-Z founded Roc Nation in 2008, becoming a powerhouse in music, sport and film. The label’s rosterincludes Rihanna, J Cole, Jay Electronica, Jaden Smith, Rapsody and The LOX, in addition to managing artists such as Big Sean, Fat Joe, Alicia Keys, Lil Uzi Vert, Megan Thee Stallion and many other big names.\nRoc Nation Sports also boasts stars such as Kevin De Bruyne, LaMelo Ball, Vini Jr, Danny Green, Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford. As far as clothing, Jay founded clothing retailer Rocawear in 1999, which also sold shoes and accessories.\nJay also has a history with various alcoholic beverages, including Armand de Brignac, a luxury champagne brand known as Ace of Spades, which he acquired in 2014 and sold a majority stake. He also had a hand in D’USSÉ, a cognac brand he later sold to Bacardi.\nIn the 2017 song ‘Legacy’ from his4:44album, Jay-Z raps about these brands. He tells his daughter, Blue Ivy, “My stake in Roc Nation should go to you/ Leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too/ TIDAL, the champagne, D’USSÉ, I’d like to see/ A nice peace fund idea from people who look like we.”\nHov also owns 40/40 Club, a luxury sports bar chain he founded in 2003. In his 2003 track ‘Dirt off Your Shoulder’, he raps, “Now, you chillin’ with a boss, bitch, of course; ‘SC’ on the sleeve/ At the 40/40 Club, ESPN on the screen.”\nHepurchased streaming service TIDALin 2015 for $56 million before selling a majority stake in 2021. He also has venture capital investments in technology and startup companies like Uber.",

        "description": "Sexyy Redput herself on the map in 2023 with ‘Pound Town’, a song that received attention for the graphic lyric, “My coochie pink, my booty-hole brown.” Many people have classed the song as part of the “pussy rap” wave, which is described as “a subgenre of rap where women embrace their sexual prowess” in the face of “the patriarchy and misogyny.”\nHowever, the 27-year-old (real name Janae Wherry) is determined not to be boxed into something by listeners. Instead, her music coversall of her experiences. She doesn’t want one lyric about her genitals defining her sound.\n“I don’t agree with that [classification], because why is that the only thing you heard me talking about?” she toldBillboard. “That’s the only thing that you got out of everything I just said? You just heard me say ‘coochie’? I hate when they say that. I just rap about my daily life. Girls that live like me, I just rap about what we go through. I don’t sit and talk about coochie all day.”\nSongs like ‘Free My N***a’ are a prime example of lyrics that detail her real life. “When I don’t hear from my n*gga, I write him/ He a bad boy, I don’t care, that’s how I like ’em/ Yeah, free my n*gga ’til it’s backwards/ Fuck the police, fuck the pigs, they some bastards.” Her manager, Dave Gross, says, “Authenticity is self-relative, and for Sexyy, it’s that she’s independent, fierce, strong, unafraid of the world’s opinions and unbowed by backlash.”\n‘Pound Town’ has over 38million streams on Spotify and 34million YouTube views.Nicki Minaj was also featuredon the remix, ‘Pound Town 2’, which boasts over 77mSpotify streams and peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\nShe’s gone from strength to strength since, with songs like ‘Got It Sexyy’, ‘Whatchu Know About Me’ with GloRilla, and ‘Fat Juicy & Wet’ featuring Bruno Mars charting in the top 20. She most recently released herIn Sexyy We Trustmixtape in May 2024, which featured Drake on the song ‘U My Everything’. She also joined Drizzy as a support act on his and 21 Savage’sIt’s All a Blur Tour, further boosting her popularity.\nSpeaking toXXL, Sexyy Red shared her thoughts on the public perception of her. “They’re starting to understand me a little bit, but I really don’t care if they don’t because if you get it, you get it. If you don’t, you don’t,” she said. “Whoever meets me and we click, that means they understand me. They understand where I come from.”\nShe added, “But if you don’t, that means you’re trying to learn or figure it out. But that’ll take you to sit back and see, ‘Why does she act like this? Where does she come from?’ I came from something different from you, so I’m not gonna act the way you act or how you expect me to act. The people that don’t get it, they wasn’t raised like me, so now they gotta figure it out.”",

        "title": "The song that saw Drake get sued by his ex-girlfriend",
        "description": "Drakeput himself on the map during the early 2010s with albums such asThank Me Later,Take Care, andNothing Was the Same. He built a reputation for wearing his heart on his sleeve and expressing his emotions in his music, and songs like ‘Marvin’s Room’ were prime examples of that.\nDespite being a downbeat track, the song, built around keyboard-based instrumentation and muted bass, succeeded through its storytelling and even charted at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. The record is performed from the perspective of a drunk Drake calling up an ex-girlfriend to pour out thoughts about his loneliness.\nThe Toronto rapper famously sings in the chorus, “Fuck that n*gga that you love so bad/ I know you still think about the times we had/ I say fuck that n*gga that you think you found/ And since you pick up, I know he’s not around.”\n‘Marvin’s Room‘ is named after Marvin Gaye’s studio, where Drake recorded the song. Singer Ericka Lee, who claims to be Drizzy’s ex-girlfriend, provides vocals throughout the track, saying, “Are you drunk right now?” at several points.\nThat same woman sued Drake in 2012, claiming she was excluded from co-writer royalties for the song. In documents filed in Los Angeles, Lee alleged she had a romantic and business relationship with Drake between early 2010 and the middle of 2011. She claimed they exchanged poems and lyrics throughout their relationship, with Drake allegedly agreeing to split the earnings of ‘Marvin’s Room’ for her work.\nLee said she originally intended to record a chorus for ‘Marvin’s Room’ and perform a speech to frame the lyrics. She alleged that Drake acknowledged her work over text messages; in one, she claimed he said, “U basically made that song.”\nTheir relationship was said to have ended following the song’s release. Drake allegedly offered her two per cent of the publishing royalties for the song before raising the offer to 4-5 per cent along with a $50,000 settlement. Following the offer, Lee asked for a co-writing credit and undisclosed damages.\nIn response,Drake’s team said, “This claim is entirely without merit and our client has not engaged in any wrongful conduct. Ericka Lee consented to the use of her voice in the song ‘Marvin’s Room’ prior to its release. Lee asked only for the credit she received as ‘Syren Lyric Muse,’ and she did not ask for any compensation.”\nThe statement continued, “It was only after she retained a lawyer that there was a demand for payment. Drake tried for months to resolve the matter amicably, and he now looks forward to being vindicated in court.” The case was eventually dismissed in 2013 after being settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.\nDrake’s longtime collaborator, Noah ’40’ Shebib, produced the song. “I made that beat in a few hours,” he toldVibe. “[Drake] comes in, like, ‘I’m using this.’ I’m like, ‘No, no, it’s not done yet. I just started.’ He’s like, ‘No, it’s done. Don’t do anything else.’ It stayed that way. My objective is to make him happy. If he says yes, then I’m good.”\nHe added, “Sometimes. I challenge Drake when it comes to decision making. He didn’t want to put ‘Marvin’s Room’ onTake Careand I was like, ‘Bro, fuck you, you’ve gotta put this on there. It’s a moment.’”",

        "description": "Missy Elliottand Timbaland formed one of the most iconic partnerships in hip-hop history. They combined for albums such asSupa Dupa Fly,Da Real World,Miss E… So Addictive,Under Construction andThis Is Not a Test!, resulting in hit singles like ‘Work It’, ‘Get Ur Freak On’, ‘Hot Boyz’ and ‘The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)’.\nThe rapper-producer duo are both from Virginia Beach and met through Timbaland’s longtime collaborator, Magoo,with whom he released three albums. Through a mutual friend, Magoo met Tim, who was more of a DJ than a producer at that point.\n“I first met Tim through a guy who is Tim and I’s best friend,” he toldRed Bull Music Academy.“His name is Larry Lyons. I met Larry when he came to Chesapeake, Virginia to attend high school. He was from Virginia Beach. Within a month, he started telling me about this guy in Virginia Beach who was a really good DJ, beat boxer, and producer. But at the time, Tim was more well-known for being a DJ.”\nMagoo then introduced Timbaland to Missy Elliott afterdiscovering her group, Fayze(later known as Sista), through another friend. He told the collective about Tim, and they were sold the first time they met him.\n“I met Tim in 1988 when he was 16 years-old,” he explained. “I met Missy through someone else, too. Initially, Larry, Tim, and I were in a record store. Missy was in a group called Fayze, and they had a record out locally, and it was playing on the radio already. The song was performing pretty well. While I was in the record store, I picked up their record. I was like, ‘We have to meet these girls.’\n“About a month later, a guy from my neighbourhood calls me and said, ‘I have Fayze in the car with me.’ So, I get in the car with them, and I started telling them about Tim. We ended up going over to Virginia Beach, and when we got there, they met Tim.”\nHe continued, “When they met him, they wanted to pick him up as a producer. Unfortunately for the guy who introduced me to them, he was also a producer, but they ended up choosing Tim to work with. This was around 1991 or 1992.”\nSista released one album,4 All the Sistas Around da World, in 1994. Timbaland produced Missy Elliott’s solo debut,Supa Dupa Fly, three years later. Speaking on the album on X (formerly Twitter) in 2022, she said, “My first album was stress-free because I didn’t have any expectations. My label told me they would give me my own label if I did one album so me and Timbaland completed this album in two weeks, not knowing this would be the beginning of many more to come.”\nAs for the follow-up,Da Real World, released in 1999, she admitted, “I was so hard on myself and for a while, this was my least favourite, until years later I realised the MASTERPIECE Timbaland and I had created.”",

        "description": "Black Thoughtis a master of his craft and considered one of the best MCs of all time for good reason. As the lead vocalist of The Roots, he’s released classic albums like 1995’sDo You Want More?!!!??!, 1996’sIlladelph Halflifeand 1999’sThings Fall Apart. Fast-forward to today, he’s branched out with equally impressive projects alongside Danger Mouse, Salaam Remi and 9th Wonder.\nThe 51-year-old (real name Tariq Trotter) wouldn’t have developed the skills on display today without some of his inspirations.He cites Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, and Whodini as early influences while also nodding to George Clinton, Stevie Wonder, and Sly and the Family Stone.\nHowever, his favourite rap verse of all time belongs to Kool G Rap. The New York City rapper is one of the most gifted lyricists ever to do it, inspiring future greats such as Biggie Smalls, Nas, Eminem and Jay-Z. Thought’s ultimate G Rap verse appears on ‘Road to the Riches’ from his 1989 album with DJ Polo.\n“Kool G Rap has always been super scalpel sharp,” he toldPitchfork. “It was, you know, it was repetitive in that way, but in a good way. In a way, that was inspiring to me. That sort of rubbed off, whether it was what I was trying to do or not, you know what I mean? It just, that’s what was impressive for me.”\nThought went into detail about the first time he heard the song as a school kid, having just formed a partnership with Questlove. Little did he know then that it was the origins of The Roots.\n“The first time I heard ‘Road to the Riches’ I was probably somewhere ninth or 10th grade,” he explained. “I recently formed a rap group with my partner, who was a drummer at the time, who would later go on tocall himself Questlove, and I would later call myself Black Thought. We would later become The Roots but we were, I don’t know what we were called at that time.\n“I was also working after school I had an after school job at a pizza place called Pizzeria Uno. And I remember I had like a yellow sort of sports Walkman that was chunky and you could drop it without breaking it and stuff. I would listen to this record on my way to work and on my way home at three o’clock in the morning after work.”\nBlack Thought could relate to the lyrics due to his job at the time, giving him inspiration as a young man trying to make it in life. “I just really identified with the story of not only was it arags to riches story, with which I could absolutely identify because I was in the rags phase of my life,” he said. “But he was talking about in this tale, which is a well-rounded sort of narrative and a full cautionary tale.\n“He was talking about working in a restaurant, and being a porter. And washing dishes and sweeping floors and doing many of the things that I was doing while listening to this record. So, it sort of gave me hope. You know what I mean? It gave me hope as an artist that where I was in life, I wasn’t necessarily destined to be there forever.”",

        "title": "The bizarre story of hip-hop’s fascination with Grey Poupon",
        "description": "Rappers (as street poets) use a lot of brand names in their rhymes, and, in contemporary hip-hop, they’re usually confined to luxury alcohol brands and designer clothes. However, there is an outlier which seems to appear again and again in hip-hop without fail.\nThe brand name that seems to have found a home in rap lyrics is Grey Poupon, the mustard brand. It’s not because MCs have a particular affinity for mustard or even because it is particularly high-end, but its persistence is strange.\nFrom Ghostface Killah and Kanye to Raekwon and Lil Wayne, across eras from the 1980s to the present, lyricists have referenced the condiment brand, and not for no reason. It comes as no surprise thatbrand names such as Rolex, Gucci, and Ferrarimake regular appearances. Still, Grey Poupon? Does it have any particular allure?\nWell, fans can trace the story back to the 1980s when the mustard brand launched an expensive and unrelenting commercial campaign that led to Americans knowing the phrase  “Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?” by heart. The Dijon mustard brand began by advertising in newspapers read by older middle-class generations. Still, after presenting the condiment as a luxury but affordable in a series of television advertisements, Grey Poupon saw a 100% jump in sales.\nThe first commercial from 1981 spiked sales, and the second round saw a similar rise. The television advertisements presented the mustard brand in a range of settings, including on yachts, at fancy parties, and in luxury cars, which gave the brand a reputation for being fancy. The television advertising campaign crafted by Lee Garfinkel ran in various forms until 1991 when the first Grey Poupon reference appeared in hip-hop.\nIn 1991, Das EFX began recording their debut studio album,Dead Serious, which went platinum after its release. However, on the track ‘East Coast’ we see the first mention of the condiment when he rhymes “He’s the don, have you seen my Grey Poupon? Bust this, we roll more spliffs than Cheech and Chong.”\nStill, since then, the use of the brand name has risen and risen even though it is no longer seen as culturally relevant. During an interview, Open Mike Eagle explained why he believes it appears so often, stating, “I think for this particular phrase, there are a couple of reasons for it. First of all, it is just how convenient of a rhyme it is. It rhymes with coupon, neutron, futon and all of these things that are around.”\nHowever, one of the main reasons it has stuck around is its original advert and its association with being of a high class. The mustard was only ever seen being used by upper-class individuals and was always presented as a must-have for wealthy people looking for “gourmet” mustard. As such, it has becomea strange status symbol akin to Cristal and Hennessy.\nAlthough rappers were still mentioning it in the early 2000s, the sheer number of number-one hit tracks that mentioned the brand name in 2007 led to a massive jump in people using the mustard for their rhymes. From Kendrick Lamar to Lil Wayne and Kanye West, it saw such a rise that West was still using it in 22016 onLife Of Pablo,rapping, “Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury / I give ’em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!”\nHip-hop’s obsession with Grey Poupon most definitely shows that, with clever marketing and an emphasis on luxury, you can most definitely make a brand the next rap music brand buzzword.",

        "description": "NWA’s beef withIce Cubehas become one of hip-hop’s most notorious feuds because it culminated in one of hip-hop’s most savage diss tracks — ‘No Vaseline’. The song effectively led to the collective’s destruction and still stands as one of the best diss tracks ever made.\nNWA was a legendary group, and the gangsta rap movement it sparked was epic. However, despite being a proud member of the collective, Ice Cube had a tenuous relationship with his fellow members. Alongside Dr Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella, and MC Ren, Cube reached the top of the charts in the 1980s, but one individual drove a wedge between theDeath Certificatecreator and the rest of his group —Jerry Heller.\nThe group, which was formed in 1986, had massive commercial success. Still, Ice Cube decided to break away from the collective after becoming frustrated with Jerry Heller, the crew’s manager and founder of Ruthless Records.\nEazy-E put much of his faith in Heller, but Ice Cube knew the collective was getting ripped off by the executive and not being given what they were worth. In his diss track, the emcee aimed at all of his former friends and highlighted their blind loyalty. Furthermore, he believed that Eazy-E (as the group’s frontman) was taking a more significant cut than he deserved for songs they had all contributed to.\nDuring an interview withNME,Ice Cube explained the exact turning point in his career that led him to leave NWA. Speaking about the unfair paymenthe received forStraight Outta Comptonand the dodgy cheque he was pressured to take from Heller, theLethal Injectioncreator recalled, “I refused to take my cheque because I felt that I would be admitting that I agreed with what I was bein’ paid.”\nHowever, the sum of money he was turning down seemed like a lot to his peers. Speaking about how his counterparts were aghast at his decision not to take the money from Jerry Heller, the emcee continued, “They [the other group members] thought I was crazy! I heard comments like, ‘For $75,000, I don’t care what that contract says. I would sign that shit two times.’ They were like, ‘What’s wrong with you? This is more money than we’ve ever seen, and you wanna be the dark cloud in the shit?'”\nStill, it wasn’t justStraight Outta Comptonthat Ice Cube was unhappy with; he also believed that he had contributed much to Eazy-E’s debut project,Eazy-Duz-It.Unfortunately for him, Eazy-E wasn’t looking to give any money for his work.\nOpening up about the release ofEazy-Duz-Itshortly after the group’s debut, Ice Cube toldNME,“The cheque was just forStraight Outta Compton,but we’d worked on both records equally! I felt like we deserved more of both pies. We put as much time and effort intoEazy-Duz-Itas intoStraight Outta Compton– all of us. But Eazy wanted to keep all theEazy-Duz-Itmoney and just pay us the NWA money and take his share out of the NWA money!”\nIn the long term, Ice Cube knew it wouldn’t be sustainable to have one NWA member getting paid more than the rest regularly without some sort of unrest, so he decided toput his feelings on ‘No Vaseline’ and leave.That said, his decision wasn’t that controversial because the year his diss track was released, Dr Dre also left the collective to form Death Row Records, meaning evenThe Chroniccreator knew the NWA movement had reached an end.\nAfter leaving NWA, Ice Cube was very successful as a solo artist and even entered Hollywood. However, he was the first to see that NWA was no longer able to survive as a group.",

        "title": "What is Busta Rhymes most challenging rap?",
        "description": "Busta Rhymesis definitely a lyricist who is on a different level regarding lyrics. Only some MCs can rap fast, and, akin to a rapper like Eminem, Busta can pack a lot of syllables and words into his verses. Furthermore,the Brooklyn lyricisthas proven that he can add more character to his songs than many run-of-the-mill rappers.\nWith quirky voices, nods to his Jamaican heritage, and a clever bending of words, Busta has a way with words. However, he is most known for his quick-fire delivery; on some tracks, it is impossible to keep up with his words. Furthermore, it is often unbelievable how much he manages to say in such a short time.\nAlthoughthe ‘Touch It’ can rapperquickly and often manages to do it seamlessly, he can also flow perfectly on a slow beat as evidenced on his song ‘Pass The Courvoisier Pt II’ and ‘What’s It Gonna Be’ featuring Janet Jackson.\nAlthough Busta Rhymes is still making music, one of the things he is most renowned for is his impossible verses — the verses that are almost impossible to memorise and recite word for word perfectly. Some have tried and many have failed but we have compiled a list of some of Busta’s hardest tongue-twisters.\nThis 2010 track sees an appearance from the old school legend Jaz-O who mentored and helped a young Jay-Z as well as Layzie Bone and Twista who is known for his fast rhyming. However, no one can beat Busta at his own game on this track.\nThe instrumental, produced by DJ Kay Slay was designed to be rhymed on in double-time so every artist on the song raps speedily. Still, Busta (who appears first) manages to top the rest with his slick and effortless ability to rap at that speed with perfect breath-control.\nThis rock-rap track features a line-up of only lyricists and is a track that’s all about the syllables. One can literally hear the staccato syllables firing like bullets over the metal-inspired beat and incredible to behold.\nAlongside Tech N9ne and MCs such as Yelawolf and Twista, Busta doesn’t sound like he’s rapping so fast because the track overall is so speedy it’s very hard to know who is rapping when but it is indisputably a rapid-fire song.\nProduced by Dr. Dre and Scott Storch, this beat is renowned, and Busta’s speed on the track is also part of the song’s iconic status. Although he cleverly and intricately weaves some breaks into his verses, for the most part, it is nonstop lyrical activity from Busta on this track that is hard to comprehend.\nAs he hurls verse after verse at listeners, initially, it appears he has no intent on stopping. That said, he shows an unrelenting passion and as usual he is going at a pace that no other rapper could ever manage. The song was produced at 83 Beats Per Minute (BPM) but Busta Rhymes emcees in double-time choosing to deliver his lyrics at a rate of 166 bpm.\n‘Gimme Some More’ has an odd skip to its drum pattern, and it’s something that is loved by fans but wasn’t initially popular with the Brooklyn emcee. With a sample   of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 cult classicPsycho, the beat is most definitely unique.\nFurthermore, the producer, DJ Scratch, made it at 137 beats per minute nearly double some of hip-hop’s most famous boom-bap instrumentals. Still, theGenesiscreator manages to smoothly ride the music and with a Hype Williams music video, the song has become an iconic piece of rap art.\nRegardless of its status the song’s second verse is unbelievably hard to follow and with several switches of flow it would be almost almost impossible to remember and recite perfectly.\nThis beat is iconic but Busta Rhymes verse is unbelievably hard to keep up with. in fact it is probably one of the fastest verses ever delivered in rap music. Delivered at 146 Beats Per Minute its a challenge for listeners let alone the emcee who delivered it.\nBusta has become synonymous with this song and his verse is, arguably, the highlight of the track due to its energetic, dynamic and powerful delivery. The rapper has rapped it on the radio, in front of cameras and every time has done it with perfection. It is undoubtedly his fastest verse of all time.",

        "description": "Papooseand Remy Ma are one of the biggest celebrity couples in the hip-hop world. The pair married in 2008, exchanging wedding vows over the phone when she was in prison, serving eight years for assault, weapons and attempted coercion charges. Their relationship has been up and down in the public eye since, marrying in a formal ceremony that aired in the finale ofLove & Hip Hop: New York‘s sixth season in 2016.\nRemy was discovered by Big Pun and made her name as a member ofFat Joe’s Terror Squad, releasing her debut albumThere’s Something About Remy: Based on a True Storyin 2006. She’s best known for songs such as ‘Lean Back’ and ‘All the Way Up’. Papoose, on the other hand, is known for his freestyles and mixtapes.\nDuring an interview withHipHopDXin 2022, the two artists were asked to name each other’s favourite verses. Papoose picked out Remy’s 2008 song ‘When I See Her’, rapping, “60 seconds to a minute, it’s a problem when I see her/ Seven days a week, alternate sides of the street/ I’ma drag that bitch like the motherfuckin’ beat.”\nHe added, “That’s my favourite Remy song, period.” While admitting she knew it was his favourite song, she said, “I’ve never seen him act it out like that. I was like, ‘Okay!'” Papoose said, “Yo, let me tell you something. I’m waiting to hear this shit right here what she gon’ say.\nRemy chose Papoose’s 2005 track‘The Underground King’, spitting, “I got this shit locked, nickname sing sing/ My chain bling bling/ Say you bust your ding ding/ Well, I do the same damn thing/ I’m the underground king.”\n“Yo, that’s crazy,” Papoose said. “Man, I want y’all to know I never, ever knew that. This is my first time even hearing that information.” Remy replied, “‘Cause he get mad gassed. I gotta play the songs inside when I’m in the car by myself.”\nThe couple had their first child together, a daughter named Reminisce MacKenzie, in 2018. However, the couple’s relationship has soured in recent years, withRemy accusing Papoose of cheating on herwith world champion boxer Claressa Shields. Papoose fired back by claiming she repeatedly cheated on him and that he had been wanting a divorce for a while.\n“Sad to say that @remyma is a narcissist,” he wrote on Instagram. “She chose to cheat repeatedly. Now that I finally moved on, she’s playing the victim. I have requested a divorce numerous times. She rather clout chase on social media than handle this like civilised adults. I did not wanna do the social media foolishness. For the sake of my six year old baby. She has to go to school. As you can see I remained quiet through this all.”\nRumours circulated that Remy cheated on Papoose with battle rapper Eazy The Block Captain. After denying they were dating, they were spotted in public several times. Remy admitted she “loved” him at a battle between Eazy and Shotgun Suge in January.",

        "description": "Tyler, The Creatorhas a deep love of music. You can hear it in the evolution of his albums and the passion in his voice when he breaks down his favourite songs from other artists. Never afraid of raw emotions, the Odd Future rapper once revealed that a Kanye West song made him break down into tears.\nIn 2018, between the release of hisFlower BoyandIGORalbums, Tyler was asked if it was true that he cried while listening to Kanye’s latest album. “Yeah, when I heard ‘Violent Crimes,'” he toldGQ. “Those chords, like, fucking—I can’t explain what they do to me.\n“I always talk about chords and probably sound like a fucking dork, but since I was fucking four years old, I would always say it was a slant or it went up, ’cause I didn’t know what chords were, but it was a thing that music did that I just felt in my fucking body. And that was the most recent song that did it to me. Like, one out of ten, that shit did it a 12, and I just—my eyes just started watering. I couldn’t explain it. I hope when I die, it gets explained to me.”\n‘Violent Crimes’ is the closing track on Kanye’s 2018 album,Ye. The song finds West discussing his changing perspective towards women following the birth of hisdaughters, North and Chicago.\nHe raps in the song, “N*ggas is savage, n*ggas is monsters/ N*ggas is pimps, n*ggas is players/ ‘Til n*ggas have daughters, now they precautious/ Father, forgive me, I’m scared of the karma/ ‘Cause now I see women as somethin’ to nurture/ Not somethin’ to conquer I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster/ Not havin’ ménages, I’m just bein’ silly.”\nDespite the emotional nature of the track, Kanye previously revealed he didn’t actually write it. “Pardison Fontaine wrote the ‘Violent Crimes’ verses,” he wrote on social media. “I changed two lines. He wrote the entire song though. Cyhi Cons Pardi. The ghost in the industry.” Nicki Minaj appears in the song’s outro with a spoken word piece.\nTyler’s admiration goes both ways. In 2020’sCherry Bombdocumentary, Kanye admitted that his 2013 albumYeezuswouldn’t exist without Tyler. “Work with your hands, it keeps you earnest,” Ye told Tyler. “You see the lines on your record in my hands right here. I’m glad you put that battery in my back when you said that line, man. That’s one of your jobs in hip-hop.”\nHe added, “I don’t think there would have been aYeezusif it wasn’t for you. I don’t think it would’ve been this verse right here if it wasn’t for you, or the shit [Lil Wayne] just did. Because it’s certain n*ggas who push you differently.”\nThe two artists collaborated on ‘Smuckers’ from 2015’sCherry Bombalbum. However, that wasn’t the only time they crossed paths. Kanye provided backing vocals on ‘Puppet’ in 2019, with Tyler returning the favour on ‘Come to Life’ from the deluxe version of 2021’sDonda.",

        "title": "Why doesn’t Jay-Z write down his lyrics?",
        "description": "It’s common knowledge thatJay-Zdoesn’t write down his lyrics. The Brooklyn rapper has become one of the greatest lyricists of all time without putting pen to paper, using his memory to put words, lines and entire songs together, not to mention coming up with quadruple entendres.\nThat process began as a teenager when he was on the streets as a drug dealer. He didn’t carry any paper notebooks around, so he had no choice but to keep his rhymes in his head. “The more I got into the street, when I was 18 or 19, the fur­ther away from the notebook I became,” he explained toRolling Stone. “When I was outside, I’d start thinking of all these lyrics, and I’d find anything I could write on.\n“So I had all these pieces of paper in my pocket, then I’d get back to the house and dump all these papers out and put ’em in the notebook. You can only have so many pieces of paper in your pockets, so I started memorising some lines until I got back to the book. It was like an exercise. Pretty soon I would just memorise all these songs, and it grew from there. When I made my first demos, around ’92, that was my process.”\nHowever, that same process has also led to Jay-Z losing many ideas. “I’ve lost a lot of songs that way,” he toldCBS News. “I’ve lost a lot of material. But it just came with life.”\nThe only time he ever wrote down lyrics was for ‘Can I Live’ from his debut albumReasonable Doubtin 1996. “What happened was, I was doing that song with someone else, and they heard the first verse and they was like, ‘Man, you take that song. Finish it, ’cause it sounds like you got a lot more to say,’” he said toMTV News. “So I just wanted to get it down quick, I didn’t want to keep going over it. It was like [the album] mastering time, so I just sat down in the booth and wrote that [verse].”\nJay-Z attempted to write down all of his lyrics for 2003’sThe Black Album, which was intended to be his final album before retirement, but he couldn’t shake off the format he knows best. “It just felt better [the way I do it now],” he said. “In my mind, I said, ‘OK, I’m gonna sit down and I’mma just write it and really do this thing a certain way.’ But your natural process is your process. It’s difficult to go back to what you was doing when you was 15, 16 years old. My process is different now.”\nHe added, “It sounds great on paper, like ‘I’mma sit down, I’m going to write the entire album like I did before.’ But once you get back in the studio and you’ve been doing this process for years and years now, so it just felt natural to do it the way I’ve been doing it: no paper, no pen, just listen to the music.”",

        "title": "The reason why Eminem hated his classic song ‘My Name Is’",
        "description": "‘My Name Is’ was the song that propelledEmineminto the limelight. Released in 1999, it appeared onThe Slim Shady LPand won Marshall Mathers his first Grammy Award for ‘Best Rap Solo Performance’ in 2000.\nThe record was recorded during hisfirst ever session with Dr Dre, and is known for its undeniably catchy chorus: “Hi, my name is, what?/ My name is, who?/ My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady.” The basis of the hook stems from an interpolation of Labi Siffre’s 1975 track ‘I Got The…’, which Eminem initially freestyled over.\nEm toldGenius, “I was like, ‘Yo, this is it, this is my shot. If I don’t impress this guy, I’m going back home and I’m fucked.’ I knew Dre wasn’t an easy person to please. I made sure that everything he had a beat for, I had a rhyme ready to go, or I came up with a rhyme on the spot.”\nHowever, that eagerness to impress Dre was also why he initially hated ‘My Name Is’. During an interview withRolling Stone, Slim Shady spoke about disliking the song because of its commercial aspect when it was released.\n“I ended up hating the record in the early days, because I always looked at myself as an underground MC,” he admitted. “I remember havingconversations with Royce [Da 5’9″]before we made it: ‘Yo, man, we’re not the type of artists to go gold.’ All I wanted to do was make enough money to not have to work a regular job, have a decent house, be able to support my family. So I was shocked that ‘My Name Is’ was successful.”\nHe added, “I probably felt, ‘I’m just rapping on there!’ I’m just going, ‘Hi, my name is — my name is — my name is — chka-chka, Slim Shady.’ That’s it. It was an introduction to the world, but I didn’t know it was an introduction to the world.”\nTo this day, ‘My Name Is‘ remains one of the biggest songs of Em’s career. It has gone four times platinum in the US and two times platinum in the UK. The track boasts over 694 million Spotify streams, and its music video has also racked up 278 million views on YouTube.\nEminem takes pride in his lyrics and isn’t content with his delivery until he’s pushed himself to the fullest. “If I feel I’ve pushed myself to the furthest extent that I can, then it’s done. But if it’s not, here’s more,” he said. “And nothing ever sounds as good as it does in my head. So when I say a rhyme or whatever, you should hear it in my head!\n“If it was up to me and I was just recording demos, I’d tell a story here and there, but mostly it’d be just technical all the time. If I put a record out and it’s got some kind of hook on it but there’s no lyrical aspect to it, that’s fucking terrible. That’s corny, to me.”\n",

        "description": "Kanye Westis one of the greatest artists of all time, particularly through his run of albums between 2004’sThe College Dropoutand 2016’sThe Life of Pablo. Before rapping, making beats was his first passion and way of making a name for himself in the hip-hop industry. So much so, rappers and label executives initially couldn’t take him seriously as an MC.\nThat all changed with his debut single ‘Through the Wire’, with Roc-A-Fella Records reluctantly signing him to the label for his debut album. “We figured if we kept him close, at the very least we’d still have some hot beats,” Jay-Z toldRolling Stone. Following the commercial success ofThe College Dropout, Jay admitted, “It went from skepticism to excitement.”\nDame Dash once claimed that Jay didn’t want to sign Kanye, but Jay denied his comments, alleging he always wanted him for his production. “Let’s first clear this thing about Dame and Kanye and all of us,” he explained toXXL. “We all had a conversation about Kanye and whether to sign him. No one knew what would become of Kanye. Not Dame, not me, not [Kareem ‘Biggs’ Burke].\n“So we all sat down and said, ‘Let’s at least sign so we can keep the tracks in-house. It’s only good business.’ And Dame said, ‘We can put [Beanie Sigel] and [Cam’ron], surround him and make this type of album.’ I wasn’t saying don’t sign Kanye; I was saying, at least keep the beats in-house, if anything.”\nDuring an interview with Zane Lowe forBBC Radio 1, Kanye West opened up about producing for different types of artists. “I just think that I’m a production person, I’m a product guy, I’m a producer,” he said. “So if I’m working on a John Legend album, I’m gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in.\n“And I’m gonna try to push Pusha T — no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me — to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up.”\nKanye’s production catalogue ranges from underground rappers to mainstream, not excluding plenty of collaborations withR&B artists. A true master of his craft, he’s produced iconic songs for everyone from Ludacris and Lil Wayne to Dilated People and Slum Village, while offering gems to Janet Jackson and Alicia Keys.",

        "description": "In 1994, West Coast legendTupac Shakurgot shot in the lobby of Quad Studios in Manhattan. Not only was it a painful moment for the emcee himself, but it would also mark the start of something much uglier: his feud with Biggie Smalls. Still, some people didn’t take it as seriously as he did.\nOne person who certainly did not see it as a big deal was Diddy. Following the shooting, 2Pac had assured himself that the Bad Boy record label and everyone associated with it were responsible for the attempted murder, and he was firm in his position.\nHowever, during that period, Bad Boy adamantly and repeatedly denied having any involvement with the shooting and to this day, people still question whether or not Diddy was involved. That said, at the time, Diddy wasn’t afraid to speak about the incident, and even during the height of the East Coast-West Coast beef, the Bad Boy founder didn’t hold his tongue aboutthe ‘Dear Mama’ rhymer.\nFollowing the Quad Studios hit, 2Pac was vocal about Diddy and told various outlets that Bad Boy was behind it. However, in a 1996 interview withVibemagazine, the now-incarcerated musician implied that 2Pac knew who shot him but was using the incident as an opportunity to disparage his protégé Biggie Smalls.\nOpening up to vibe about the robbery and shooting, Diddy declared, “He knows who shot him! If you ask him, he knows, and everybody in the street knows, and he’s not stepping to them, because he knows that he’s not gonna get away with that s***. To me, that’s some real sucker s***.”\nFurthermore, Diddy insisted that as well as being a “sucker”, 2Pac was using him and Biggie Smalls as scapegoats, asserting, “Be mad at everybody, man; don’t be using niggas as scapegoats.” Still, he then praised theAll Eyez On Memusician, adding, “We know that he’s a nice guy from New York. All shit aside, Tupac is a nice, good-hearted guy.”\nBy this time, 2Pac was already on the rampage and had releasedhis infamous diss track, ‘Hit Em Up’. Furthermore, only a year prior to Diddy’s interview, ‘Pac had sat down withVibe,where he detailed the shooting.\nBut in 2Pac’s recollection, he was ambushed and shot in the building’s lobby, then taken in the elevator up to the studio, where he saw about 40 people, including Biggie and Puffy. That said, although fans will never know who was behind the shooting, Diddy definitely had some choice words for the late legend.",

        "description": "Tom Hardy is a legendary actorwho has appeared in a number of incredible films. FromInceptiontoLawless,Hardy is one of the most preeminent British actors. However, the UK actor also has a strange love forhip-hop.\nHip-hop and Hollywood have intersected on several occasions. One lyricist who has appeared on the big screen several times is Busta Rhymes. Aside from being a renowned musician and highly skilled rapper,the ‘Gimme Some More’ rhymeris also an esteemed actor who has made many movie appearances.\nThe Brooklyn native has been featured inShaft,Halloween: Resurrection, The Mod Squad, and more. However, he is not the only emcee who successfully transitioned into Hollywood. Other MCs who have made the transition include Method Man and Redman. Strangely, one thing all these lyricists have in common is that they inspired the voice of one movie character. In an interview, British actor Tom Hardy revealed that these three rhymers helped him create the voice of the alien villainVenom.\nThe extraterrestrial antagonist, who hides behind the human guise of Eddie Brock, is a menace, and Hardy voices both the alien symbiote and the more peaceful Brock. That said, while trying to craft the intonations and cadences ofVenom, Hardy once revealed that Method Man, Redman, and Busta Rhymes all influenced the final sound of the villain’s voice.\nThe first instalment ofVenomwas released in 2018, and the sequel,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,was a big hit at the box office.As such,in an interview onBBC Radiowith Ali Plumb,Hardy explained how Wu-Tang’s Method Man influenced Venom’s gravelly voice along with other MCs.\nOpening up about how he replicates the eerie and scary voice of Venom, Hardy told Plumb, “So, I mix a little bit of Busta Rhymes, a little bit of Method and Redman, a little bit of James Brown, and ever so slightly, an element of Richard Burton.”\nAlthough it’s hard for many to imagine, Tom Hardy is a huge fan of hip-hop and once pursued a career in rap music as Tommy No. 1 before he switched to acting. However, during this period he worked with an industry figure who used to manage Lauryn Hill and actually recorded an unfathomable amount of unreleased hip-hop music.\nStill, one of Hardy’s mixtapes is available on YouTube. Entitled,Falling on Your Arse, the project was released in 1999. Although he has never spoken about the recording of the mixtape, he has revealed that to get into the zone and record the rap-inspired, gravelly voice of Venom, he likes to have a separate studio session.\nIn a 2018 interview withCinemovie,the film’s director, Ruben Fleischer, spoke about how Hardy captures the unique voice, explaining, “He would do this incredible thing before we shot scenes with Venom where he would record the whole scene as scripted between Eddie and Venom.”\nHe concluded, “Then they would take out Eddie’s voice, and then he would put in an earwig where he would be able to hear and then so in the middle of a scene, if Venom starts talking to him, they would play his recording of the Venom voice in his ear so he had something to react to.”",

        "title": "The rapper who wrote for Kanye West without credit: “There are a lot of songs”",
        "description": "Kanye Westis a talented songwriter—there’s no disputing that. But he might not have experienced the same success without some of his affiliates. Over the years, particularly since 2010’sMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Ye’s album credits have grown in terms of collaborators, often listing up to 10 writers per song. Someone who has been alongside Kanye through it all is Rhymefest, who has had a notable impact on his career.\nOn paper, the Chicago rapper is best known for collaborating with Ye on ‘Brand New’ from his 2006 album,Blue Collar. The project was released on Mark Ronson’s Allido Records label and included work from Q-Tip, Wu-Tang Clan’s Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Just Blaze, and No ID.\nRhymefest famously appeared in Kanye’s 2022 Netflix docu-series,Jeen-Yuhs. In one clip, he argues with Kanye, questioning, “Who are you to call yourself a genius?” He explains that “genius is something you have to earn,” but Ye disagrees.\nHis work with Kanye West dates back to 2004’sThe College Dropoutas a writer for his hit single ‘Jesus Walks’. The song peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won ‘Best Rap Song’ at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. He also has songwriting credits on ‘New Slaves’, ‘Hold My Liquor’, ‘I Am a God’ and ‘On Sight’ from 2013’sYeezusalbum, and ‘Praise God’ from 2021’sDonda.\nStill, Rhymefest claims he’s written many more of Kanye’s songs without receiving any credit. During an interview withThe Daily Beastin 2015, he said, “I’ve written for all of Kanye’s albums with the exception of808s & Heartbreak. There are a lot of songs that my name isn’t even on.”\nIn another conversation withHipHopDX, he spoke on the impact ‘Jesus Walks’ had on Ye’s career. “When you do great things, you know it. Whenever you make a song, you know when it’s special,” he explained. “After it was made, we knew it was special. Looking back on it, we would not view Kanye the same way without it.\n“Kanye would not have as many chances with the public as he has had without that critical piece of the puzzle. It touched people in a place where rap music rarely touches people these days, and that’s the heart.”\nPart of the reason he believes Kanye West took a backseat in writing is because of how busy he is with other avenues of his career. “I think sometimes people get to a point where they’re so busy—’I’m doing fashion, I’m doing this, I’m doing that’—that you lose focus with the foundation of what it is,” he said. “We have so many things… we lose track of the fact that it wasn’t about the things. You shouldn’t be trying to keep the things, you should be trying to make new things.”\nRhymefest found it challenging to go from being unable to pay his bills to visiting friends with multi-million dollar mansions. “It does kind of bother me that I go to my friends’ $20 million houses, and last year I was trying to figure out how to pay my mortgage,” he revealed.\n“It’s not their fault, totally. When you look at the way artists get paid now, streaming has decimated the income of the writer, so the writer doesn’t really have a career anymore. My ASCAP royalty checks went from a lot to almost nothing.”",

        "description": "Hip-hop has seen some legendary beefs and some not-so-epic face-offs. However, many clashes have just been weird, and in the early 2000s, the old school met the new school whenNellyfound himself facing off against KRS-One.\nKRS-One was involved in one ofthe first big hip-hop battles, ‘The Bridge War’against MC Shan of the Juice Crew. As part of Boogie Down Productions (BDP), the Bronx lyricist challenged the entire neighbourhood of Queensbridge and put himself in the firing line.\nStill, he is respected in hip-hop as a formidable rapper who has been involved in the culture since its early days. However, he is also known as a hip-hop purist who has a particular disdain for where the culture went in the late ’90s and 2000s.\nAs such, it is unsurprising that KRS found himself in a bizarre back-and-forth with Nelly during Nelly’s prime. Following the release of his debut album,Country Grammar,in 2000, Nelly was one of the biggest rap stars in the world and sold nine million copies after just one album.\nIn 2002, Nelly released his sophomore project,Nellyville,which featuredhits such as ‘Hot In Herre’ and ‘Flap Your Wings’. That said, the same year the St Louis emcee released a diamond-certified album, KRS-One spoke out about the commercialisation of rap music on the song ‘Clear Em Out’ from the compilationThe Difference.\nOn the song, KRS raps, “You tired of me saying what’s real hip-hop/ Well I’m tired of you biting my sh-t to go pop” adding, “Sales don’t make you the authority/ It only means you sold out to the white majority.”\nNelly noticed the jab and took great offence at the song. As such, he released ‘#1’ from the Training Day soundtrack, on which he insisted he hadn’t sold out. However, in anMTV Newsinterview, KRS-One insisted he wasn’t talking about Nelly, stating, “I have 16 years of history in hip-hop! When I diss somebody, I say the [rapper’s] name, the name of the crew and possibly the label, and we go all at it. Every battle rhyme I put out, that was my basic stance.”\nStill, Nelly responded directly to KRS-One on Freeway’s ‘Roc the Mic’ remix where he spelt out his rival’s name letter-by-letter, rhyming, “I strike a nerve in old MC’s wanting a comeback / I got the strength that he’s lost and that’s fact / Like K – ‘Know’ one here even said your name / R – You really feeling guilty bout something mayn / S – Sad to see you really just want just / One – more hit please please!/You the first old man should get a rapper’s pension / No hits since the cordless mic invention.”\nKRS responded by calling for a boycott of Nelly’s album,Nellyville, which was scheduled to drop that summer, and declared himself a “sovereign power” during anMTV Newsinterview about Nelly, asserting, “Nelly challenged a sovereign power!”\nHe continued, “The MC part of it, I can slap him around for days. I got joints for days!” KRS also released the diss track, ‘Ova Here’, where he says Nelly “sounds like an NSYNC commercial.”\nDespite being a battle, the beef was slightly ridiculous. KRS-One is many years older than Nelly, and it seemed strange that someone ruling the charts would reply to an artist who hadn’t had a hit since the 1980s.\nDespite being a battle, the beef was slightly ridiculous.

Furthermore, it seemed pointless as battling was nothing but a distraction for Nelly.\nAlthough it was funny, the feud was boring to many and seemed futile to many.",

        "title": "How The Game ruined his own career",
        "description": "Kendrick Lamar’s victory as a West Coast emcee in recent years has shown that California boasts a wealth of musical talent. With the help ofDr Dreand TDE boss Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, Lamar has become one of the most prominent artists and has kept his relationship with both intact.\nHowever, one lyricist couldn’t make this kind of journey — The Game. The irrelevance of The Game in recent years speaks volumes about how far he has fallen in the eyes of his peers and his mentor, Dr Dre. By judging The Game on his antics over the past few years, you could be forgiven for forgetting just how pivotal he was for West Coast rap in the post-Death Row era.\nStill, back in 2005, The Game nearly single-handedly resurrected the coast. With a five-times platinum, critically acclaimed album,The Documentary,the emcee undoubtedly produced one of the best hip-hop projects of the 2000s.\nEssentially if the mission was to bring LA rap nack to the forefront it was a flawless victory. But things went wrong, very wrong and today it seems The Game is a rapper Dr Dre would like to erase from his legacy. So how did a rapper who was capable of so much musically and culturally end up snubbed and shunned by the man who gave him a shot and launched his career.\nAfter handing him a joint venture record deal in 2003 with Interscope and Aftermath Records, Dr. Dre equipped The Game with every tool he needed to succeed. With a co-sign from Dr Dre, a star-studded album and a brief but impactful alliance with G-unit The Game’s debut album,The Documentary,was destined to be a success.\nAt this point, Aftermath and its signees seemed ready to take over the industry together. But The Game’s relationship with 50 Cent suddenly took a turn. As such, after a very public beef, it significantly strained ‘The Dream’ rhymer’s relationship with Dre. With millions of dollars at stake,The Chroniccreator had to make a business decision.\nIn an interview withVlad TV,The Game described Dr Dre’s decision as a financial move, disclosing that “Financially and infrastructurally, [Dr Dre] had to take sides with who Jimmy took sides with, which was 50 Cent!” He added, “It made sense because that’s where the bulk of the money was being made, and so at that point, you didn’t want to piss 50 Cent off because he was the breadwinner.”\nStill, byreleasingThe Doctor’s Advocateonly one year after his debut, he game did the near impossible by proving to the world he could still deliver a stellar album without Dre’s guiding hand or 50 Cent giving him a whole host of hooks.\nTo the surprise of many, even in 2011, when The Game releasedThe Red Album,Dre Dre still gave him vital feedback about his work, suggesting they had a good relationship. Explaining his correspondence with Dre to DJ Vlad, The Game once unveiled, “Just because Dre wasn’t on the production side of my third album doesn’t mean that I didn’t talk to Dre!”\nHowever, as the years went on, The Game showed his unprofessionalism on social media and in interviews where he couldn’t resist talking about Dre and Jimmy Iovine. During an appearance onI Am Athlete,the Compton native even blasted Dre for including Eminem and 50 Cent in his 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show, asserting it should have had strictly West Coast artists.\nIn an interview withUproxx,the ‘Hate It Or Love It’ lyricisteven tried to discredit Dr Dre’s impact on his career, stating, “Dre didn’t do aunty beats onThe Documentary,but I didn’t say he didn’t oversee it, you would want Dre to oversee anything because he’s a mastermind at that. But as fast as lie doing a beat forThe Documentary.No. I’ve never had a Dre beat in my career. He then maligned Eminem and Snoop Dogg, adding, “I have never had a song with Dre on it, and Dre is in my music video. Snoop has a ton. Em has a ton. I don’t have none!”",

        "title": "Explaining Missy Elliott’s backwards ‘Work It’ verse",
        "description": "Missy Elliottis one of hip hop’s most cherished female MCs. Rising to prominence by the side of Timbaland in the mid-1990s, the rapper is loved for her funny lyrics, provocative raps and outlandish music videos that leave her listeners mindblown. Known as one of hip hop’s first mainstream female MCs, Missy is definitely one of the greats.\nHowever, her career would not begin properly until her partnership with Timbaland. The two made music by working behind the scenes, writing and producing for R’n’B acts, such as Aaliyah, SWV, and Total. In 1997, Elliott released herdebut album,Supa Dupa Fly,and her career skyrocketed.\nElliott’s first album would spawn her first top 20 hit, ‘Sock It 2 Me’. The album landed at number three on the Billboard 200, becoming the highest-charting debut LP for a female rapper. Continuing to work alongside her good friend Timbaland, Elliot would release her second record,Da Real World, in 1999, and by 2000, the album was quickly certified platinum by the RIAA.\nIn less than a decade, Missy Elliott became one of the greats of hip-hop and was integral in legitimising female rap alongside the likes of Queen Latifah and Lil’ Kim. That said, she released some seminal tracks at the turn of the millennium. From ‘Supa Dupa Fly’ to ‘I’m Really Hot’, it is indisputable that she has put out a lot of music.\nStill, one of her biggest anthems was ‘Work It’. Releasedas a single for her 2002 albumUnder Construction,it debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and became three times platinum. The beat (produced by Timbaland) sampled Run-DMC’s ‘Peter Piper’ and Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three’s ‘Request Line’.\nStill, one part of the track became iconic: the reverse vocal in the chorus section. For years, people didn’t know what the Virginia native was saying, and many believed she might have been saying something explicit, as parts of the track are quite cheeky. However, that couldn’t be further from the truth.\nIn fact, the addition of the reverse vocal was a complete accident. During an interview, Missy Elliott revealed that the quirky element resulted from an accident by the audio engineer she was working with. Opening up to theAssociated Press,Elliott explained how it materialised, beginning, “The reverse thing, that was a mistake.”\nShe continued, “The engineer happened to hit something, and it just went backwards, and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of crazy’ because it went backwards on the beat. So after that happened, I said, ‘Yo, keep that in there, and I’m going to write around it.”\nMissy Elliott was surprised at people’s assumptions about what she was potentially saying and revealed, “They thought I was saying all kinds of nasty stuff,” Elliott said. “No, actually, I’m not this time.”\nThe actual phrase that Missy Elliott rapped in her reverse section is identical to the line that precedes it: “Put my thing down flip it, and reverse it.” As such, it’s supposedly meant to come out as Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup.”\nAlthough it was not dirty, for some years, fans were under the assumption it was Missy Elliott asking, “Is your p*ssy getting wet yet?” However, she has debunked this several times now. The reverse section is the most iconic part of ‘Work It’. In fact, it’s so recognisable that Elliott recreated a backwards section at a later part of the song.",

        "title": "The reason why Chance The Rapper quit acid: “I’m done with this”",
        "description": "Chance The Rappermade his breakthrough in 2013 withAcid Rap. The mixtape was inspired by and even named after acid, but shortly after the project came out, he was done with taking the psychedelic drug.\nWith the tape, the Chicago rapper took the hip-hop world by storm alongside guests such as Childish Gambino, Twista, Action Bronson, Ab-Soul, BJ The Chicago Kid, Vic Mensa, Saba, and Noname. Chance believes he was in his own lane when it came to rapping about LSD rather than weed, although he never wanted to glorify the drug.\n“I thinkAcid Rapwas a good example of me just trusting myself and being OK with being who I was,” he toldComplex. “I don’t ever want to sound like I’m taking credit for shit, but druggie culture, like n*ggas rapping about doing LSD and other shit that wasn’t weed, was not happening in 2012. So in 2013, coming out with thisAcid Rapproject, n*ggas were calling me a weirdo and all types of shit.”\nHe continued, “I had to deal with that and also realise that my projects described experiences that I had already been through. But they were not the sum of me or the whole exploration of who I am as a person.”\nChance decided to quit acid following the release ofAcid Rapdue to the number of bad experiences he had with the drug. Despite going cold turkey, he couldn’t fully escape it due to the success of his mixtape. People would offer him acid and ask questions about it, as much as he was trying to distance himself from that lifestyle.\n“I stopped doing acid probably less than a month after the project came out,” he explained. “I was like, ‘I’m done with this,’ aftertoo many bad tripsand just weird shit happening to me. But I had to deal with it for the next year and a half. Having everybody that met me trying to either offer me acid or ask me interview questions about acid, and having to be basically the spokesperson for drugs. But I had to come to myself and realise and remember that I was not making those songs off acid.\n“I may have found some beats I liked off of acid, but it was me making the songs. And I think that was probably the key thing that I learned from that experience. It was like, you could dress up something to be one thing and draw inspiration from one thing, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s the main ingredient to it.”\nFans were attending Chance’s shows on acid and attempting to hand it to him, but he didn’t want people taking it in that environment. This is coming from someone who made and broke relationships while taking the drug, even on his own, in public.\n“Motherfuckers were giving us bags of a hundred tabs, or literal liquid acid, and we was like, ‘Just chill. It is not that serious,'” he said. “But I also understand it becauseAcid Raptook me a year to finish. And it was a lot of studio sessions where I was just listening to other people’s music off acid or traveling to other places.\n“You’re supposed to do acid either by yourself or with a group of people you trust, in a small controlled setting, and just trip and chill in that space. And I was like, shit, I’d take two or three tabs and just go downtown.”",

        "title": "The first rap album Drake ever listened to: “Mom won’t let me play it in the house”",
        "description": "Drakeis one of the most successful rappers of all time. The Toronto rapper was inspired by Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, Kanye West and even the Clipse, despite his longtime beef with Pusha T. However, he’s never really mentioned his influence from Snoop Dogg, despite one of his albums being the first rap project he ever listened to.\nDrizzy once revealed thatDoggystylewas his first taste of a hip-hop album. Released on Death Row, the 1993 classic helped put Snoop on the map. The Dr Dre-produced LP debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 806,858 copies in its first week. It also featured the hit singles ‘Who Am I? (What’s My Name?)’ and ‘Gin and Juice’.\nDrake claimed his mother never let him play the album at home. He got the chance to listen to it properly on a drive from Toronto to Memphis, when his father, Dennis Graham, let him blast it through the speakers.\n“When my dad drove me to Memphis one time from Toronto, it was a 20-something hour drive,” he said. “I brought myDoggystylecassette. I asked him, ‘Dad, can I please play this? Mom won’t let me play it in the house.’ He was like, ‘Yeah. You can play it for 20 minutes. And then we listen to an hour of my music.’\n“That was Al Green, that was the Spinners, that was Sade. That was Marvin Gaye. At the time, I was like, ‘Aw, man, come on, 20 minutes?’ But it really was pivotal for me because I started listening to the melodies and the emotion in this music that he was playing me. It grabbed me maybe even a little more than thatDoggystylecassette did. I would say that I’m more moved by melody, even though I love to rap.”\nFunnily enough, Snoop hasn’t always had the kindest words for Drake. When asked to share his thoughts on Drizzy suing Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ diss track, he replied, “No comment. On the West, we hold court in the streets.” As part of his beef with K. Dot, Drizzy even used AI-generated vocals to sound like Snoop on ‘Taylor Made Freestyle‘.\nDrake previously opened up about his influence from Lil Wayne, whose Young Money label he signed to, and Jay-Z, during an interview withCNNin 2010. “One of my biggest influences ended up being a close friend of mine which is Jay-Z,” he said. “Lil Wayne, who is actually responsible for my career has always been a huge influence to me and one of my heroes.”\nAside from musicians, he also explained how vital females are in his life. “I’m inspired by the woman,” he admitted. “I’m inspired by the makeup of a woman. Their mind, their conversation, the emotions that they exude and pour out of them. I love women. I love to study women. I’m not a womaniser, but I love to study just behavioural patterns in women and how to interact with them.”",

        "description": "Kendrick Lamaris among the greatest rappers of all time, but not every lyric comes to him instantly. One of the most potent songs of his career sat on his hard drive for half a year because he couldn’t find inspiration for it right away.\nThe Compton rapper released hisTo Pimp a Butterflyalbum in 2015, which is often considered the best album of his career for its jazz-rap qualities. It birthed one of the biggest protest songs of the 21st century, ‘Alright’, through its association with the Black Lives Matter movement, with many people chanting the powerful lyrics through the streets.\nProduced by Pharrell, ‘Alright’ won ‘Best Rap Song’ and ‘Best Rap Performance’ at the Grammy Awards in 2016 while receiving two other nominations. A track that might appear natural to Kendrick took a while to come to mind.\n“I was sitting on that record for about six months,” he told acclaimed producer Rick Rubin forGQ. “The beat’s Pharrell. And between my guy Sam Taylor and Pharrell, they would always be like, ‘Did you do it? When you gonna do it?’ I knew it was a great record—I just was trying to find the space to approach it.\n“I mean, the beat sounds fun, but there’s something else inside ofthem chords that Pharrell put downthat feels like—it can be more of a statement rather than a tune. So with Pharrell and Sam asking me, am I gonna rock on it, when I’m gonna rock on it, it put the pressure on me to challenge myself. To actually think and focus on something that could be a staple in hip-hop.”\nHe added, “Eventually, I came across it. Eventually, I found the right words. You know, it was a lot going on, and still, to this day, it’s a lot going on. And I wanted to approach it as more uplifting—but aggressive. Not playing the victim, but still having that, ‘We strong’, you know?”\nKendrick explained that Pharrell and Taylor, an executive from Sony Music, knew the song would end up being something special long before he realised. “I didn’t have any words,” he admitted. “P knew that that record was special. Sam knew that the record was special. They probably knew it before I even had a clue.\n“So I’m glad that they put that pressure on me to challenge myself. ‘Cause sometimes, as a writer, you can have that writer’s block. And when you like a sound or an instrumental, you want to approach it the right way. So you sit on it. I remember hitting P on a text like, ‘Man, I got the lyrics.’ And typing the lyrics to him. He’s like, ‘That’s it.'”\nThe inspiration for the song started withPharrell’s lyricson the hook. “P had the‘alright.’ That’s him on the hook. And just saying the ‘alright’ phrase—what does, ‘We are gonna be alright’ represent?” he said. “I’m glad that sparked the idea, ’cause that song coulda went a thousand other ways.”\n‘Alright’ has amassed over 906 million streams on Spotify, and the equally powerful music video has 187 million YouTube views. 10 years after its release, the song stands the test of time and remains a standout in Kendrick’s catalogue.",

        "description": "Ed Sheeran has been around many rappers throughout his career. His early days saw him collaborating with grime MCs such as JME, Ghetts, Wiley, Devlin, and P Money, before going across the pond to work with giants such as Eminem, 50 Cent, Travis Scott and Cardi B. He’s also worked extensively withThe Game, resulting in a memorable weed experience.\nThe singer’s relationship with the Compton rapper began after the release of hisJesus Piecealbum in 2013. During a studio session one time, Ed got so high that he had to leave the room and head home to recover.\n“I remember I was in the studio once in, like 2013,” he said on theFitzy & Wippapodcast. “I was doing some records with The Game and he took me to Compton. And we were in the studio and we probably made like 13, 14 songs. And towards the end of the session his boys come in and they’re sort of like, it starts being a bit of a party.\n“And I’m like, ‘Ah, do you know what? I’m in Compton. I’m with The Game.’ I took a tiny, tiny, tiny puff on something and I was out. I was like, ‘I have to go home.’ This is like 2013 though. I don’t really do that at all. When in Rome, [right]?”\nThe Game and Ed Sheeran’s time in the studio wasn’t just a one-and-done type of thing. The pair were working on a collaborative album scheduled to arrive by 2015, but the project was never released.\n“I’m working on a joint album with Ed Sheeran that we trying to drop probably end of the year, beginning of 2015,” Game said in 2014. “That is gonna be crazy. It happened with a tweet. He tweeted something aboutJesus Piece,I responded, we exchanged numbers on the DM, and then we got in the studio. We were just planning to record one song; we ended up doing like seven.\n“Ed came up with the idea to start working on a joint album, and we started doing it. That was like in five hours. We was just going. He was on that guitar. Acoustically, he’s a genius, man, so when he does that, what comes out of me is songs like ‘Dreams’ and ‘Hate It or Love It’ and ‘My Life.’ The songs that we got, they’re real songs. And I can’t wait for people to hear ’em.”\nNot only were they planning a whole body of work, but it was even going to be a double album. “It’s gonna be two different sides. So it’ll be two CDs,” he said. “It’ll be the way I would do an album, with his help, and the way he would do an album with my features.”\nDespite the album never dropping, they did join forces on ‘Roadside’ and ‘City of Sin’ on The Game’s 2019 album,Born 2 Rap. Hopefully, the rest of their unreleased tracks will one day make their way to fans.",

        "description": "Even when someone is at the top of their profession, it doesn’t necessarily mean their job means everything to them. Arsenal star Ben White once admitted he doesn’t watch football, despite playing in the Premier League. Former Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto said he only plays football for an income, stating it wasn’t his passion.MF DOOMis one of the best MCs to ever touch a mic, but similarly, hip-hop didn’t consume him.\nThe London-born artist made a career out of carefully crafted rhymes that set him worlds apart from most other rappers. He did so while shielding his identity with a signature mask that only added to his persona as a supervillain.\nDOOM, who passed away in 2020, was always a fan of rapping, make no mistake about it. But he wouldn’t partake in hip-hop if it weren’t for profit. Once he realised he could make a career out of his witty bars, there was no going back. Hip-hop, however, was never part of his life outside the studio and stage.\n“I would go to work and do the work,” MF DOOM admitted. “I don’t really do music at home. We listened to music, but I do that shit just to get money. I write rhymes and shit to get money. Other than that I don’t listen to hip-hop music. I listen tojazz musicand instrumentals and shit like that. I only do this for the simple fact of points-per-rhyme, the point game.\n“It seems to be a profitable thing these days, and nobody else is really paying attention to it. You can be about your points, and if nobody else can do it, you can get some change off that joint, because you’re the only one doing it like that. That’s what I get out of the rhyming.”\nDOOM was initially unaware of how far his lyrics could take him. Rapping was just something he did for fun, putting words together in a similar way to Scrabble. Before he knew it, he was spitting over beats and turning a pastime into his full-time job.\n“I didn’t know it was gonna be such a popular thing,” he said. “It’s something we used to do for a side hobby, to keep your mind fresh. Word games. You might be walking down the street, playing with words in your mind, so you throw them back and forth, andwords that rhyme just come to you. It’s something we did as a hobby, like practicing thoughts, brain exercises. Word searches and things like that, studying different languages, where words come from.\n“A practice to keep your mind sharp, is how we used to see it. But then it turned out to be something—if you put it to music, in a rhythmic way, and you know how to bring the point across, then you can turn it to something that’s real profitable. I’m blessed to be part of this whole thing, from this hip-hop experience.”\nWhen someone is that good at their craft, who are we to judge their approach? Especially when they’ve provided timeless material for decades. MF DOOM’s life was cut short, but his musical legacy will live forever.",

        "description": "Eminemhas inspired a whole generation of kids and some of today’s biggest rappers. The Detroit rapper was once a rookie himself and relied on advice from his heroes along the way, and one thing stood out to him above all.\nThe legendary Elton John, alongtime friend and collaboratorof Slim Shady, sat down with Em before releasing hisRevivalalbum in 2017. During their conversation, the British icon asked him about the best advice he’s ever received.\n“I would have to say Dre,” he told Elton forInterview Magazine. “Actually, he gave me a couple of pieces of advice. When I first got signed to Aftermath, we had many discussions about how I wanted to bring in my group D12 and put them on right away.\n“Dre said, “You’ve gotta build your house before you can let your friends come in,” and it made so much sense to me. In hindsight, waiting was probably better because eventually we got Shady Records and were able to sign them to it. He also used to say, ‘It can be in bad taste as long as it don’t taste bad.'”\nWhen Elton asked if Dre was “a bit like Obi-Wan Kenobi,” he agreed, before recalling some other notable advice. “I also just remembered someadvice that Rick Rubin gave me,” he said. “We were talking about a song or something, and he said, ‘I don’t really consider myself smart enough to know what everybody’s going to think, so I just do what feels right to me.’”\nIt doesn’t come as much of a surprise that Dre gave him the most memorable advice. Although Eminem has never been outspoken on social media, he’s remained in the spotlight for his music—something he also learnt from Dre.\n“I studied Dre a lot,” he said. “I don’t know if you’d call it a mantra or what, but he believed that if you never go away, it’s hard for someone to miss you. And I realise that some people see going away as, ‘Oh, he’s irrelevant now,’ but I feel like if I don’t go away, I get sick of myself. It’s never been my thing to be in the spotlight all the time.”\nDre has been his biggest influence since the early days, when he dropped his major label debut,The Slim Shady LP, in 1999. Released on the NWA member’s Aftermath label, Eminem did everything he could to impress him during the recording sessions.\n“I remember one of the first times I went out to LA,” he recalled. “I met Dre and Jimmy [Iovine] at Interscope, and it felt so ridiculous and so far-fetched that this was happening. When Dre walked in, it was like an out-of-body experience. Nothing in my life had been going right for me, but he put me up in the Oakwood apartments and paid my rent so I could record with him.\n“There was a period when I stayed up writing for 48 hours straight and ended up crashing at, like, six in the morning. I wanted to be prepared for Dre because I thought, ‘If I’m not ready for every aspect of this, this could be it for me.'”",

        "description": "Mike Tyson may be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, but it didn’t stopThe LOXfrom almost fighting him. Jadakiss, Styles P and Sheek Louch were once at an awards show with fellow Ruff Ryders artist Eve, best known for her 2001 hit ‘Let Me Blow Your Mind’ with Gwen Stefani.\nEve was hot property at the time. Her debut album,Let There Be Eve… Ruff Ryders’ First Ladyreached number one on the Billboard 200 in 1999, becoming the first female rapper to achieve that feat. Her following two albums,ScorpionandEve-Olution, reached number four and six, respectively.\nTyson allegedly approached Eve at the event and expressed an interest in her, prompting the hip-hop trio to enter protection mode. During an episode of theHotboxin’ with Mike Tysonpodcast, Styles P recalled the incident and revealed he was carrying a knife at the time.\n“Vegas or LA, it’s one of them awards,” he said. “We see Mike, we’re chilling. Eve is with us, though — us three, there’s nobody else there. And [Mike’s] on his bully, and we decided, ‘We gotta protect Eve.’ We was deciding who was gonna get knocked out. I was like, ‘I got a knife. Mike’s gonna kill us!’\n“He just liked Eve for how she was looking.Eve was nervous. We with Eve so gotta be the protectors, so now we in a fucked up position. Now we deciding who’s gonna take the Mike blow. We decided Louch. Louch was like, ‘Fuck no!’ I’m like, ‘I’ma die! I’m little!’ Nobody can take this blow. We trying to come up with a strategy. What do you do?”\nHowever, Styles said the situation never escalated to the point where any actions were taken. “Mike loves us,” he said. “We’re The LOX, we’re his little bros. We got rapport, we hang out, we chill, we smoke weed, all that. That’s big bro! He had genuine love for us, treated us, lined us up with a few bags, so it was awesome.”\nAs for Tyson, he claimed he cleared the air with Eve. “I didn’t mean that, Eve,” he said. “Me and Eve, we made amends. I said sorry. That’s all I care about.” In her memoir,Who’s That Girl, Eve admitted she was “noticeably uncomfortable” when Tyson was “talking to me crazy.”\nJadakiss once claimed Tyson was sexually explicit when he spoke to Eve. “Mike told Eve, ‘Eve, I’ll fuck the shit outta you,’” he said onDrink Champs. “Me personally, I was on the floor … A regular Joe Shmoe, his head would’ve been off. Mike? ‘Eve, you gotta hold that one.’”\nThe LOX and Eve have collaborated many times throughout their careers. The group featured on ‘Scenario 2000’ fromLet There Be Eve… Ruff Ryders’ First Ladyin 1999, followed by ‘Thug in the Street’ from 2001’sScorpion. Eve also featured on several tracks from LOX’s 2000 albumWe Are the Streets, including ‘Recognize’, ‘Ryde or Die, Bitch’, ‘U Told Me’ and ‘If U Know’.",

        "title": "Jay-Z explains how Nirvana impacted hip-hop: “We had to wait for a second”",
        "description": "Nirvana are one of the most iconic bands of all time. Between 1989 and 1993, the group released three albums, includingNevermind, which is often considered among the best LPs ever. The band, led by late singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain, significantly impacted the music industry, whichJay-Zrecognised from afar.\nIn Pharrell’s 2012 book,Places and Spaces I’ve Been, Jay opened up about the grunge band having such a big influence on popular culture that it made hip-hop take a backseat. Around the time ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ was a success, Hov claimed hip-hop was on an upward trajectory, but Nirvana’s sheer force put a spanner in the works.\n“First, we got to go back to before grunge and why grunge happened,” he said. “‘Hair bands’ dominated the airwaves, and rock became more about looks than about actual substance and what it stood for—the rebellious spirit of youth. That’s why ‘Teen Spirit’ rang so loud because it was right on point with how everyone felt, you know what I’m saying?\n“It was weird because hip-hop was becoming this force, then grunge music stopped it for one second, ya know? Those ‘hair bands’ were too easy for us to take out; when Kurt Cobain came with that statement, it was like, ‘We got to wait awhile.’”\nJay credited Cobain with demanding attention for his talent and making himself an impossible figure to ignore. Once they had their moment, he explained thathip-hop was able to growand become the successful genre it is today.\n“I have always been a person who was curious about the music and when those forces come on the scene, they are inescapable. Can’t take your eyes off them, can’t stop listening to them,” he told Pharrell. “[Cobain] was one of those figures. I knew we had to wait for a second before we became that dominant force in music.”\nJay-Z interpolated a Nirvana song for his 2013 albumMagna Carta Holy Grail. On the track ‘Holy Grail’, featuring Justin Timberlake, he takes lyrics from ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ from the classicNevermindalbum.\nIn the pre-chorus, Timberlake sings, “And we all just entertainers/ And we’re stupid and contagious/ And we all just entertainers,” instead of, “With the lights out, it’s less dangerous/ Here we are now, entertain us/ I feel stupid and contagious/ Here we are now, entertain us.”\nCobain’s widow, Courtney Love, permitted Jay to use the lyrics. She said toHuffPost, “I’m letting Jay-Z use lyrics – [my daughter] Francis would freak [if she knew this,]” she said. “Jay-Z’s huge and we’re friends. I mean, we’re not besties or anything. They [used it] without asking, which is kind of nervy, but the business side has been taken care of, so it’s fine.”\n‘Holy Grail’ was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and seven on the UK Singles Chart. The song has over 358 million streams on Spotify and a music video with over 10 million views on YouTube.",

        "title": "The Kanye West album Kanye West hates: “I made it out of fear”",
        "description": "Kanye Westgoing against popular opinion is nothing new. He’s always striving for originality in his music, clothing or anything he puts his mind to, no matter how much backlash he might receive. His music catalogue between 2004 and 2003 is considered one of the best runs in hip-hop, with many consideringMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasyas the best of the bunch. But in Kanye’s mind, not so much.\nDark Twisted Fantasywas released in 2010 off the back of the controversy he received for interrupting Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards in defence of Beyoncé. Recorded in exile in Hawaii, it’s often seen as the best of everything Ye has to offer, from his raps to production to guest appearances. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, boastingfeatures from Nicki Minaj, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Elton John, Rick Ross, Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, and others.\nHowever, Kanye has gone as far as admitting he “hates” the album. Taking to social media in 2025, he said, “I hateMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Like haaaaaaate that album. I madeDark Fantasyout of fear and to prove something. It was like ‘coming back from the Taylor Swift moment’. I should have leaned in more.”\nHe added, “The Life of Pablois waaaay better thanMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Go song for song.” Despite his negativity, Ye did praise a couple of tracks: “Songs I love onDark Fantasyare: ‘Devil in a New Dress’, ‘Blame Game’.”\nThis isn’t the only time Kanye’s spoken down onMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. On another occasion, he claimed even more albums were superior and singled out a track he believed wasn’t pushing boundaries. “So many people rateMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasyas one of the best albums. [But]Yeezusand808s & Heartbreakare so much better and stronger,” he toldSHOWstudio. “Dark Fantasyis almost like an apology record. ‘Power’ was the least progressive song that I ever had as a first single.\n“It was like me going back and spending six dedicated months – it took over two years to release the album – but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me, to make an entire bouquet that they loved, that was the most listenable, that was the least challenging.”\nKanye also comparedMy Beautiful Dark Twisted FantasytoThanksgiving dinnerin terms of giving fans something they’re comfortable with. “People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner,” he said. “And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for? And it’s great, you don’t want anybody changing things on Thanksgiving dinner.”\nHe continued, “But you take808sorYeezus, where these albums got completely panned when they came out, and then you see how they end up influencing things.” On the other hand, Paul McCartney once revealed his love ofMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, tellingDIY Magazine, “That was the record of his that I really envied. I thought, ‘Oh, he’s done some good stuff.’”",

        "title": "The one person Eminem hates more than any other: “He makes my blood boil”",
        "description": "Eminemisn’t afraid to say what’s on his mind. From violent lyrics to dissing people like Mariah Carey and Machine Gun Kelly, the Detroit rapper has built an identity around his fearlessness and not caring about what anyone thinks of him. That also applies to the president of the United States.\nSlim Shady has been outspoken about Donald Trump since his first presidential bid, which saw him in the White House between 2017 and 2021. These days, the businessman and media personality turned politician is back in office, continuing to cause controversy for the same reasons.\nDuring an interview withVulturein 2017, Em revealed his hatred for Trump. “He makes my blood boil,” he said. “I can’t even watch the news anymore because it makes me too stressed out. All jokes aside, all punch lines aside, I’m trying to get a message out there about him. I want our country to be great too, I want it to be the best it can be, but it’s not going to be that with him in charge.\n“I remember when he was first sniffing around politics, I thought, ‘We’ve tried everything else, why not him?’ Then — and I was watching it live — he had that speech where he said Mexico is sending us rapists and criminals. I got this feeling of, ‘What the fuck?’ From that point on, I knew it was going to be bad with him. What he’s doing putting people against each other is scary fucking shit. His election was such a disappointment to me about the state of the country.”\nEminem called Trump a “bitch” on Big Sean’s ‘No Favors’ from hisI Decidedalbum in 2017. He rapped in the song, “I’m anti, can’t no government handle a commando/ Your man don’t want it, Trump’s a bitch/ I’ll make his whole brand go under.” That’s just the tip of the iceberg regarding his public disapproval.\nWhile performing in Glasgow that same year, hedissed him againby saying “motherfuck Donald Trump” on stage. “Scotland might have to be our new home because right now shit ain’t going so well in the States,” he said. “And I just want to take this moment right now to say motherfuck Donald Trump.”\nWith his lyrics, Eminem has been trying to get a response from Trump and is more than prepared for that scenario. “It’s not so much about him hearing something I have to say, because there’s nothing I’m saying about him onRevivalthat he doesn’t already know about himself,” he said. “It’s more that I want him to answer me because I got ideas for all kinds of shit to say back to him if he does.\n“I’m not going to give any away now, but I’ve got lines ready if he says something about me. I get almost flustered thinking about him — that’s how angry he makes me. The people that support him are the people he cares about the least and they don’t even realise it.”",

        "title": "‘Wah Gwan Delilah’: The most tragic song Drake has ever recorded",
        "description": "Drakehas undoubtedly produced some exceptional songs during his career. Whether it’s ‘Hotline Bling’ or ‘God’s Plan,’ people cannot deny the pure excellence of his discography. However, many have seen the quality of his work decline rapidly in recent years, and although some songs may be considered bad or subpar, others are simply garbage.\nDrizzy’s 2023 projectFor All The Dogselicited some harsh critiques,and frankly, much of it was warranted. Still, irrespective of the album’s poor reception, many were still willing to see it as a blip, a mere mistake in an otherwise flawless catalogue. However, others were more critical and saw it as a symptom of a more significant problem and began to see a more damning pattern.\nMany have argued thatsince the release ofScorpionin 2018,which included hits such as ‘God’s Plan’ and ‘In My Feelings’, Drizzy’s albums have worsened, with each project being more disappointing than the last. Furthermore, the industry has subtly confirmed this as the record sales and chart positions reflect this timeline of decay.\nStill, nothing reflects this more than ‘Wah Gwan Delilah’. In hip-hop, you win and lose battles, which has been a part of the culture for many decades. However, Drizzy’s response, which is still playing out, has been an eye-opener for the culture. The Toronto native hasn’t just responded with a lawsuit, accusing Universal Music Group (UMG) of defamation, but shortly after his loss, the emcee decided to team up with Canadian artist Snowd4y for ‘Wah Gwan Delilah’.\nThe track was initially released through SoundCloud, and many assumed, due to its low quality, that it was an AI-generated song, asserting that it was too silly and ridiculous to be an actual release. However, shortly after, it was confirmed that the song was an unofficial release authorised by Drake and put out with his blessing.\nThe song is a parody of a 2005 song from Plain White T’s but hears Drake attempt to use Jamaican patois as he sings in a horrifically nasal fashion over an acoustic guitar with an ear-piercing amount of autotune. As streamers and cultural commentators reacted to the track, many concluded that the musician was having some kind of mental breakdown.\nNobody will ever know Drake’s intent when recording the song, but the mere fact that he did concerns many. Some responded by saying he was trying to troll the industry and the culture after losing to Kendrick Lamar in a rap battle. However, it wasn’t aimed at Lamar and didn’t make anyone except himself look bad.\nIt was a tragedy on so many levels and made actual Drizzy fans begin to mourn the loss of a once-great artist. The sentiment in hip-hop was one of pity for the artist. Following the song’s release, he was simultaneously appearing at events, making rants about having no friends, playing Beyoncé and then began jumping on streams calling hip-hop “weird”.\nInternet users have described it as “crappily produced” and packed “with awful fake patois” which it is but, as far as Drizzy goes, it is the most tragic song he has ever recorded to date and is arguably one of the most tragic tracks ever made by a hip-hop emcee since the genre was created.",

        "title": "‘The Box’: The song that made Roddy Ricch a star",
        "description": "Roddy Ricchhas been making music since the middle of the 2010s when he was just a teenager, but his passion for music began way before that. The Compton rapper, born Rodrick Wayne Moore Jr., started rapping at eight and continued to spit bars throughout his school years. In addition to lyrics, he was also making beats at 16.\nIn 2015, he released his first song, ‘Cuz I’m On’, before dropping his debut mixtape,Feed Tha Streets, in 2017. The following year, he released the sequel,Feed Tha Streets II, which featured his popular songs, ‘Die Young’ and ‘Every Season’.\nHe landed a major break in 2019 by guesting on Nipsey Hussle’s ‘Racks in the Middle’, produced by Hit-Boy, which served as thelast song Nipsey releasedbefore his death. The song reached number 26 on the Hot 100 and won Best Rap Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, while also being nominated for Best Rap Song.\nThat same year, he also found success as a featured artist on Mustard’s ‘Ballin’. The song, which appeared on Mustard’sPerfect Tenalbum, climbed even higher to number 11 on the Hot 100 and also received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Performance at the Grammys.\nRoddy probably thought he had hit the jackpot already, but the best was yet to come. He signed to Atlantic Records for the release of his debut album,Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial, which dropped in December 2019. He shared several singles, ‘Big Stepper’, ‘Start Wit Me’ and ‘Tip Toe’, leading up to the project, but those tracks didn’t even come close to the success of ‘The Box’ – the song thatchanged everything for him.\n‘The Box’ spent an impressive 11 weeks at number one on the Hot 100, receiving nominations for Best Rap Song, Best Melodic Rap Performance and Song of the Year at the 2021 Grammy Awards. Roddy raps on the catchy hook, “I just hit a lick with the box/ Had to put the stick in the box.” Much of its success has been credited to the “eee err” sound heard throughout the song, which helped it go viral across social media. While it may sound like something crafted by the producer, the sound is actually Roddy himself.\n“Anybody who listens to music knows it’s his voice,” producer 30 Roc toldHipHopDX. “That’s not possible. It’s possible for me to do that, but if I was to put that in the beat without him laying the vocals, I felt like it would throw the beat off. I’m happy that he actually did that instead of us actually adding a chant before the vocals. It’s so crazy to me. I have real producers that be asking me, ‘Is this a part of your beat?’ And I’m like, ‘Dude, you can tell this is Roddy’s voice.’ If you really listen to it, it’s definitely Roddy’s voice.”\n‘The Box’ came to life in New York City, recorded in just 15 minutes at the end of an all-night studio session. If only he had known what would happen to his world after coming up with that idea in the early morning hours.\nWhile Roddy has struggled to find the same success since, with songs like ‘High Fashion’ and ‘Late at Night’ only breaking number 20 on the Hot 100, he’s still certified himself as a force of the 2020s. Roc claimed he knew ‘The Box’ would “change both of our lives” simply from listening to the beat, and his intuition was strong.",

        "title": "The five scariest rap verses in hip-hop history",
        "description": "Hip-hopgives rappers the platform to spill their guts, be it threatening lyrics or candid thoughts about suicide. A combination of these things have resulted in some of the most shocking and memorable moments in music history.\nWhether it’s attacking other artists in the industry, venting over troubles with a significant or drunkenly opening up about dark thoughts, we’ve seen it all over the years. More than ever, rappers are feeling more comfortable about laying it all on the floor.\nFrom Ice Cube letting off steam in the 1990s to Tyler, The Creator introducing the world to his graphic lyrics, fans have been taken on whirlwind of horror throughout each decade; no matter how controversial the content might be.\nWith Halloween just around the corner, we take a look at five of the scariest rap verses in the history of the genre.\nTyler, The Creatorput his twisted mind on display from the get-go with the menacing ‘Yonkers’. Through violent wordplay and disses, the Odd Future leader paints a brutal picture of putting an end to pop music, complete with suicidal lyrics. The track may end with death, but the second verse targeted at Paramore’s Hayley Williams, B.o.B and Bruno Mars is one of the key reasons it was met with so much controversy.\nScariest lyric: “(What you think of Hayley Williams?)/ Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin’ them/ I’ll crash that fuckin’ airplane that that f-ggot n-gga B.o.B is in/ And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus/ And won’t stop until the cops come in.”\n‘Kim’ was the product ofEminembreaking up with Kim Mathers and being inspired by a movie he watched. Instead of writing a cheesy love song, he decided to pour out his frustration with angry lyrics about splitting amid having a daughter together. He knew it was a “fucked-up” track but believed it showed how much he cared about her, capturing the mood of an argument between them. The final verse was the most vivid.\nScariest lyric: “Don’t you getit, bitch? No one can hear you/ Now shut the fuck up, and get what’s comin’ to you/ You were supposed to love me/ Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!”\nThe third verse of ‘u’ finds a drunkenKendrick Lamarbattling with depression. You can hear the cracks in his voice as he spits from the perspective of a guilty conscience in his head, reluctantly welcoming listeners into his mind of mood swings and the stresses of the world. So much so that he admits to crying himself to sleep at night. It’s K.Dot at his most vulnerable, resulting in one of the most impressive moments of his career to date.\nScariest lyric: “Should’ve killed yo’ ass long time ago/ You should’ve felt that black revolver blast a long time ago/ And if these mirrors could talk it’d say, “You gotta go”/ And if I told your secrets the world’ll know money can’t stop a suicidal weakness.”\n‘Mind Playing Tricks on Me’ is arguably the most popular Hip Hop song about paranoia. In the first verse, Scarface takes fans into his dark mind of burning bodies as a result of the gangsta lifestyle, setting the tone forGeto Boys‘ Willie D and Bushwick Bill to follow suit. He doesn’t hold back, admitting the paranoia he’s dealing with has come to the point of holding a gun to his head at night.\nScariest lyric: “At night I can’t sleep, I toss and turn/ Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein’ burned/ Four walls just starin’ at a n-gga/ I’m paranoid, sleepin’ with my finger on the trigger.”\nDr Dreand Ice Cube combined in 1994 for ‘Natural Born Killaz’, reuniting for the first time since N.W.A split up. The song was intended to appear on their scrapped joint album titledHeltah Skeltah, but ended up on 1994’sMurder Was the Casesoundtrack, with the lyrics resulting in their frightening best and Cube comparing himself to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the third verse.\nScariest lyric: “He steps in the single door/ Got his ass whipped with twenty lashes like they do up in Singapore/ So I’ma pull a fuckin’ Jeffrey Dahmer/ Now he’s suicidal, just like Nirvana.”",

        "description": "Eminemis no stranger to adversity, despite being one of the most recognisable names in hip-hop and now living a very comfortable life. He reached the top of the genre; considered in the argument for the greatest of all time, but he had to claw his way there and work twice as hard as other artists.\nBorn in Illinois, but certainly a golden child of Detroit, Marshall Mathers lived his childhood in perpetual poverty. His father; Marshal Mathers Jr abandoned the family when Em was only one year old, and he was raised by his mother in a primarily black neighbourhood. He recalled his difficulty growing up toRolling Stone,detailing the beatings he would receive.\nThere was seemingly no respite for the rapper as he couldn’t escape to the safety of his home. He had an extremely difficult relationship with his mother whom he has described as having a paranoid personality. He has accused his mother in court of being a drug abuser and of subjecting him to mental and physical abuse.\nYoung Marshall finally obtained some form of direction and mentorship through his uncle, Ronnie Polkingharn. Polkinharn introduced the boy to rap by gifting him theBreakin’soundtrack that included the rap song ‘Reckless’. Following this, his uncle became a musical mentor for him as he delved deeper into the scene.\nTragedy would strike again though as in 1991 Ronnie committed suicide, leaving Em all alone once more. After the death of his father figure, Mathers didn’t speak for four days and refused to attend the funeral as he retreated back into isolation. Polkingharn’s influence did not go to waste though.\nEminem found his way out through music and, following the failure of his debut studio albumInfinite, through the development of his violent alter-ego Slim Shady. It was as Shady he released the famousSlim Shady EPin 1997. Legendary producer Dr Dre got his hands on the record and his reaction to it came in the form of a demand to Jimmy Iovine: “find him. Now”.\nIt was under Dre’s guidance that Slim would become the artist he is today as the duo ruled the airwaves in the late ‘90s and early 2000s. 1999 saw the release of his second studio albumThe Slim Shady LPand the floodgates opened as the record became one of the most popular records of the year; becoming triple platinum by year’s end.\nThe pair didn’t slow down after the success ofThe Slim Shady LPas they controlled the game from 2000 to 2004. They combined to release three albums in this time; 2000’sThe Marshall Mathers LP, 2002’sThe Eminem Showand 2004’sEncore. All three records were wildly popular with fans and critics alike. This was a sustained level of success that had never been before or since in rap.\nAll the plaudits and roses almost never came to be as one interaction early in his career sent the rapper spiralling and left him questioning whether or not to continue.\nSpeaking toXXLin 2022, Shady was detailing his rise to the top and recalled an instance in the late ‘90s that he thought would kickstart his career. He said, “we had somebody at this hip-hop label who said they wanted to sign me”. This wasn’t the case though; “I made three or four songs, and we gave it to this guy, and found out that he worked in the mail room”.\nThis was another cruel setback for the Detroit native who admitted that the ordeal had a heavy impact on him; “I was super depressed”. Luckily for him and for eventual fans, he lamented and anted up once more and pushed onwards with his dream. It feels like he was always destined for greatness, considering all Marshall’s awful experiences, he still made it to the top of the mountain.",

        "description": "Naswas ‘God’s Son’ and as the dust settled on the East Coast-West Coast battlefield, he sat atop hip-hop’s mountain of Olympus as an unchallengeable deity. That was untilJay-Zstarted taking the game seriously. Also hailing from Brooklyn, Jay had one thing on his mind: to take the mountain for himself. He had a plan; you could even say that he hadThe Blueprint.\nNasir had music in his blood;his father was jazz and blues musicianOld Dara, so it was no surprise that he took the artist’s path. The young rapper got his start through a meeting with iconic rapper and producer Large Professor, who mentored him and would often take him to the recording studio where Rakim and Kool G Rap would record.\nIt wouldn’t take long for the Brooklyn rapper to explode onto the scene, releasing his renowned debut albumIllmaticin 1994. This record was seen as a revolutionary announcement of himself to the world. He was lauded for his exemplary flow and storytelling ability. It has since gone on to be included in the conversation for the greatest rap album of all time. This was the record that made Nas.\nJay, born Shawn Carter, had a different comeup, having to quite literally fight his way to relevancy. His early life was marred by drug dealing and violence, but so was hip-hop in the 1990s. Hov even shot his own brother in the shoulder once for stealing his jewellery. He was street and rap was street, it was a match made in heaven.\nHe gained early notoriety through his battles with LL Cool J in the early ‘90s, but it was his third studio albumVol. 2… Hard Knock Life,released towards the end of the decade, that saw him step into the limelight.\nHov won a Grammy for his efforts and in an effort to sustain his hunger for success he releasedThe Blueprintin 2001. The whole rap community was put on notice, including Nas, and the beef between the two went from a simmer to boiling over.\nThe beef informally began in the mid-’90s as the pair threw subtle jabs at each other in throwaway lyrics. With Carter throwing the first punch, their fallout apparently steamed from a recording session for ‘Bring It On’, which Nas reportedly failed to show up to.\nFollowing the release ofThe Blueprint, the real war commenced as the track ‘Takeover’ took shots at Nas’ credits as an artist and his street cred. Not one to take a diss lightly, the senior rapper returned fire with his song ‘Ether’. The track completely destroyed the ’99 Problems’ rapper with accusations of misogyny and affairs being fired at all angles, accompanied by his own street cred attacks.\nThe battle came to a head with Jay’s release of ‘Supa Ugly’, where most significantly he bragged about having a three-year affair with Nasty Nas’ girlfriend. Many people considered this track a step too far, even Hov’s mother said on a radio appearance that he should apologise. This was the beef-killer but to this day it’s still uncertain who won.\nIn 2005 the pair made a shocking reconciliation as the two shared the stage and performed ‘Dead Presidents’ and ‘The World Is Yours’ in front of a sold-out crowd. Hov went on to say in the show “All that beef shit is done, we had our fun”.\nFour years after the end of the feud, Nas ended his deal with Columbia Records to sign with Deaf Jam, which was now headed by Jay himself. The two then went on to finally work together on the track ‘Black Republican’. The track is in a class of its own and is demonstrative of what happens when two titans come together instead of trying to take the other out.",

        "title": "How director Hype Williams changed hip-hop visuals forever",
        "description": "Hype Williamshas had an enormous impact on hip-hop culture that is genuinely unquantifiable. From fashion to visuals, the videographer has contributed so much to hip-hop that it is hard to imagine what the genre would be without his involvement. Although he is known as a videographer, producer, and screenwriter to hip-hop fans, his contributions reach far beyond that. Williams brought something to rap music that many new fans take for granted: flair and, more importantly, vibrancy.\nDespite the more edgy elements of hip-hop, when MCs recruited Hype Williams to craft a music video, he brought an unparalleled amount of dynamism which other directors couldn’t quite capture. Stylistically, he pushed some of the renowned rappers to embrace the weird and wonderful, and the results were often magical.\nFrom Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott to Jay-Z and Kanye West, some of the artists he worked with changed their own views on what a hip-hop music video could incorporate. Years later, we can now see the result of what Williams’ bold moves did to the aesthetics of rap music.\nWith the rise of MTV and YouTube, people wanted to escape more than ever, and Hype Williams realised this earlier than most. Throughout the late ’90s and 2000s, the videographer thrust hip-hop fans into futuristic, strange, technicolour worlds that somehow matched the energy of hip-hop. Even when Williams directed more conventional videos, they produced a grandeur that many others couldn’t achieve.\nOne of the first major artists who called upon Williams was the billionaire emcee Jay-Z.The two collaborated for ‘Can’t Knock The Hustle’and later Jay-Z’s ‘(Always Be My) Sunshine’ featuring Foxy Brown.\nIn an interview recalling the creation of his ‘Can’t Knock The Hustle’ music video, Jay-Z detailed, “It was the first time we worked together. ‘Can’t Knock The Hustle’ felt like cinema. We also have to talk about Malik [Hassan Sayeed], the cinematographer Hype worked with. The cinematography was just so beautiful, and the way it was shot just elevated it to another level.”\nThe ‘Marcy Me’ lyricist explained that whenever he worked with Hype Williams, he always had conviction about the creative decisions he was making. Recalling this, Hov reflected, “Hype definitely has a vision for what he wants to see. So he’d be like, “Yo, blow the smoke right here, and this is gonna be crazy. It’s going to be bananas!” But I don’t know if I was coachable as far as a performance at that time.”\nHe added, “I’m sure he coached Missy more or coached Busta more, and you could get more out of them. I don’t know if he could get more out of us at that time. And then it was like 30 of us, and all we wanted to do is laugh.”\nOne rapper that Hype Williams worked extensively with during the late ’90s was the one and only Missy Elliott.The female emcee’s videos are widely considered iconic,but speaking toComplex,the Virginia native credited Williams with some of her most memorable looks and videos.\nSpeaking about the lead single of her 1997 album,Supa Dupa Fly,Elliott revealed Williams took charge, remembering, “When we first met, Hype said he loved my music, and he felt that the video should reflect my sound, and for him, my music sounded futuristic. He was hype, so it makes sense that his name is Hype Williams. When he pitched the idea of the blow-up suit and the fisheye lens for ‘The Rain’, I wasn’t hesitant because I’ve always been a risk-taker. Nothing was off-limits to me visually.”\nMissy admitted it was a match made in heaven as they “understood each other’s visions.” However, akin to many, she couldn’t overstate the impact the director has had on the culture, expressing, “Hype videos define so much in the culture of not just hip-hop music videos but all videos, period. He was very particular about the colour and texture of videos and making sure he was the first to do something.”\nShe continued, “He made sure he connected with the artist and that those videos showcased what type of artist you were. Hype fought for big budgets because he knew that these videos wouldn’t just be videos. They were going to be a work of art that will be studied when we are all long gone.”\nAlthough Hype Williams was most prevalent in the late 1990s and 2000s, he made some exciting videos in the 2010s, such as Kanye West’s ‘All Of The Lights’. He has been such a staple over the years that his work has impacted younger generations, including the Harlem native A$AP Rocky, who professed his love for the director and videographer.\nSpeaking about how Williams opened his eyes, Rocky toldComplex, “I grew up on Hype Williams and loved his work ever since I was a kid. His visuals are very enticing, so when my development for film started to broaden I realised that he meticulously worked in similar ways to myself. He always assembles the best teams from the gaffers, first ADs, colourists, art department, cinematographers, etc., to get his vision across.”\nTheLong.Love.A$APcreator even unveiled his favourite Williams creation, stating, “My favourite Hype video is ‘Woo-Hah!!’ by Busta Rhymes. I think the reason I loved it is because I was a kid, so the vibrant colours and the fisheye lens really stood out to me. I think Busta’s charisma and Hype WIlliams’ direction was a perfect groundbreaking connection. I think Hype Williams is the godfather of hip-hop visuals. He takes iconic urban cinematography to another level.”",

        "title": "The influence of hip-hop on presidential elections",
        "description": "Inhip-hopand outside of it, it seems like it is impossible to get away from the circus that has engulfed American politics. In what appears to be the most divisive election in recent memory, the battle between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will reach its crescendo on November 5th.\nIn the digital age we are privy to all, if not most, of the factors that influence presidential elections. If you were unaware, it is quite alarming. Elon Musk has basically turned Twitter nto a right wing propaganda machine, whilst other tech giants, such as Meta and Google, have been cited in moderating conservative content, favouring the left. Where both parties can claim some semblance of agreement is that they will take the money of the highest bidder if they adjust their policies ever so slightly. It seems that in order to be influential, you either need a large audience or a large sack of cash. Enter hip-hop.\nIn a paper titled Music and Politics, published at Oxford University in 2013, J.Street stated that, “Various movements, minorities, and political groups across the globe used rap to bring attention to inequality. As a result, rap and hip hop were ‘almost exclusively viewed as political’ in many places, especially in its original context of the Afro-American and Latin communities of the 1970s and 80s.”\nAccording to the University of Westminster, “Music is popular – and this means politicians want to control it. This is why in Russia, for example, music has been censored through the 20th century. Rock, jazz and blues were forbidden almost until the 1990s. The state paid money to the loyal musicians who, they hoped, would distract local citizens from the Western bands like Rolling Stones and Guns ’N’ Roses. These state-sponsored rock bands were relatively popular, but not as fiery as Western rock. Punk, rap and hip-hop are the edgiest music genres in modern Russia. However, there is a state-sponsored version of rap music and there are rap artists critical of this.”\nIn essence, if you want to minimise the number of people who oppose you, limit access to messages from those on the mic. Hip-hop has, in one way or another, always been political. Artists such as Public Enemy, with tracks such as ‘Fight the power’ and KRS-One with ‘Sound of da police’ have advocated for social equality for the oppressed. Chuck D, Public Enemy’s lead vocalist and creative lead, once said that, “Rap music was the invisible TV station that Black America never had.”\nDuring the 2020 election, artists such as Cardi B and Killer Mike have been politically active, with the former interviewing Bernie Sanders about his policies and discussing politics with her followers on Instagram live, and the latter campaigning for Democratic candidates in Georgia.For obvious reasons, hip-hop artists have historically been left-leaning (Kanye West’s and M.I.As endorsement for Donald Trump notwithstanding).\nIf it was already abundantly clear, the stakes are quite high for this election. The issues that existed when hip hop was born still stand today. Racial injustice, economic inequality and climate change, amongst others. Hip-hop holds the unique position of being particularly popular amongst younger voters. With the rise of social media platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram, amplifying the political messages that artists are raising, hip hop acts as a catalyst for social change, as traditional political campaigns are less likely to influence this key demographic.\nChance the rapper has been vocal in recent months about the importance of voting in elections. Not just the federal election but also vote for senators, governors and other officials who have a vote in policies that affect the people. Whilst YG and Nipsey Hussle’s 2016 track ‘F*** Donald Trump’ has picked up in popularity again.\nToday, artists are more than just entertainers. They can influence their fans in ways that politicians could only dream of. The overarching message (aside from the pointed jab at the Republican party leader above) has been to make your voice heard, most importantly at the polls.\nThe fact that people of colour have been disenfranchised for decades, in conjunction with the propensity for gerrymandering (which is the practice of manipulating the boundaries of a constituency to favour a political party), opportunities for social change have been severely inhibited. Hip-hop, acting a a voice for the oppressed, has, and will continue to have, the platform to affect change for the greater good.",

        "title": "Can J Cole recover from the embarrassment of Kendrick and Drake beef?",
        "description": "FollowingJ. Colewithdrawing from what has been touted as the great rap war of 2024, the response from his contemporaries has been mixed. Benny the Butcher praised Cole for his decision to take the high road saying in a recent interview withFight Hype, “That’s my dawg. You can see how gossip-y and everything that this battle has turned into. Can you blame him for not wanting to be a part of this at this moment. Could you blame him? I don’t.”\nWhen asked if Cole did the right thing, Benny responded with, “I probably would have went about it in a different way, but it’s like a gossip battle, you know what I mean. It’s not like a rap battle, it’s like a business, telling each other business type thing. I wouldn’t want to be a part of that.”\nNPR, in agreement with The Butcher summed up the entire situation as merely an exercise to garner attention. “If that feels like an anticlimactic outcome for hip-hop’s reigning titans squaring off, blame it on the context-flattening effect of our current social reality. Rap purists and pop number-crunchers are all wading around in the same murky discourse soup, and a lot of the metrics that used to feel like a given are looser now, superimposing a shape on something gray and amorphous.”\n“It figures, then, that the truest means of ascent is to try and to get to the top of the trending list, and to stay as long as possible; the only thing of equal value to everyone is collective attention. The diehards will never admit it, but beef has become far more about the drama than the bars or even the hostility, which explains both the overenthusiasm for a pretty down-the-middle shot from Kendrick, and the sourpuss complaints about Cole’s retraction.”\nOn the other side of the fence, however, others have chimed in condemning the Fayetteville rapper for his actions.\nThe Game took to X (formerly twitter) to show his distaste for how hip hop beef is handled in the modern era. “Hip hop/Rap or whatever yall calling it these days was already watered down, then Cole apologised and turned this sh*t into Kool-Aid [with] no sugar.”\nFat Joe, in an interview with Jay Shetty, said that, “[Cole] probably saw that it could get real messy and real ugly and so he said, ‘Yo, you know what, this ain’t me I don’t want no parts of it.’ But he definitely got a stripe off his…they took a stripe off of that, because in hip-hop, they call you out, you come out.”\nSo what now for Cole? Having polarised the hip hop community with his action, or lack of action, can he continue on as if nothing had happened? Or will he forever be marked as the someone that couldn’t take the heat? In his new track, which was released on Wednesday, ‘Port Antonio’, Cole addresses the situation and its aftermath.\nLines such as, “I pulled the plug because I seen where that was about to go, they wanted blood, they wanted clicks to make they pockets grow / Wouldn’t have lost the battle, dog, I would’ve lost a bro, I would’ve gained a foe, and all for what?”, highlight the bigger picture thinking that Cole was undergoing at the time of the beefs instigation.\nHaving already cleared the air with Kendrick following his public apology for releasing ‘7-minute drill’ and saying that he felt “lame” and “terrible” for dissing him whilst on stage at Dreamville festival, Cole addresses Drake in the track as well. “Aye Drake, you’ll always be my n***a, I ain’t ashamed to say you did a lot for me, my n***a / Fuck all the narratives, tapping back into your magic pen is what’s imperative.” It appears peace is the only solution that the ‘Work out’ rapper will settle for.\nSome bridges have definitely been burned. Hip-hop has always been synonymous with adversity. From those within and those without. That being said, Cole would likely feel vindicated following the desecration of Drake’s legacy that we were all witness to. I’m fairly sure that Drake has to ask for Kendrick’s permission if he wants to put put new music now. I know that sounds outlandish, but I don’t make the rules.\nPerhaps we will now see a new version of J Cole, one in which he focuses on himself rather than dragging down those around him. In all honesty though, would that be so different from the version that we already have?",

        "title": "Why JID could be the next icon of hip-hop",
        "description": "JIDhas been making music for a while now, but he’s been steadily climbing up the Hip Hop ladder in terms of popularity and the quality of his output.\nThe rapper — real name Destin Choice Route — was born in Atlanta in 1990 and acquired his stage name from his grandmother, who nicknamed him JID due to his “jittery” behaviour. Inspired by everyone from Sly and the Family Stone and Earth, Wind & Fire to JAY-Z, Nas and Mobb Deep, he released his debut mixtapeCakewalkin 2010.\nJID came up in the industry alongside school friends EARTHGANG and funded his music career by delivering pizza and working in call centres. He released a number of solo mixtapes before hitting the road with Ab-Soul on his These Days Tour in 2014 and dropping music with his Spillage Village collective.\nLife changed for JID in 2019 when it was announced he had signed a deal withJ Cole’s Dreamville label. Even from the outset, Cole believed he had what it takes to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. “The first thing is how gifted he was with putting his words together,” Cole said about him. “The thing that solidified it was when I saw his worth ethic and his hunger. A lot of people want it, but they not willing to put in the work. He’s not one of those people. His potential is G.O.A.T. status.”\nSince signing to Dreamville, JID has released three studio albums, includingThe Never Storyin 2017,DiCaprio 2in 2018 andThe Forever Storyin 2022. Each release has seen him climb higher up the Billboard 200 chart, with his last effort reaching as high as number 12. It included an elite list of collaborators such as Yasiin Bey and Lil Wayne, as well as a TikTok hit in ‘Surround Sound’ featuring 21 Savage and Baby Tate that sparked the “Ceiling Challenge.”\nHe’s also appeared across a couple of Dreamville compilations,Revenge of the Dreamers IIIandD-Day: A Gangsta Grillz Mixtape, proving his skills alongside the likes of J. Cole, Bas, Cozz, Lute and the rest of the imprint.\nOutside of his own music, JID has featured on various major tours, including J. Cole’s 4 Your Eyez Only Tour, Logic’s Confessions of a Dangerous Mind Tour and 21 Savage’s American Dream Tour. He was also set to join Mac Miller on The Swimming Tour prior to the Pittsburgh rapper’s sudden death in 2018.\nJID has received three Grammy nominations to date, getting recognition in the Best Rap Performance category for ‘Down Bad’ and Best Rap Album forRevenge of the Dreamers III. In addition, he was part of Doja Cat’sPlanet Heralbum having teamed up on ‘Options’, making him eligible for an Album of the Year nomination.\nIn 2021, he earned the biggest song of his career yet, collaborating with Imagine Dragons on the hit ‘Enemy’. Peaking at number five on the Hot 100, the record served as the lead single for Netflix’sArcanesoundtrack and also appeared on Dragons’Mercury – Acts 1 & 2album.\nJID  secured arguably the most notable guest spot of his career in July by featuring on Eminem’s ‘Fuel’, which appeared on hisThe Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)album. JID is well aware of the expectations people have for him, and he can feel his career gradually moving upwards. “Everything’s just been going up,” he toldPeople. “Like I said, just stepping stones. So I just want to make sure everything I do is bigger than the last time I’ve done it, and everything follows suit with that little method or whatever. Just more opportunities and just more visibility and more eyes on the music.”\nHe continued, “And that’s just really what I wanted to see me in that regard, as opposed to just being social media viral. I’d rather you open up. “I actually want to see him in this festival concert,” or “I want to play this song every day because it gives me a different outlook.”\nJID also performed at Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk’s blockbuster fight in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, putting together a medley inside the 30,000 capacity Kingdom Arena. Thanks to social media, the Atlanta rapper can’t escape the artists people often compare him to, for reasons both good and bad. He’s noticed that more than ever following the release ofThe Forever Story. “I see people comparing me to people I should never be compared to,” he said. “And not in a positive way, like comparing me to DMX or André 3000. That’s why Twitter is the wild, wild west because you could just say anything and it could be a topic of conversation.\n“But yeah, I see a lot of conversations around the project and people saying that it put me in a different position with it. I still got goals to go forward. This project, it’s helping open up the door for the rest of the stuff I’m going to be doing.”\nThe only way is up for JID. His upcoming solo album,Forever & a Day, and collaborative album with Metro Boomin,JIDTRO, should solidify that.",

        "title": "“I had a horrible attitude”: How Nicki Minaj was discovered",
        "description": "Nicki Minajhas always been able to find a way to make a headline. In her early career, it was for her music as she was setting the standard for female rappers. More recently, it’s typical to see her name plastered in the news for whatever insane antic or rant that she’s been involved in that given week.\nMinaj, whose real name; Onika Marat-Petty, finishes on a pretty apt note, was born in Trinidad and Tobago but moved to Queens New York when she was five. She alleges that she went over to the country as an illegal immigrant and still isn’t a US citizen whilst on a TikTok live stream, saying “you would think that with the millions of dollars that I’ve paid in taxes to this country that I would have been given an honorary citizenship”.\nThe rapper didn’t have the easiest upbringing though. She admitted in a 2014MTVdocumentary that her father was an alcoholic and addicted to crack cocaine. This led to his being quite abusive to her mother and eventually, he even burned down the family home.\nDespite her tough beginnings, the Queens native saw massive success during her rocket-fueled ride to the top in the early 2010s. Her debut studio album,Pink Friday, peaked at number one on theBillboard200 and sold an impressive 375,000 copies in its first week.\nNicki used this success to catapult herself into the mainstream and cemented herself there with the release of her third studio album,The Pinkprint, in 2014, which saw massive critical acclaim. This was it, there was no getting rid of Nicki Minaj now, for better or for worse.\nIn the years following the release ofThe Pinkprint, the New York native has arguably been better known for her controversies than her music.\nThe biggest controversy that Minaj was embroiled in revolved around her marriage. The ‘Starships’ singer wed Kenneth Petty in 2015 and was quickly lambasted for this decision. This is because the singer’s now husband has a previous conviction for rape.\nIn 2021 a fresh lawsuit was filed against Petty alleging him of sexual assault. The couple attempted to broker a deal with the alleged victim who in exchange for issuing a statement denying the sexual assault happened, would receive $20,000 and a video from the rapper wishing her daughter a happy birthday.\nDuring the height of the Covid pandemic, she tweeted, “They want you to get vaccinated for the Met. If I get vaccinated it won’t be for the Met. It’ll be once I feel I’ve done enough research”. This was met with a lot of backlash considering that by the time the 2021 Met Gala had rolled around, the vaccine already had a proven track record of working.\nEven recently,Minaj had to apologise and explain why she had attacked her long-time friendand photographer Alex ‘Griz’ Lucas. The rapper might be purposely holding onto controversy though, as it played a part in her discovery. After abandoning her dream to act, Nicki struggled to keep a job, tellingBillboardin 2010 “I’d been fired like 15 times because I had a horrible attitude”.\nShe even went into detail about her sacking from Red Lobster; “I chased a customer out of the restaurant once so I could stick my middle finger up at her and demand that she give me my pen back.”\nEither way, her non-commitment to keeping a job saw a young Onika create mixtapes and post them to her MySpace page. Fendi; the CEO of the Dirty Money Entertainment label fell upon her MySpace account one day and signed her almost immediately. He then co-signed her on hisCome UpDVD series. Lil Wayne saw Minaj’sCome Upperformance and was enamoured and in 2009 signed her to Young Money.\nFrom there on it’s been success after success for Nicki, so the moral of the story is to always be yourself, I guess.",

        "title": "The story of Soulja Boy’s fame and fall-off",
        "description": "The South is currently the hub of hip-hop, and Atlanta has become the Mecca of the culture. Having produced acts such as The Migos, Playboi Carti, 21 Savage, Young Thug, and Future, Atlanta is one of the most prolific cities regarding rap. However, some of its exports have been divisive. One such person isSoulja Boy.\nSoulja Boy emerged during the MySpace era between 2005 and 2009 when the social network prevailed as the go-to platform for hopeful aspiring rappers. From Young B and M.I.A. to Soulja Boy and even Azealia Banks, MySpace birthed many MCs.\nHowever, a series of child-friendly, danceable rap songs became prominent in the mainstream during this era. Whether it’s the 2006 track ‘Chicken Noodle Soup’ or Soulja Boy’s ‘Crank Dat,’ the then-17-year-old became a star overnight. Songs such as ‘Crank That,’ ‘Donk,’ and ‘Turn My Swag On’ revived hip-hop with dance-orientated lyrics and simple beats that made his rap style particularly appealing to young children. However, since his MySpace days,the Atlanta artisthas become known as a brash, arrogant and flashy character whose material does not match his ego. As such, following his initial run, Soulja Boy failed to keep up in many ways.\nFollowing the MySpace takeover, as record labels and streaming platforms began to manipulate internet algorithms to their own advantage, the possibility of Soulja Boy succeeding with low-quality, frivolous dance-along tracks was slim, and his ability to make music with longevity was poor.\nAlthough Soulja Boy’s rise to fame was quick and exciting, many would say it happened too fast, and as a result of his instantaneous fame, he became awfully arrogant. However, he quickly found out that dance tracks like ‘Donk’ can only get you so far in the music business.\nUnfortunately, the lyricist managed tosustain his relevance through internet shenanigans.Soulja Boy’s pastime has been goading successful artists on the internet and undermining the musical ability of his peers. However, it has been a successful tactic for the 34-year-old musician.\nIn 2007, the rapper released his debut project,Souljaboytellem.com. To this day, it is his only project to receive a certification in any country, going platinum in New Zealand. Furthermore, it is his only album to debut in the top ten of the Billboard 200, reaching number four. But Soulja Boy’s fall off was fast and embarrassingly painful. His sophomore album,iSouljaBoyTellem, peaked at number 43, and, in an unparalleled turn of events, his third studio project,The DeAndre Way,only managed to reach number 90.\nIt is fair to say that Soulja Boy was a classic spike-and-crash hip-hop flop, and unsurprisingly, the internet played a huge part. The same can be said for other MCs who came up this way, such as Tekashi 6ix9ine, Lil Pump, and Ice Spice. Social media can be fickle and, most of the time, does not produce real artists with creative vision.\nFurthermore, much of the content on social media, whether that be MySpace, TikTok, or Instagram, gains traction because of its visuals rather than its artistic quality. Although Soulja Boy undoubtedly fell off, he has released eight albums since his debut. None of which charted. He has also released a vast amount of mixtapes. Still, none of the Atlanta native’s material has cut through since 2010.",

        "description": "Busta Rhymeshas had an illustrious career, and during his prime in the 1990s and early 2000s, he released some epic hits. From ‘Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See’ to ‘Pass The Courvoisier Pt. II’, the Flipmode frontman, is no stranger to the charts.\nIn 1998, Busta Rhymes released his third studio album,Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front. The biggest hit from the project was, in fact, the fourth and final single of the album, ‘What’s It Gonna Be?!’ featuring Janet Jackson.\nThe track was one that Busta recorded last-minute, but one of the songs that was intended to dominate the charts was the second single, ‘Gimme Some More’. The instrumental, which the theme of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 cult classicPsycho, was a stark contrast to Busta’s usual beats, which were hard-hitting and aggressive.\nProduced by DJ Scratch, the song has since become a fan favourite despite its failure to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. During an appearance on the YouTube series BET Talks, Scratch spoke about the creation of ‘Gimme Some More’, how he made it and Busta’s reaction to it.\n‘Gimme Some More’ has an odd skip to its drum pattern, and it’s something that is loved by fans but wasn’t initially popular withthe Brooklyn emcee. Speaking about how it grew on Busta. Scratch told BET, “With that particular beat, he didn’t understand the bounce at the time, so he passed on it.”\nThe DJ continued, “But when we got to his third album, he was like, ‘Yo you still got that beat?’ and I was like ‘What beat?’ and he was like ‘The one that sound like Timbaland!’ He literally wrote and recorded the first two verses of ‘Gimme Some More’ in 15 minutes”\nIt’s hard to imagine Busta Rhymes penning such complex and rapid-fire lyrics in such a short space of time. However, the DJ was insistent that the Flipmode frontman was that efficient. ‘Gimme Some More’ was popular overseas and was a top ten single in the UK, landing at number five.\nIn fact, despite its unpopularity in the US, it was still nominated for a Grammy Award in 2000 but understandably lost out to the star of the year Eminem, who clinched the award with his single ‘My Name Is’ fromThe Marshall Mathers LP.\nThe single’s music video was delivered in typical Busta Rhymes style with outlandish outfits, kookie scenes, and unusual videography techniques.Directed by the legendary Hype Williams,the entire video was filmed using a fish-eye lens, creating a somewhat unusual viewing experience. Although the video is entertaining it is undoubtedly Busta’s flawless lyrical flow that makes the track so amazing.",

The LA rapper’s 2024 smash ‘Not Like Us’ recently won ‘Record of The Year’ at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, and to the disappointment of Drake fans and critics alike, seemed happy to see Lamar receive the honour.\nThe legendary diss track didn’t just receive one award, though. Over the course of the night, Kendrick Lamar and DJ Mustard earned themselves three in the categories of ‘Best Rap Performance’, ‘Best Rap Song’ and finally ‘Best Music Video.’\nTo clinch their accolades, the two West Coast icons beat Cardi B, A$AP Rocky, Doechii, GloRilla, and even Eminem. DJ Mustard picked up the awards for some of the acceptance speeches on behalf of Kendrick. During one of his addresses, Mustard K Dot, God, and pgLang, Mustard then declared that he and Kendrick were just getting started, and said, “Three. Let’s get it.”\nWith three wins out of the five categories he was nominated in, Kendrick Lamar has now entered the big league and is approaching the same number of Grammy wins as Jay-Z and Kanye, who have won 21 and 24 awards, respectively.\nOther artists who won awards at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards include Rapsody and Erykah Badu, who clinched the title in the ‘Best Melodic Rap Performance’ category for their collaboration, ‘3:AM.’ This is the first-ever Grammy win for Rapsody and the fifth Grammy for Badu.\nThe category hip-hop of ‘Best Rap Album’ is scheduled to be presented during the official 2025 Grammy’s show at Cryptyo.com Arena. Projects up for the award include J Cole’sMight Delete Later, Eminem’sThe Death Of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce),Doechii’sAlligator Bites Never Healand the iconicWe Don’t Trust Youfrom Future & Metro Boomin.\nKendrick Lamar’s multiple Grammy wins reflect a more significant shift in the wider hip-hop community. For years, Drake has been at the forefront of hip-hop. However, much of his material over the years has fallen outside hip-hop. Whether it’s his experimentation with house music or afrobeat, Drizzy’s music has sounded less and less like rap music over the years.\nIn fact, it has become an unrecognisable mix of pop and dance music that has somehow managed to impose itself into the hip-hop category. The Toronto emcee has received various accolades, cementing him as the best rapper for music that has very little to do with the genre and until recently, the culture didn’t seem to care.\nWhile this was happening, Kendrick Lamar was releasing high-quality hip-hop albums with meaningful messages and instrumentals that were true to the genre. That said, his battle with Drake last year made many people question the Canadian’s place in hip-hop. Furthermore, a lot of commentators and podcasters have insisted that Drake’s dominance has been chiefly due to record labels.\nDuring an episode of hisPeople’s Partypodcast, Talib Kweli admitted that Kendrick Lamar’s deconstruction of Drake’s relationship with Black America on‘Not Like Us’ made him awarethat he was never comfortable with Drizzy using the word “n*gger” in his music considering his biracial, middle-class background.\nAlthough other MCs in hip-hop experiment with different genres, people have noted an inauthenticity concerning Drake and his willingness to drop rap when other sounds become more popular. The ‘War’ emcee was quick to begin making drill in 2014 and swiftly pivoted to afrobeat when Burna Boy gained traction in the US.\nKendrick Lamar has done no such thing, and as Kanye West stated last year, many are “energised” to see the downfall of Drake, who has ridden many cultural waves over the years to his own benefit.\nAfteryears of TikTok sensations,fads and subpar musicians, it appears that Kendrick Lamar has single-handedly revived hip-hop and opened people’s eyes to the tacit exploitation of the culture by foreign MCs dominating a homegrown African-American movement.",

        "title": "J Dilla: The producer who humanised the MPC",
        "description": "J Dillawas one of the most esteemed hip-hop producers of his time. Many were and still are in awe of his talent, and although he is no longer with us, his music continues to inspire and, at the same time, confuse people. J Dilla broke all the rules of rap music production and, akin to Kanye West, had people staggered by how seamlessly he could produce soulful, hard-hitting music.\nBorn and raised in Detroit, Dilla first found fame when he began producing for MCs from the Midwest in the late 1990s. He very quickly became a popular beatmaker and was an integral driving force behindthe Soulquarian movement of the 1990s. Dilla was admired by acts such as Q-Tip, Questlove, Erykah Badu, and Common and was Pete Rock’s successor.\nJ Dilla was renowned for his ability to humanise his drum machine and make it sound like a live band. He had many stylistic quirks that made him a fascinating musician. Dilla wasn’t an artist who used lavish studios; instead, he made all of his music in a Detroit basement full of old vinyl and sampling material. This environment contributed to his raw and exposed beats.\nThe Detroit nativefaced a unique problem when he first began producing hip-hop. As a lover of soul music and Motown from his home city, he was used to bands. However, in hip-hop, the most popular drum machine, the AKAI MPC, had a tool called a ‘quantise’ button. The tool ensured every instrumental element was on time and fell on an appropriate beat. Fortunately, theDonutscreator knew something that other producers didn’t — that the imperfection of a human hand was sometimes what made music so interesting.\nWhether it was a funk drummer who chose to add some offbeat flair or a jazz percussionist who caught an oddly satisfying pocket, music was far more exciting when it captured the passion of those who made it. As such, J Dilla actively refrained from allowing his AKAI MPC60 to auto-correct and perfectly align every beat.\nJ Dilla found how to make his music more intriguing by avoiding specific tools that would have made his beats more robotic and stiff. The result of his choice is a discography full of incredibly off-kilter drums. Even with his basses, instead of having everything align, he would sometimes use the MPC60 and have the riffs, sometimes sitting incredibly behind the actual pace of the song. However, the lag was somewhat satisfying.\nThe Slum Village collaborator had an ear-driven musical sensibility that not many producers have, which led to him not caring whether or not his records sped up and then suddenly slowed down as long as it felt good. Dilla played his MPC60 in the way that Jimmi Hendrix played his guitar and John Coltrane played his saxophone. It was an extension of him.\nAlthough many people run their samples through computers as opposed to physical hardware in the modern age, those who use more modern MPCs have, unfortunately, fallen prey to the desire for a drum beat to be forcefully quantised and lifeless.\nWhether it’s Young Chop, who pioneered the current drill sound or Lil Jon, who highly influenced the simplicity and rigidity of hip-hop’s trap beats, some producers could learn a lot from how J Dilla humanised the MPC and hip-hop production in a digital era.",

        "title": "Five things we learned from the rise of the South",
        "description": "Until the mid-1990s, the South was a relatively neglected region in terms ofhip-hop. Of course, people from the Southern states were listening to music from the region. However, it took a while for the South to find its own sound and get on its feet. Still, it managed to do so. Although the South is a part of the US, it is distinctly different in many ways, which makes its music that much more interesting. A city like New York is a melting pot of different cultures. As such, whether it’s Dominicans in the Bronx, Haitians in Brooklyn or Jamaicans in Harlem, the immigrant communities contributed greatly to the creation and philosophy of hip-hop.\nStill, early rap lyrics heavily reflected New York City. Not only did rappers visually have a New York style, but their songs madereferences to ‘Uptown,’the ‘Boogie Down Bronx,’ and ‘The A-train.’ Although these subjects are interesting to many, they were and are completely unrelatable to Black Americans from the South. In the 1980s, the West Coast forged its own lane with gangsta rap acts such as NWA and Ice T, but unlike California, states like Georgia and Louisiana failed to get recognition on a nationwide scale.\nHowever, in the 1990s, hip-hopfinally gained a new respect for the Southafter its long struggle. Now more than ever, rappers from what is colloquially known as ‘The Dixies’ are being uplifted and empowered. However, during hip-hop’s formative years, the region’s music was a non-factor, especially in the eyes of New Yorkers.\nBut strangely, in 2025,the sonic of Atlanta-born trap musicnot only runs hip-hop but has become the de facto way of producing hits. The sound is prominent in New York MCs like Cardi B and Lil TJay, as well as in West Coast torchbearers like Kendrick Lamar and Roddy Ricch. As such, we have explained how the formerly irrelevant South became a cultural epicentre of hip-hop in three decades.\nThe South has always maintained a sense of regional pride, which proved crucial to the area’s musical success in the long term. When the genre of hip-hop first arose, New York DJs unsurprisingly played artists from the city on the radio. The same happened when the West Coast began to experience a boom in the 1980s. However, as the culture became a nationwide phenomenon, inter-city radio play became frequent.\nFurthermore, radio stations in certain areas began to draft more prestigious DJs from outside. This led to an increase in the number of tastemakers with no knowledge of the local music scene seizing power. However, the South never had this issue, and, as once highlighted by Snoop Dogg, whether you’re in the club or listening to the airwaves, hip-hop from outside the region has always taken a backseat. As such, new talent is frequently promoted, and the area is in a constant state of musical renewal.\nSince the 1980s, New York artists have gone against one another and created vicious feuds. Over time, this actually led to a decline in the quality of music coming out of the city as it became very segregated. From the Juice Crew vs BDP to G-Unit vs Murder Inc, with less collaboration a hostile environment was created, which in turn stopped New York from flourishing.\nOn the other hand, most of the South’s rappers co-exist and create amazing music with each other. Lil Baby is happy to collaborate with Young Thug, and the latter is happy to collaborate with Playboi Carti. These relationships lead to amazing projects, smash hits and a sense of dynamism that doesn’t exist in other parts of the US. While 50 Cent was getting shot,  Three 6 Mafia, UGK and Project Pat were collaborating on ‘Sippin’ on Some Sizzurp’ — a Southern anthem. Such an environment removes unneeded sideshows and often leads to more money.\nAlthough hip-hop is innately political and is a great way to spread messages, many artists from outside the South politicised their music so much that they ultimately alienated their listeners. It’s important to have messages in your music, but it is also important to create songs that uplift people. That said, with such a prevalent strip club culture, the South never forgot about the importance of club anthems.\nIn the 1990s, many artists from both New York and LA began to become preachy, condescending and overly focused on “kicking knowledge.” These kinds of tracks can’t be played in the club and are in no way uplifting. While albums such asThe Miseducation Of Lauryn Hillare key to hip-hop, MCs producing a barrage of politically charged tracks will find it hard to see the top of the charts, and, in the South, the club is king.\nThe South has always been a great producer of mixtapes and no one epitomises this quite like Lil Wayne. The Louisiana native has 29 mixtapes, and this represents something. Although mixtapes on the East Coast were a big deal in the 2000s, the mixtapes (even in the ‘90s) were primarily compilations of the hottest tracks out. What Lil Wayne cleverly figured out is that people in the South would love to hear a version of these anthems that were more relatable and even grow to prefer them.\nMCs from all over the South did this, and, unsurprisingly, local radio DJs played for their audience. As a result, many tracks, such as Dipset’s ‘Get From Round Me’ had an alternate version. ‘Get Em’ which appeared on Lil Wayne’sDedication 2,was far more popular than the New York original. This happened across the South and unlike in other regions, tailored mixtapes with familiar references were listened to by natives a lot more than the commercially palatable albums.\nUnlike other regions of the US, the South has always embraced evolution in its music and has never seemed so desperate to hang on to the sonic it had during its heyday. When crunk emerged in the 2000s, other local artists immediately embraced it and helped the sound grow. When trap first came to the forefront, elders from the South welcomed it.\nOn the East Coast, figures such as Pete Rock have decided to call drill “trash.” Styles P has said, “it ain’t nothing,” and Tony Yayo has asserted it’s bad for the city. From these examples alone, it is clear to see why New York hip-hop hasn’t moved forward or adopted a new sound as, it seems, the city’s elders won’t allow the sound to change. That said, until the above points are noticed as the blueprint for domination, the West and East Coasts will fail to have a new renaissance.",

        "title": "Why Cardi B’s ‘WAP’ is most definitely not a feminist masterpiece",
        "description": "WhenCardi B’sfamous single ‘WAP’ was released in 2020, it raised eyebrows, and even more people began to take issue with it when Cardi B performed it alongside Megan Thee Stallion at the  63rd annual Grammy Awards.\n‘WAP’ wasn’t just a phenomenon, but it was a song that polarised hip-hop. Many music publications labelled it as a feminist masterpiece that showed how sexually liberated women are in the 21st century. However, the track led to a lot of questions about the influence and responsibility that comes with being a celebrity.\nSexual content and sexually provocative lyrics are not something new in hip-hop.From Lil Kim to Trina and Nicki Minajit is something that is, in fact, quite common. However, the outrage and division that ‘WAP’ provoked was slightly different to anything the culture had seen in previous years.\nIn the past, female MCs have used metaphors to discuss sex and similar topics. Still, Cardi B’s brazen and unapologetic track made many question whether a line had been crossed. Furthermore, her performance alongside Megan Thee Stallion at the Grammys was not something that many Americans felt should be aired on primetime television.\nStill, despite the brazen vulgarity of ‘WAP’, critics were hailing it as a modern feminist masterpiece. However, This sentiment was one I struggled to come to terms with. ‘WAP’, which is an acronym for Wet A** P*ssy, is undoubtedly the furthest thing imaginable from a feminist masterpiece. If ‘WAP’ was made as an ode to sex propogating that the pièce de résistance of a woman is her body, then it undoubtedly counteracts all the efforts of modern feminism. In an era where more and more women are rightly being praised for their intellect and creative brainpower, the promotion of ‘WAP’ as a masterpiece puts sex at the forefront once again.\nReducing a woman’s being to only her sexual promiscuity could prove to be highly damaging to women in the long run.  One critical aspect that fans and critics conveniently forgot shortly after WAP’s release is that Cardi B is a mother and a wife (for now). As such, while she makes music glorifying the stereotypical slut, on a day-to-day basis, she is actually extremely far removed from that lifestyle. Hip-hop has seen this duplicity before in drug rap, and shortly after the SoundCloud era, the US found itself in an opioid crisis which saw several rappers die.\nAlthough official statistics are hard to come by, many would infer from the deaths of figures such as Rich Homie Quan, Mac Miller and Juice Wrld that drug abuse in rap is on the rise. That said, ‘WAP’ and its relentless promotion created our hip-hop culture today with Sexyy Red and Ice Spice. Indirectly breeding a generation of young women to feel they have to live up to what WAP tells them to be is toxic.\nThe labelling of ‘WAP’ as a masterpiece is nonsensical. If men in hip-hop demand the stereotypical slut, then surely women like Cardi B further pushing this stereotype in any shape or form are making women more subservient to men by playing up to that male ideal of a woman. Instead, should women not be creating new, more realistic ideals that show the multi-faceted nature of women instead of the one-dimensional slut?\nFor a long time now, rap music has centred around money and sex, but ‘WAP’ may have prolonged the degradation of women in hip-hop for a generation, as it so brazenly and shamelessly helped reaffirm all the preconceived notions men in hip-hop already have about black women and their promiscuity. And yes, ‘WAP’s release was a disservice to black women as there was not a single white woman in the video.",

        "title": "How Drake went from a ‘6 God’ to a ‘6 Man’ in one year",
        "description": "Drizzy, Champagne Papi, The Boy.Drakeis a man of many nicknames, all co-signed by himself. The ‘Nothing Was the Same’ rapper also calls himself the ‘6 God’ to reference his origins. ‘The 6’ is a nickname for Toronto due to its six boroughs and area codes 416 and 647, while the nickname essentially calls him the king of where he comes from.\nIn 2014, Drake took things even further and put his claim into music, releasing a song called ‘6 God’. He raps on the song, “I hear the talk on road is I’m the shit, boy/ Phone call back home, shit is hot up in TThe 6, boy/ Shit hot up in The 6 right now/ Shit hot up in The 6, boy/ Shit is hot up in The 6 right now/ Come see us and get it fixed, boy.”\nDrake released the hard-hitting track, produced by Boi-1da and Syk Sense, the day after his birthday alongside two other songs, ‘How About Now’ and ‘Heat of the Moment’. At the time, he revealed that he dropped the songs because hackers stole them.\n‘6 God’ appeared on his mixtape, 2015’sIf You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, alongside another Toronto-centred track called ‘6 Man’. In the song, Drake references NBA player Louis Williams, who was previously the sixth man for the Toronto Raptors.\nHe raps, “Boomin out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will’/ 6 Man like Lou Will’/ Two girls and they get along like I’m— (Lou)/ Like I’m Lou Will’, I just got the new deal.” Williams was only at the Raptors for one season, but he won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year.\nDaxs, who produced the song with Noah ’40’ Shebib, explained how the beat came about. “It was quick,” he toldComplex. “I basically did all the drums, but the idea for the beat came from him putting two of my beats together as one to get the bounce, and he did the melodies on it and everything.”\nDrake’s nicknames have inspired social media handles and tattoos. In 2016, a fan toldVice, “I’m a huge Drake fan. I just spent $2,500 on the 6 God Meet and Greet in Buffalo, AND I scored floor seats for Toronto (best part? I’m going alone, ha). I’m well known on social media as the ‘6 Goddess.'”\nShe continued, “Drake is Toronto. I feel like I live and breathe Toronto. It’s an amazing feeling to be so connected with an artist who musically connects with the city on such an intense level. I actually have one [tattoo] in the works — ‘6 Goddess’ under my other boob.”\nDrizzy has referenced The 6 on other songs throughout his career, including more records onIf You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. On ‘Know Yourself’, he famously raps, “Runnin’ through The 6 with my woes/ Countin’ money, you know how it goes/ Pray the real live forever, man/ Pray the fakes get exposed.”\nHowever, in 2024, Kendrick Lamar took shots at Drake over his self-proclaimed ‘6 God’ name, rapping on his ‘Not Like Us‘ diss track, “Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy/ Freaky-ass n*ggas need to stay they ass inside.” From hero to villain, a nickname can so easily be used for better or worse.",

        "title": "Jon Brion: the man who pushed Kanye West and Mac Miller “to another level”",
        "description": "Jon Brion is a man of many talents, best known for producing for the likes of Fiona Apple and Elliott Smith and scoring films such asEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,MagnoliaandPunch-Drunk Love. However, he’s also dived into the world ofhip-hopand crafted some exceptional bodies of work each time.\nKeen to create something groundbreaking with his second album, Kanye West recruited Brion to co-produce the entirety of 2005’sLate Registration. The project was recorded with an orchestral style, using string arrangements and instruments like a harpsichord, celesta and Chinese bells – something that doesn’t typically go hand in hand with rap music.\nKanye knew he wanted to collaborate with Brion after hearing his work for Michel Gondry and Paul Thomas Anderson’s movies, as well as Apple’s catalogue. “One of the main differences [between]Late RegistrationandCollege Dropout, and every other album for that matter, is the producer Jon Brion,” he said.\n“I actually brought him in to co-produce the entire album. He produced Fiona Apple’s three albums, he produced soundtracks for likeMagnolia,Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind. A musical genius, plays every instrument. And that really pushed me to another level.”\nHe continued, “Even like, not just playing instruments, but say I didn’t want to write a verse, he’ll push me: ‘I need another verse!’ Like really, it was kind of crazy for someone, you know, of my status as a producer, to have someone else producing and really pushing, and I really appreciate that.”\nBrion produced some of the album’s biggest songs, including ‘Gold Digger‘ and ‘Heard ‘Em Say’, as well as other favourites such as ‘Hey Mama’, ‘Diamonds from Sierra Leone’ and ‘Roses’.Late Registrationwon Best Rap Album at the Grammys and is considered one of the classic albums in Kanye’s discography from the 2000s, largely down to Brion’s influence.\n“What was interesting was that [Kanye] wanted to expand himself,” Brion said. “I felt that he was truly trying to make something that would communicate with lots of people but also have qualities in it that weren’t happening in other people’s records at the time.”\nSimilarly to Ye, Mac Miller was also a fan of Brion’s work fromEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, although the Pittsburgh rapper’s initial approach was much more reserved. The pair collaborated on 2018’sSwimming, the last album to be released during Mac’s lifetime. Brion helped write and produce eight out of the 13 songs, which resulted in some of the most mature tracks of his career.\nMac felt insecure the first time he met Brion, believing he had something against hip-hop or people who made beats. “These were his exact words: ‘Oh, yeah. Hi. I really wanted to meet you, but I don’t know if you’d even consider what I do as music,'” Brion toldVulture.\n“That seems absurd, but it was a worry in his head. Because of that, I remember feeling my insides change to this kind of thing, where I just wanted to encourage him immediately. I said, ‘Hey, man. Don’t worry about that. It’s all human expression.'”\nAs time passed, Brion saw a change in Mac’s confidence and began to hear more experimental music he was working on. That was the stuff Brion was most excited to hear when other musicians might not have shown as much interest.\n“There was something different about the work every time he visited,” he said. “I feel like he got more and more comfortable, and he’d play me more of the stuff he was, frankly, maybe nervous about because it wasn’t straight hip-hop, R&B, or pop stuff. I think maybe when he had played that stuff for other people, they weren’t sure what to do. I lit up like a Christmas tree — ‘This is hiding in you?'”\nFollowing Mac’s death, Brion went on to finish his posthumous albumCirclesat the request of his family, given the fact they had already worked together on the songs. “A lot of that stuff is essentially theCirclesmaterial,” he said about the music he was nervous about.\n“As of that point, it was already going to be two albums, but once we were working, he got inspired, and then it was going to be a three-album cycle. He’d picked the stuff he picked forSwimming, and then we had this other pile.” The result was one of the most meticulousposthumous albumsever to be released.",

        "description": "Logicreleased the biggest and most important song of his career in 2017, despite what some of his haters thought of it. With ‘1-800-273-8255′, his collaboration with singers Alessia Cara and Khalid, he went beyond just making music and changed peoples’ lives.\nThe song’s title was the phone number for the American National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL). Although the number changed to “988” in 2022, the old one is still active. Logicwrote the first hook and versefrom the perspective of someone who is suicidal and calling the number.\nHe raps, “All this other shit I’m talkin’ ’bout, they think they know it/ I’ve been praying for somebody to save me, no one’s heroic/ And my life don’t even matter, I know it, I know it/ I know I’m hurting deep down, but can’t show it.”\nThe impact of the song was greater than Logic could have ever imagined. According to theBBC, ‘1-800-273-8255’ led to a huge increase in calls to the helpline. Researchers analysed changes to the daily call volumes at times when the song had a lot of public attention, for example, at the 2018 Grammy Awards and 2017 MTV Video Music Awards. More people began reaching out for help as a result of the song, which possibly decreased suicides, amounting to an estimated 245 people.\n“More than the sales or the money was the feeling that I’d had an impact on the culture,” Logic said in his memoirThe Brighter Future. “Calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline spiked by something like 50%. I wanted to bring these issues of mental health and suicide to the forefront of people’s minds and make them stop and look and pay attention, and I did.” However, the reception wasn’t all positive. Following the MTV VMAs in 2017, Logic admitted that he received a “tsunami of hate” that he couldn’t escape. “The same fans who had heard ‘1-800’ and been like, ‘This is amazing. This is so special. This is needed,’ now were the ones going, ‘This sucks,’ and, ‘He’s too mainstream.’\n“The most popular thing I’d ever done, the song that was going seven times platinum, suddenly became, ‘The worst song Logic ever made.’ As I said it, I kept fighting back the tears and fighting back the tears. Then finally the tears came. I broke down on stage and started crying. And people on the internet made fun of me.”\n‘1-800-273-8255’ peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned nominations for Song of the Year and Best Music Video at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. The visual finds a young gay man struggling with bullying and suicidal feelings before calling for help – it’s been viewed over 451 million times on YouTube since it was released in August 2017.\n“Fans that I met randomly, they’ve said things like, ‘Your music has saved my life. You’ve saved my life,'” he toldGenius. “And I was always like, ‘Aw, so nice of you. Thanks.’ And I give them a hug and shit but in my mind, I’m like, ‘What the fuck?'”\nHe added, “And they’re really serious. And they tat shit on their arms and get shit like lyrics that save their life and in my mind, I was like, ‘Man I wasn’t even trying to save nobody’s life.’ And then it hit me, the power that I have as an artist with a voice. I wasn’t even trying to save your life. Now, what can happen if I actually did?”",

        "title": "‘The College Dropout’: How Kanye West delivered the best debut album in hip-hop history",
        "description": "After years of producing,Kanye Westintroduced himself to the world as an artist in 2004 with his debut album,The College Dropout. Ye shifted from a production career into a fully fledged artist, recording the album over four years starting in 1999.\nThe Chicago rapper signed to Roc-A-Fella in 2002 after proving himself with beats for the likes of Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel and Cam’ron. The title of the album simply came from him dropping out of the American Academy of Art and Chicago State University.\n“I’m a college dropout. That’s the album title,” he toldComplex. “I’ve thought about calling my shit ‘I’m Good,’ because that’s a ‘cool’ title. But for me to try and put on the facade of being the coolest motherfucker ever, it’s not going to come across like that. I’m not saying I’m the coolest motherfucker ever, I’m just saying I’m just a fucking smart-arse. I got to put it in raps.”\nThe first single, ‘Through the Wire‘, was recorded after the rapper experienced a near-fatal car crash when he fell asleep behind the wheel. Kanye was taken to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and had his jaw wired to his face during reconstructive surgery. He started rapping the lyrics to the song three days after the accident and recorded the track just two weeks later with his jaw wired shut.\n“The only thing this accident is saying is, ‘I am about to hand you the world, just know at any given time I can take it away from you,'” he said toYahoo Musicat the time. “To nearly lose your life, to nearly lose your mouth, your voice, your whole face, as a rapper, and I had to be on TV! My face looks crazy to me now, but I have to just thank God for the situation that I am in. ‘Through The Wire’ is the worst thing that could’ve possibly happened to me, and now it’s obviously the best thing. Look how it exploded!”\nThe College Dropoutdebuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart with 441,000 copies in its first week. The album was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the Grammy Awards in 2005, winning in the latter category. Since its release,The College Dropouthas been certified platinum four times by the Recording Industry Association of America.\nBuilt around skits, now a lost art in the album format, the project featured a number of notable guests like Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Common, Ludacris, Talib Kweli, Freeway, GLC and Consequence. The album had a combination of hits such as ‘All Falls Down’ and ‘Jesus Walks’, as well as songs like ‘Family Business’, a more intimate record about the intricacies of family dynamics.\nAlthough Kanye is confident in his abilities, he is self-aware enough to know that he doesn’t have an interesting backstory like selling drugs. “I ain’t trying to front. I’m aware of shit,” he said. “Am I supposed to get here and say, ‘Yo man, I sold drugs and I did this?’ Because I never did none of that. Is that automatically going to lower my record sales like crazy because I said I never sold crack? I apologise. I just went and got a job. Whatever.”\nHe continued, ”What the fuck I look like rapping? How did I end up on Roc-A-Fella? I never had a good voice. I never really had a good rapper story. I wasn’t ever that much of a pimp where I just had mad girls. I never was shooting at n*ggas, so what was it? It was just focus. I decided I want to do this.”\nThe College Dropoutserved as the blueprint for Kanye’s career, going on to release more classic albums such asLate Registration,Graduation,808s & Heartbreak,My Beautiful Dark Twisted FantasyandYeezus. If it wasn’t for the success of his debut, we might not have had the opportunity to experience one of the best runs in hip-hop.",

        "title": "Which rappers have asked Donald Trump for a criminal pardon?",
        "description": "During his presidency,Donald Trumphas partnered with many rappers to gain the support of the people of the United States. As someone who can pardon those behind bars, hip-hop artists have often attempted to secure their freedom through the controversial figure.\nKanye West onceshowed his support for Trumpbefore launching his own political party, paying a visit to the Oval Office in 2018 and having dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022. The president described him as “really complicated” during a conversation with Adin Ross, but still complemented his intent. “He is a really nice guy but he can get himself into trouble and he can get some other people. But he’s got a good heart.”\nIn 2019, A$AP Rocky was arrested in Sweden and held without bail, promptingTrump to come to his defenceon social media. Trump called for his freedom, claiming he was “very disappointed” in Sweden’s treatment of the African-American community. Once released, Trump wrote on X, “It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!”\n“I was kinda scared that Trump was going to fuck it up,” Rocky said in hisStockholm Syndromedocumentary. “But on the other hand, I kinda was like ‘That’s what’s up.’ I mean, you want the most support you [can]. When the president supports you, I felt good. For the most part, I don’t think he ever knows what’s going on in the urban communities or the urban divisions of this political shit.”\nHowever, he called it a “chess” move on Trump’s part, claiming he didn’t do much. “They tried to strong-arm a lot and in reality, I had no problem saying ‘thank you’ to the man, especially if he helped me, but that was the narrative they were pushing — that he got me out. He didn’t free me. If anything, he made it a little worse.”\nTrump alsobrought Lil Pump on stageduring a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 2020, pronouncing his name wrong. “Speaking of sound, music and other things, one of the big superstars of the world, Little Pimp,” he said. “There he is. How’s it going? You want to come up and say something? Come on, Little Pump, come on up here.”\nBoosie Badazz hasrequested a pardon from Trumpseveral times relating to his federal gun case in San Diego. “Trump check my case out,” he said on X. “My case was dismissed but Biden’s DOJ recharged me with the same gun charge Biden pardon his son of.”\nHe continued, “I was told I am the only person in the country facing that charge now. President Trump, I already was given a 10 year sentence n state n 2009 for 3rd offense marijuana (grams, grams, grams). I never was even offered rehab straight to prison.”\nIn the final hours of his first presidency in 2021, Trump pardoned Lil Wayne, who pleaded guilty to a federal weapons charge, and Kodak Black, who was charged with falsifying information on federal forms to buy firearms.\nWayne thanked Trumpon social media, writing, “I want to thank President Trump for recognising that I have so much more to give to my family, my art, and my community. I also want to thank Bradford Cohen for working so diligently to secure another chance for me. Love!”\nKodak also showed his appreciation for Trump, saying, “I want to thank the president, Donald Trump, for his commitment to justice reform and shortening my sentence. I also want to thank everyone for their support and love. It means more than you will ever know. I want to continue giving back, learning and growing.”\nBradford Cohen, the attorney for both rappers, praised Trump, tellingRolling Stone, “President Trump and his administration have been tireless advocates on behalf of the African-American community. These pardons are a perfect example of this administration following up on its reforms and commitments.”",

        "title": "The real reason everyone is taking shots at Drake",
        "description": "Drakehas been one of the most prominent hip-hop artists for over a decade, but last year, he was knocked off the top spot by Compton legend Kendrick Lamar. The two MCs battled it out on the mic but the culture made sure to let it be known that Drizzy had lost his crown and, slowly but surely, he became a total pariah in hip-hop.\nThat said,Drake’s downfall didn’t just begin last year,and there are numerous reasons the Toronto native eventually fell from grace. However, one of the unanswered questions is “Why?” The reason why people hate Drake is slightly opaque, but many figures have spoken about it in their raps.\nTheScorpioncreator has had beef with a lot of hip-hop’s heavy-hitters. Last year, he had his spat with Kendrick Lamar, but what many fail to acknowledge is that the song that started the war, ‘Like That,’ featured Future, who has had issues with Drizzy for a while.\nOn the title track ofWe Don’t Like You, Future’s joint album with Metro Boomin’, the Atlanta rapper took several shots at Drake. On the title track, he raps, “Fake written all over you/Hate written all over you.” He then adds, “You a n*gga’s number one fan, dog / Sneak dissin’, I don’t understand, dog / Pillow talkin’, actin’ like a fed, dog / I don’t need another fake friend, dog / Can’t be ’bout a h*e, ’cause we sharin’, dog / In you feelings, n*gga, why you playin’, dog?”\nFuture and Drake’s under-wraps feud didn’t come out of nowhere as on his 2023 projectFor All The DogsDrake had a verse referencing the ‘Mask Off’ emcee, rapping, “What would Pluto do? / He’d f*ck a h*e / So did it (Yeah, yeah).”\nIn addition to Future, Drake has had a well-known ongoing feud with Pusha T. The 2018 war of words, which culminated in ‘The Story of Adidon’,saw Pusha T destroy Drake,and the consensus across hip-hop was that Drizzy had been defeated.\nThe revelation that Drake had a son was a body blow for the Scorpion creator as he had not only hidden Adonis for years but also kept his previous relationship with Sophie Brussaux (a former adult film star) a secret.\nAs Joe Budden highlighted on his podcastThe Joe Budden Show,Drake’s power and cultural capital were once so great that he could disrespect people without any pushback. Furthermore, Budden asserted that Drizzy did most of this behind-the-scenes. However, a lot of it has spilt over into the mainstream.\nDrake has had issues with Joe Budden, Kanye West, Pusha T, Future, Pharrell, Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross, Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky and many more. So, although some of his beefs were more public-facing than others, he has rubbed many people in the industry up the wrong way.\nAnother reason Drizzy is on the end of so much hate at the moment is due to his client podcasters. More specifically, DJ Akademiks. The Twitch streamer and cultural commentator is one of the most controversial and hated voices in hip-hop, and the fact that he actively promotes Drake and defends him has only added to people’s frustration with Drake himself.\nTheViewsrhymer has started beefs centred around Nicki Minaj, Rihanna and, to a lesser extent, has been accused of being a culture vulture for attempting to steal the styles of musicians from various countries.\nThe downfall of Drake and the aftermath of shots we are seeing go his way was a somewhat inevitable result of his grandstanding within rap music. What goes up must come down and it appears the industry was beyond tired of the behind-the-scenes shenanigans the fans hear so much about.",

        "title": "Why does John Lennon’s son hate Drake?",
        "description": "It will always be difficult to follow in the footsteps of a father who’s considered one of the greatest musicians of all time. Case in point: Sean Ono Lennon, who’s the son of Beatles legend, John Lennon. Over the past year, Sean has been vocal about the beef betweenDrakeand Kendrick Lamar, falling firmly on the side of K. Dot. Although there’s no rhyme or reason, it feels strange that Sean would have any public opinion whatsoever.\n49-year-old Sean accepted the award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package at the 2025 Grammys for his art director role in the reissue of his father’s 1973 album,Mind Games. At the end of his speech, he took a moment to address the rap beef that’s dominating headlines. “And finally, you know, I’m getting older in my middle age, and I just wanted to give some advice to the young people out there,” he said. “Never get into a rap battle with Kendrick Lamar. Thank you.”\nKendrickwon five Grammys that nightfor his Drizzy diss track ‘Not Like Us’ in the ‘Record of the Year’, ‘Song of the Year’, ‘Best Rap Song’, ‘Best Rap Performance’ and ‘Best Music Video’ categories. While this may have been the first time many witnessed Sean’s bashing of Drake, it was far from his first rodeo.\nSean was tuned into his battle with Kendrick at the height of their beef in May 2024, when they quickly exchanged diss tracks. Taking to social media at the time, he mentioned several bubbling hip-hop beefs while referencing Drake’s need for ghostwriters to have any chance of winning against Kendrick.\n“Meanwhile in rap beef news: No matter what Chris Brown is like as a person you have to admit his diss track on Quavo was hard,” he wrote on X. “Kendrick’s diss track on Drake was so sophisticated Drake’s gonna need his entire team of writers to make a come back. Nicki Minaj still hasn’t recovered fromMegan Thee Stallion’s line about Megan’s Law. I wish everyone well on all sides.”\nHe added, “As long as it stays musical and doesn’t get physical I love me some beef.” When someone criticised rap beefs, claiming Lionel Ritchie wouldn’t have insulted Stevie Wonder, he replied, “You should watchTales from the Tour Bus. Think you’d be surprised.”\nSean later judged Drake fortakinglegal action against Universal Music Groupafter he accused them of boosting streams of Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’. “Drake suing UMG is the biggest L in rap battle history,” he said about his pre-action filings.\nShortly before the Grammys, Sean also said, “Someone should check on Drake,” in another X post. When a follower asked what the latest update was in their beef, Sean replied, “Deafening silence,” while claiming Drake was in “spiritual jail.”\nHe also came to Jay-Z’s defence when someone said Jay-Z should be checked on, referencing hisrape lawsuit. “Please do not even imply a comparison of Drake to Jay-Z,” he wrote. “They are not in the same stratosphere.” Despite misunderstanding the point of the message, one thing was clear: Drake doesn’t deserve to be put among the great rappers, according to Sean.\nSean is clearly a hip-hop fan based on his knowledge of Chris Brown, Quavo, Nicki Minaj, and Megan Thee Stallion. He could also just think Kendrick is a better lyricist than Drake in general. But his bold opinion could also be due to how Drake has disrespected The Beatles over the years.\nIn 2019, Drake got a controversial tattoo of The Beatles afterbeating various chart recordsset by the band. To mark the occasion, he got some ink inspired by theAbbey Roadcover but instead included an image of himself waving goodbye to the group. The year before, he rapped, “I got more slaps than The Beatles,” on Meek Mill’s ‘Going Bad’.\nAll of this could contribute to Sean’s general perception of Drake. However, more recently, Lennon and McCartney receivedwriting credits on Drake’s ‘Champagne Poetry’for interpolating their 1965 song ‘Michelle’ from theRubber Soulalbum.\nKendrick, on the other hand, has only had good things to say about The Beatles. He once put the Fab Four on a high pedestal while stating that he wanted his 2015 albumTo Pimp a Butterflyto go down in history books. “I wanted this record to be talked about the same was Bob Dylan or The Beatles or Jimi Hendrix are talked about,” he toldNME. “When my time has come, I want it to live longer than me, for the grandkids and their kids.”\nIt also happens that another Beatle, Paul McCartney, co-wrote a song with Kendrick years ago. Macca was elated when he looked at the credits of Kanye West’s ‘All Day’, which includes a re-recorded sample of ‘When the Wind Is Blowing’, to find out Kendrick was involved.\n“Just the other day I happened to look at the writing credits and there’s about 50 people!” he toldDIY Magazine. “There were only three of them I knew and one of them’s Kendrick Lamar! I’m thinking, ‘I’ve written a song with Kendrick Lamar?!’ I wish I’d met him! But that’s just the way they do it these days.”\n“I want to give some advice to the young people out there…Never get into a rap battle with Kendrick Lamar.”— Sean Ono Lennon during his#Grammysspeechpic.twitter.com/Ck6gz1GZrB",

        "title": "Why was Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime so bad?",
        "description": "Many have praisedKendrick Lamar’sSuper Bowl halftime performance, and some have even suggested that it could be one of the best hip-hop halftime shows ever. However, many people didn’t enjoy it or particularly understand it. It is undoubtedly true that Kendrick Lamar is a talented emcee who has fantastic songs. Still, his Super Bowl performance was underwhelming, to say the least.\nAlthough Kendrick Lamar’s messaging was very on brand, and the Easter eggs, including much of the symbolism, were ingenious, his choice of tracks and special appearances was more than poor. Many songs that made the culture fall in love with the Compton lyricist were missing, and the entire showseemed like a build-up to the performance of ‘Not Like Us’.\nUnlike Dr Dre’s 2022 halftime performance, K Dot didn’t meticulously guide viewers through his career from 2009 to now but instead placed a heavy emphasis on his most recent material. This, if anything, made the show feel like a recap of the last five years as opposed to a phased journey through his life musically. As a thoroughbred TDE Compton rapper, many people in the culture assumed he would throwback to his days as a member of the Black Hippy collective and maybe show love to MCs such as Ab-Soul, Jay Rock and ScHoolboy Q, but this wasn’t the case. Furthermore, people thought that he might offer up a surprise like ‘HiiiPower’, his highly acclaimed 2011 debut single, but that wasn’t the case.\nFans got a surprise appearance from Serena Williams and knew precisely why she was there. However, it again was tied to ‘Not Like Us’ and his feud with Drake, which unfortunately overshadowed the whole performance.\nAs a simple onlooker, it appears that much of the lyricist’s performance was geared towards Drake. TheDAMNcreator wore a chain with the musical symbol for “A-minor”, and several dancers had flags to the same effect. However, in no way did any of these things encapsulate Lamar’s illustrious career prior to 2024. Beloved trackssuch as ‘Backseat Freestyle’ and ‘Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe’were noticeably absent. The artist also didn’t perform one song from his beloved albumTo Pimp A Butterfly.\nWhile Lamar performed zero songs from his first three projects, he chose instead to perform a slew of songs from his 2024 albumGNXand two diss tracks. One of his special guests was SZA, with whom he will soon be going on tour. It lacked the sense of journey that a Super Bowl halftime show requires. Although Dr Dre has had a longer career than Lamar, he showed every step of his career with his setlist so fans could sonically arrive at the present and brought out artists who have been essential to his life, such as Snoop Dogg, Eminem and 50 Cent.\nMeanwhile, K Dot brought out the vocalist, who will join him on tour for a quasi-promotional performance. Whether it’sSection.80, Good Kid m.A.A.D CityorTo Pimp A Butterfly,Kendrick left out vast swathes of his catalogue in favour of more current and recent music, which really didn’t showcase his full talent.\nUnfortunately, despite the exceptional metaphors with “Uncle Sam” and the US flag, the setlist made Lamar’s performance feel like a televisedGNXlistening party with a hint ofDAMNovershadowed by a beef that should have taken a back seat.\n‘Not Like Us’ was an essential song to play, but ‘Euphoria’ was not. Some older material would have gone a long way in showing his musical arc, and the over-emphasis on jabs at Drake wasn’t necessary, considering he has already been declared the winner in the feud.",

        "title": "Is Kanye West still a respectable musician?",
        "description": "The downfall ofKanye Westhas been slow and painful to watch. The formerly respected musician has been relatively volatile in his behaviour both publicly and behind the scenes, and since the release ofJesus Is Kingin 2019, there has been a marked and significant downturn in the quality of his music.\nAfter his collaboration with Lil Pump in 2018 for ‘I Love It’, West claimed that he would begin making more  music that is more aligned with his “Christian values.” However, this version of Kanye was short-lived. Every timethe Chicago nativemakes an appearance, he seems to show fans a different version of himself and many previous fans feel that they have lost the West of old.\nThe change in Ye’s life seemed to occur when he married Kim Kardashian. Although it didn’t immediately change his sound, it undoubtedly made the rapper more sheltered, and despite his wife’s outward-facing role as a model and influencer, he rarely seemed to appear alongside her.\nWest has always been political. However, his politics were not the centre of his brand, and since 2016, he has chosen to alienate vast swathes of his fan base by promoting Donald Trump and supporting both his presidential bids. That said, many lifelong Ye fans saw it coming, considering his rhetoric towards George W Bush after Hurricane Katrina.\nTheCollege Dropoutcreator has never been afraid to speak truth to power. However, as he amassed more money and became more exposed to the business world, it is safe to say that the West developed somewhat of an obsession with money, power, and those who have it.\nWhether it’s his previous obsession with Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, Donald Trump or Elon Musk, Ye showed an unhealthy desire to be part of America’s billionaire upper echelon. From screaming at Sway Calloway in an interview about business to getting frustrated with Charlamagne Tha God for calling out his money-hungry ways, the ‘Good Life’ rhymer showed us the signs before the manic meltdown.\nIt is undeniable that he displayed creepy tendencies here and there before. His 2016 video for ‘Famous’ was not only polarising but lambasted by many as “distasteful.” However, at the time, people chalked it up to his “creative genius”, which is perhaps a mistake the culture made with Kanye West for too long.\nWest is undoubtedly talented. However, it is clear now that after decades of nothing but praise, he has developed a messianic complex that has ingrained itself so deeply in his head that he is willing to commit acts of self-destruction on an unprecedented scale.\nHis 2018TMZrant was an eye-opener for many hip-hop fans, and his “slavery was a choice” comment, which he recently reiterated via X (formerly Twitter), was previously unchartered territory, and he didn’t like the pushback he got. Since that moment, every Kanye West album has seen diminishing returns and widely negative feedback.\nIn fact, his divorce from Kim Kardashian only fuelled the decline in the quality of his material. Still, 2022 could be considered the last year of Kanye West and the beginning of the “Ye era.” His actions and their ramifications were so visible, and the fallout happened so quickly that it was pretty jaw-dropping to watch.\nTheGraduationcreatorwas happy to have millions taken off the table, brand deals and endorsements cancelled, and his name tarnished due to a firmly held belief that a certain demographic of people was purposely destroying his life. In his rants onDrink Champsand the controversial podcastInfowars,West preached about Ari Emanuel, Lyor Cohen and the so-called evils of Jewish people in the music industry, and he continues to dig himself into a hole.\nThe figure of Kanye West once held a certain prestige. However, it is fair to say that since 2018, he has willingly destroyed people’s perceptions of him. With repeated stunts, such as the controversy he was recently involved in at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, hip-hop and pop culture, more broadly, are positively numb to his shenanigans.\nVultures 1andVultures 2were not received well, and they were two underwhelming bodies of work. Concerning respect, many draw a cut-off line and distinguish a Kanye of old from the current iteration of Ye we currently have.",

        "title": "Dr Dre once revealed the one music category he hated being put in",
        "description": "Business mogul and legendary producerDr Drehas made all sorts of music across his 30-year career. However, some of his most notable work was alongside his West Coast peers as part of the collective N.W.A. The collective’s 1988 debut album,Straight Outta Compton, sent shockwaves throughout the US and put California firmly on the map concerning rap music.\nThe LA group was known for its raw and aggressive style, which reflected the crime-ridden neighbourhoods from which it came. However, as the ensemble’s primary producer and musical visionary, Dre didn’t like the media’s response to its music, especially when it was labelled as “gangsta Rap.”\nThe labelling of certain genres and artists has always been an issue in hip-hop. Whether it’s the term “stoner rap” or “mumble rap”, musicians don’t like it when critics attempt to put them in a box. However, in the 1980s,“gangsta rap” as a label stuck and led to an unfathomableamount of hysteria from older White Americans.\nNot only was the term hyperbolic, but it wasn’t accurate. Many of the earliest MCs from the subgenre were merely surrounded by the activities they rapped of. Nevertheless, the name “gangsta rap” insinuated that its creators were all gangsters and heartless criminals.\nIt is unsurprising that Dr Dre didn’t like the term. However, the term continued to plague musical discourse for the next 20 years. But after the turn of the millennium things did undoubtedly ease up a little.\nOver the years, many MCs have been called gangsta rappers. From 2Pac to 50 Cent and more, the term has come to mean a style of lyricism that focuses solely on criminal activity and murder. However, Dre during the 1980s, Dre knew that his intentions were pure when he made music.\nThe same has been said by many other artists. In a 2017 interview withDrink Champs, the godfather of the subgenre, Ice-T, stated, “It wasn’t gangsta rap. It was reality rap. It wasn’t everyone’s reality, but it was my reality. I was just rapping for the people in my area.”\nDuring his interview with Kevin Hart for hisHart To Hearttelevision series, Dr Dre explained, “I’ve never liked it being called gangsta rap. That’s never what we went in to do. We [were] just making hardcore hip-hop, that’s all. I don’t know what it got that title or who gave it that title.”\nFigures such as Ice Cube and Ice-t have attributed the title to the fact that Los Angeles’ gang culture has always been normalised, widespread and potent for much longer than any other region of the US, so when the gangsters made music, they just labelled it “Gangsta Rap.”\nAccording to many, in the modern-day, gangsta rap is dead, and many cite the 2007 sales battle between Kanye West and 50 Cent as the death of the subgenre with 50 Cent’s low sales showing the loss of its appeal.\nThat said, there has always been a pocket of hip-hop where violence takes centre stage, and much of the drill music from Chicago is evidence of this. However, for now, it appears that the culture wants meaningful and heartfelt projects from Kendrick Lamar.",

        "description": "Kendrick Lamarput on a spectacular halftime show at the Super Bowl over the weekend. Special guests included SZA, Mustard, and even legendary actor Samuel L Jackson. Another surprising inclusion was the appearance of tennis legend Serena Williams, but there’s more than what meets the eye as to why she was there.\nOne of the night’s many highlights was Kendrick’s performance of his number-one single, ‘Not Like Us‘, which is famously a diss track towards Drake. “I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they love to sue,” Kendrick said earlier in the night, referencing Drake’s lawsuit against Universal Music Group.\nDuring his eventual performance of the song, Kendrick rapped, “Say, Drake, I hear you like ‘em young,” while smiling. Although he didn’t call Drake a paedophile on stage, the crowd gleefully sang along when he rapped, “Tryna strike a chord, and it’s probably A minor.”\nWhile he was performing ‘Not Like Us’, the camera panned to Williams,who was Crip-walkingto the song while wearing a blue outfit, the retired tennis star did a similar dance when she defeated Maria Sharapova at the Olympics in London in 2012, sparking controversy at the time due to its gang origins.\n“Let’s go Super Bowl halftime??! I died a little!” she wrote on social media after the Super Bowl, adding in a video, “Man, I did not Crip walk like that at Wimbledon. Oooh, I would’ve been fined! It was all love.”\nDrake dated Williams in 2011, so it appears that Kendrick took the opportunity to invite her onto the stage totake a dig at his hip-hop rival. The pair were romantically linked between 2011 and 2015, with Drizzy often publicly supporting Williams at her tennis matches.\nFollowing their breakup, Drake revealed that his 2016 song ‘Too Good’ was about his relationship with Williams. In the chorus, he sings, “I’m too good to you/ I’m way too good to you/ You take my love for granted/ I just don’t understand it.”\nHe also mentioned her by name on his 2022 track ‘Middle of the Ocean’, rapping in the song, “Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie/ He claim we don’t got a problem but/ No, boo, it is like you comin’ for sushi.”\nHer husband, Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, responded to Drake’s lyrics on X (formerly Twitter). “The reason I stay winning is because I’m relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do – including being the best groupie for my wife and daughter,” he wrote. “It’s cliche, but life changed when I became a husband + papa. It’s made me 100x better as a man and a businessman.”\nAt the 2024 ESPY Awards, Williams referencedDrake and Kendrick’s beefon stage, claiming Kendrick was making a laughing stock out of her ex. “If I’ve learned anything this year, it’s that none of us, not a single one of us, not even me, should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar,” she said. “He will make your hometown not like you. The next time Drake sits courtside at a [Toronto] Raptors game, they’re going to Forrest Gump him. Seats taken.”\nCommon was in a relationship with Williams between 2007 and 2010 and believed that was the cause of Drake dissing him. “I don’t know what motivated him to send me some shots but I think what for sure had me, if I’m just being real, like you know, we mess with one of the same girls,” he said onDrink Champs.\nHe continued, “You know wars happen over women. That’s just what it is. I ain’t going to get at you if you with somebody I was with. But if you start throwing me a couple little, you know, you trying to throw some jabs, then I’m like, ‘Come on, man, OK.’”\nNot only did Williams date Drake, but she also grew up in Compton, the same place Kendrick is from, bringing the whole thing full circle.\nSerena Williams had to pop off with Kendrick during “Not Like Us”Compton’s finest 😤pic.twitter.com/9OIvVcmNnR",

Not only was it entertaining, but it also saw two of the highest-selling rappers enter a lyrical battle that kept fans on the edge of their seats. Not only did the diss songs dominate social media, but the diss tracks landed on the Billboard Hot 100 on multiple occasions.\nHowever, the ill-will between the MCs went unnoticed for years, and the two acts merely avoided each other for over a decade. Still, the underlying bad blood was always there, and last year, it finally became visible to fans.\nKendrick and Drake have definitely made their feelings about each other clear through some clever, sneaky lyrics over the years. While it’s hard to pinpoint precisely when the tension started, many believe Drake’s feelings were sparked by a line in Kendrick’s 2013 song, ‘Control’, where he called out 11 fellow artists, including Mac Miller, Tyler The Creator, Meek Mill, and, of course, Drizzy. In one verse, he raps, “I got love for you all, but I’m tryna murder you n*ggas.”\nAlthough Kendrick Lamar’s intention was not to offend, merely pay homage, Drake took it personally and, in an interview withBillboardmagazine, stated, “It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That’s all it was. I know good and well that Kendrick’s not murdering me, at all, in any platform.”\nThat said, Lamar subtly responded to Drake’s spiky interview but on a larger platform. In a televised BET Hip-Hop Cypher, which annually showcases the best new lyricists in hip-hop, Kendrick responded to theBillboardinterview by sneakily referencing Drake’s 2013 album,Nothing Was The Same, rapping, “Yeah and nothing’s been the same since they dropped ‘Control’, And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes.”\nTwo years later, Drake responded on his mixtape,If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.On the song’ 6pm In New York’ the Toronto native rhymed, I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe / Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside / Oh you tried, it’s so childish calling my name on the world stage / You need to act your age and not your girl’s age.”\nStill, Lamar subtly jabbed at Drake on ‘King Kunta’, and until 2024, their jibes were subliminal. That said, while diss tracks were getting exchanged last year, many fans wondered if the battle signified the end of Drake and Kendrick’s beef.\nUnfortunately, the ball is totally in Drizzy’s court.‘Not Like Us’ seemed like the perfect way to wrap up the feud,but with all the damage it’s done to Drake’s career, he might try anything to salvage his brand. From court cases to diss records, there is still a lot of time, and theScorpioncreator is likely to try and manoeuvre himself out of what is an embarrassing position, to say the least.\nIf the ‘Best I Ever Had’ rhymer persists with hisdefamation case against Universal Music Group,he will not permanently affect Lamar in any way. However, if he records and releases a truly devastating diss track, he could claw his way back into hip-hop culture. Still, the latter is highly unlikely, if not impossible.\nFor now, it appears Drake is focused on UMG and not Lamar. As such, it is over for now. However, there is still a slim chance he could revive it to save himself.",

        "title": "Behind the Mic: The story behind Drake’s ‘Forever’",
        "description": "Drakelanded one of the biggest collaborations of his career in 2009 before he had even released his debut album,Thank Me Later. The Toronto rapper teamed up with Kanye West, Eminem and his mentor, Lil Wayne, on ‘Forever’ in August that year, peaking at number eight on the Hot 100. At the time, Drake was buzzing off the success of hisSo Far Gonemixtape, singles ‘Over’ and ‘Find Your Love’, and signing to Young Money Entertainment.\n‘Forever’, produced by Boi-1da, was originally a Kardinal Offishall beat in early 2008, recording an unreleased song called ‘Bring It Back’. However, Drake later acquired the song after Kardinal didn’t include it on his album, recruiting Ye, Em, and Weezy for the track to appear on the soundtrack toMore than a Game, a documentary film aboutNBA star LeBron James.\n“Me and Gee [Roberson, Drake’s former manager] talked about the song,” Drake told DJ Drama. “Melody and message-wise, we thought it would be dope to put someone on there. Originally, we thought Kanye. But then the powers that be started having a lunch or two together, and they put it together.”\nHe continued, “With a new Wayne verse, Interscope stepped in, and we had that great look from Eminem. It’s like you have the option to make a song or the option to make a moment. And it was one of those calls on that end – let’s just make this something for people to remember.”\nDrake, Kanye, Wayne and Em all spit verses on the record, with Drizzy also singing the hook. The 6 God famously raps in the first verse, “Last name Ever, first name Greatest/ Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain’t nothin’ to play with.”\nMost of the music video was filmed at Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, Florida, except Eminem’s part, which was shot in Detroit due to scheduling conflicts.Acclaimed director Hype Williamswas behind the visual, which featured cameo appearances from Birdman, The Alchemist, Slaughterhouse, Mr. Porter, Trick-Trick, Bizarre, Kuniva, and others.\nDrake revealed that Wayne’s “Life is such a roller coaster” line was his favourite on the song, but still gave praise to everyone else. “Everybody does their thing,” he said. “Kanye does Kanye. Eminem raps in a way where nobody might have heard him rap in a long time and says some things that are great for his fans to hear. I’m just proud to even be on the record. People are telling me they like my verse. I’m just happy I held my own.”\nKanye once admitted that after hearing Em’s verse, he went back and rewrote his lyrics for two days to match his ability. He cared so much that he even cancelled appointments to focus on the verse.\n“Everybody approached the beat different,” Eminem toldComplex. “Kanye was crazy, too, and Wayne. I just saw the beat differently than anybody else did; for some reason, I felt like the beat was a double-time beat, so I rapped faster.”\nAs well as theMore than a Gamesoundtrack, ‘Forever’ also appeared onRelapse: Refill, a reissue of Em’s 2009 album that included seven additional tracks. The song received plaudits from rap peers, with Jay-Z describing it as “the best posse cut of the decade.”",

        "title": "Why ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ is the greatest DMX song ever made",
        "description": "The lateDMXwas an unstoppable force in his prime who seemed able to make anthems with ease. From ‘What’s My Name?’ to ‘Where the Hood At?’, the Yonkers rapper was an unparalleled hit-maker. Still, some of his songs are undoubtedly better than others, and, in the eyes of many, one track truly epitomises X, and that is his 1998 hit ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’.\nThis single doesn’t just mark hip-hop’s first real introduction to DMX; it actually represents a lot more. The rise of Ruff Ryders in hip-hop was something to behold, and their grip on the mainstream was unprecedented.With exciting and fresh instrumentals from Swizz Beatz, the collective turned heads almost immediately, and ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ was the start.\nNot only is the track one of DMX’s most well-known songs, but it was so impactful that it’s played in clubs to this day. With ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem,’ DMX took a completely different approach from his hip-hop counterparts.\nUnlike Jay-Z, Fat Joe and other New York acts, X didn’t present himself as a smooth, cigar-smoking mafia mob boss who had made it out of the hood. Instead, with his top off, sweating, he aggressively stared down the barrel of the camera, surrounded by rowdy gangs of people and brought the streets to the screen in the most literal way possible.\nThe beauty of ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ is in its simplicity. With a simple drum pattern, sparse bass melody and basic guitar loop, it allowed DMX to take front and centre and the song’s energy is solely down to him. It’s rare for a rapper to produce such a weighty track with so little instrumentation. However, it’s the aggression and attack of X himself that makes the song hit as hard as it does.\nOnly Noreaga had previously tried to release a single to this effect with ‘Superthug’, yet that 1998 song is a relic, while ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ lives on as an iconic and legendary track. Many would argue that DMX has had bigger hits, which might be true just by the numbers. However, ‘Ruff Ryders Anthems’ has cultural value and is the late emcee’s most culturally impactful track and the greatest.\nStrangely, DMX didn’t even put that much time into the track that helped him break the mainstream. In an interview withGQ, the late lyricist disclosed that he wrote the lyrics in about 15 minutes after getting the instrumental from Swizz Beats but, after writing it, wasn’t feeling it, claiming “The beat was simple and repetitive”, telling the interviewer, “I had so many other songs with more substance. The song is like ABCs, like elementary.”\nStill, Swizz Beatz knew, much like the Neptunes did in the early 2000s, that even the simplest instrumentals can be hypnotising and highly satisfying to listen to, more so when the artist rapping on it is a captivating emcee.\nAlthough the producer knew this, DMX wasn’t keen on anything about the track. Detailing how it was recorded, Swizz Beatz once revealed, “He didn’t wanna do the song. He lost a bet to my uncle Darrin in a card game, and my uncle Darrin [had] said, ‘[If] you lose the bet, you do the song.'”\nHowever, it made him a phenomenon, and Swizz Beatz highlighted this, adding, “So if you listen to the song, he’s kind of irritated on the song, but he didn’t lose the bet because it became ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’, and that crossed him over into a whole other world towhere he was doing Woodstock!”\nThe love of ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ was only boosted when X dropped the video. With DMX being an avid rider, he sought to capture New York’s underground biker culture with the track’s video, so for ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’, he wanted to take it to the street. The video was shot outside with Ruff Ryders members and their associates and featured them riding quads and dirtbikes, which captivated audiences.\nTo this day, the track is considered a classic, and the wave that followed featuring Swizz Beatz, Eve and The LOX was extraordinary.",

        "title": "The Story Behind the Sample: A Tribe Called Quest, The Fugees and ‘Memory Band’ by Rotary Connection",
        "description": "Hip hopwas born from the soul and funk genres that dug their roots into New Orleans and spread rapidly across America throughout the 20th Century. The then-emerging genre is now one of the most distinctly recognisable types of music globally. This is due to its universal characteristics that define rap within its own realm, characteristics like sampling.\nSampling is one of the fine arts of the genre and is also one of, if not the foundational aspect, that hip-hop has built upon. DJ Kool Herc has come to be known as the ‘Father of Hip Hop’ and for good reason. At his sister’s back-to-school party on Sedgwick Avenue in 1973, he would throw the stone that changed the course of music forever as he mixed his records on the turntables.\nThe invention of mixing became a cornerstone of rap and led to the creation of sampling. The idea of taking something old and turning it into something new is a practice that almost every artist utilises today. The better and more niche the sample, the more fans applaud.\nBy the 1990s, sampling was common practice. It was also common to hear hip-hop collectiveA Tribe Called Queston every radio station as they pumped out record after record of rap genius. The group saw unheard-of instant success off the back of their 1990 debut albumPeople’s Instinctive Travels and Paths of Rhythm. The track most associated with the album is undoubtedly ‘Can I Kick It?’, but another of the standout songs is ‘Bonita Applebum’. Whenever this single is named, fans will instantly think of the iconic four sitar plucks that kick off the beat.\nDepending on where your allegiances lay in the ‘90s, though, that guitar strum might make you think of a different group. In 1996, The Fugees released their iconic albumThe Score, their second and final release. If sampling was made for hip-hop, The Fugees were made for sampling. The collective is notorious for its heavy use of sampling and completely remixing songs.\nIt made sense then that the trio looked towards one of the other dominant groups of the time for inspiration. In truth, they shared a lot of similarities with Tribe as they both produced more of a chilled sound and discussed theoretical, philosophical and political topics in their lyrics.\nThe New Jersey collaborative included potentially their biggest song on the 1996 record, ‘Killing Me Softly’. Following Lauren Hill’s opening vocals, the flow and verses are introduced by none other than the same four strings. They directly sampled both the hook and beat from ‘Bonita Applebum’, but the sitar introduction is arguably just as synonymous with ‘Killing Me Softly’ due to its massive popularity.\nSo, where did this iconic sitar sound come from? The answer is a 1967 track called ‘Memory Band’ by American psychedelic soul band Rotary Connection. Rotary Connection was the experimental brainchild of Marshall Chess, son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. Marshall was attempting to start up his own production company and, taking inspiration from Chess Records, wanted to focus on soul and blues sounds with a then-modern twist.\nThe group, who notably included famous soul singer Minnie Riperton before her individual success, released their self-titled debut album in 1967 that included ‘Memory Band’.Rotary Connectiontook influence from many different genres like pop, rock and soul, but the sound was extremely unconventional and didn’t see much commercial success.\nThat would be the story of the band that released their second and third albums,AladdinandPeace,in 1968 and disbanded in 1974.These albums were heavily political, discussing love and calls for an end to the war in Vietnam.Peacenotably displayed a picture of a hippie-ified Santa Claus as the album cover to coincide with the Christmas release.\nA drunk executive at mail-order business Montgomery Ward once cancelled all shipments of the record after mistakenly believing a different picture of a battered and bloody Santa on the battlefield to be the album cover. Realistically, given the political messaging of the record, it was destined to fail.\nUnderstanding Rotary Connection’s history and values, it is completely apt that both Tribe and The Fugees utilised ‘Memory Band’. Both collectives are known for taking brave political stances inside and outside of their music. Quest, even as recently as 2016, reunited and released ‘We the People’ in direct opposition to Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign.\nHopefully, Rotary Connection’s influence and message will reach the limelight someday, and the members will receive their plaudits for, if nothing else, contributing to one of the most iconic hooks in hip-hop history.",

        "description": "It’s hard to talk about hip hop today without mentioningKendrick Lamar. Aside from his legendary public hanging, quartering and drawing of Drake over the last few months, his discography is unquestionably littered with all-time great tracks. From yelling “Wop wop wop wop wop” when ‘Not like us’ comes on, to telling anyone who will listen to sit down when “Humble” floats through the air waves, we’ve all been swept up in a little bit of Kendrick euphoria (there’s another one) at one stage or another. However, it might sound blasphemous to say this, given his propensity to flex his litheness with language, could it be that he is not the main draw on one of his biggest tracks?\nWhengood kid, m.A.A.d citywas released in 2012, some of the tracks became immediately recognisable as classics. ‘m.A.A.d city’ sharing its title was a good indicator that it was going to be a banger, and ‘Swimming pools’, with its transition from the infamous low frequency intro to K Dot’s fast paced flow, was a masterclass in production. Neither of these was able to compare with the track, which gained more streams on Spotify than both of those tracks combined: ‘Money Trees’.\nNot only do the lyrics speak of the harsh realities that Lamar had to facegrowing up in Compton(whatever the man was on when he cooked up “Halle Berry to Hallelujah,” we need some more of that), but the entire ensemble required to create the melodic up-and-down backing tune is closer to an orchestra than a set of DJ decks. All of these points make the track a hard one to top. Yet, the crescendo, so to speak, is only introduced at the 4:26 mark.\nSigned to Top Dawg Entertainment, just as Kendrick is, meant that Jay Rock has collaborated with the great man on a number of occasions. From ‘King’s dead’ to ‘Wow freestyle’ to ‘Hood gone love it’, the Lamar-Rock combination is a tried and tested tune maker. On ‘Money trees’, though, Jay Rock takes centre stage.\nWhere Kendrick starts slowly with a noise to set the tone, Jay Rock, when his time comes, gets stuck straight into his breathless flow. It’s as if the cadence itself sets the scene for the go go go lifestyle of a child on the streets in suburban LA. The enunciation of his “Ps” perfectly matched with the strikes of the high hats to build the tension without breaking the flow. The final two sentences of the verse hold the most value as he finally slows down the tempo in his delivery, only by a fraction, to draw extra attention to the message he’s trying to get across. Finishing with his only mention of the title of the track.\nThere is no question that Kendrick Lamar has had a more successful career than Jay Rock. The former has carried the latter to some degree, to a lot of his successes. However, for this brief stretch, the roles were reversed.",

        "title": "Behind the Mic: How Snoop Dogg made 1993 classic ‘Gin and Juice’",
        "description": "The rise of West Coast hip-hop was a slow and steady one. Beginning with Ice-T and his ‘6 In The Mornin’ track, Los Angeles took time to find itself musically. Ice-T would go highly unappreciated outside Los Angeles. Still, one thing that he did provide was hope, especially for Black Americans in South Central LA looking for a voice likeSnoop Doggwas.\nIce-T would spark a movement in LA. Following his local success, a wave of artists would drop the famous East Coast sound of electro in favour of what is now known as Gangsta rap. It reflected the realities of living as a youth in South Central LA. The movement would take off like a fully fuelled-up rocket, but was taken to new heights by NWA.\nComprised of Dr Dre, DJ Yella, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and The DOC, the Compton collective would reach heights only New York natives had seen before and became loved nationwide. Adored for their brazen lyrics, bold attitudes and anti-establishment sentiments, the crew would rule the charts between 1985 and 1990. However, after cracks started to emerge and frustrations grew, group members began to embark on their solo journeys, including the legendary Dr Dre, who would go on to create nothing short of an empire.\nIn 1991, Suge Knight and Dr Dre launched Death Row Records,where G-Funk was born and raised.One artist who would sign with Death Row in 1992 is the legendary Snoop Dogg, who released his debut album,Doggystyle,on the label to nationwide success.The second single of the legendary project was ‘Gin And Juice’, which is often considered one of the best G-funk songs of all time.\nProduced by Dre at the Death Row studios in Tarzana, ‘Gin And Juice’ was made as one of the album’s few party tracks. With Death Row mostly releasing gangster-related music, Dre thought it would be suitable for Snoop’s album to have a fun side, as he was from Long Beach. The city was a beachside party hotspot for those living in the inner-city areas of LA, and Snoop embodied its vibe.\nA feel-good single, the song lyrics were written solely by Snoop as an ode to the many parties he had attended in Long Beach, where gin and juice were served. It was considered the drink most complementary to Marijuana and, therefore, the most popular. To create the infectious beat for this song, Dre sampled the bass of the 1974 soul track, ‘I Get Lifted’ by George McRae.\nThe flow of Snoop’s lyrics for the chorus was inspired by ‘Watching You’ by Slave. The original song features the lyrics, “Walking down the street watching ladies, go by watching you.” However, this was swapped out by Dre and Snoop and replaced by the more suitable, “Rollin’ down the street, smokin’ indo, sippin’ on gin and juice.” However, the singer they used for the album version of the track was David Ruffin Jr, the son of David Ruffin, who was a member of the legendary blues group, The Temptations.\nSpeaking toVICEabout how he and Dr Dre were drinking the concoction when they made the song, Snoop explained, “Gin and juice was the choice of drink for a young playa. 1991, 1992, you didn’t really have a lot of money, you go get that gin. When it came time to make the record,Doggystyle, that was my thing: Every day I would come to the studio with my bottle of gin and juice in it, and Dre would have a big-ass milk jug full of gin and juice.”\nSnoop even revealed that his favourite gin and juice combination was Tanqueray mixed with the fruit drink Super Socco and explained how, as a teen, he would drink it out of an orange juice bottle so it would appear as orange juice to his mother.\n‘Gin And Juice’ is undoubtedly a legendary song and always will beone of the first and greatest G-funk tracksever made. The song reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the ‘Best Solo Rap Performance’ category.",

        "title": "Who invented the trap beat?",
        "description": "The evolution ofhip-hophas seen it fluctuate from the slower drum patterns of the 1970s, inspired by funk and disco, to the faster-paced product, known as trap, that we have today. We can trace specific inflexion points where there has been a shift in the purpose of the music that artists have created in the genre, spawning sub-genres along the way.\nTraditional hip hop, arising from the ghettos in the Bronx, saw artists such as Grandmaster Flash, Kool Herc, and Disco Wiz popularise the genre. As the music disseminated into the mainstream from the ghettos during the 1980s, artists such as Public Enemy, KRS-One, and Rakim ushered in the New School, which leaned towards a poetic approach with the aim of social change.\nIn the 1990s, hip hop evolved again with the birth of Gangsta Rap, pioneered by artists including NWA, Three 6 Mafia, and Dr. Dre. This strayed away from the music produced in the decade before by focusing on the harsh realities faced by those who lived in the lower socio-economic cities of America, often referring to gang-related violence.\nTrap serves as an offshoot of Gangsta Rap and tends to revolve around themes that would be foreign to listeners of the sub-genres of hip hop that came before it. The word ‘trap’ comes from the places where drugs were made and sold in Atlanta, “trap houses”. It can be characterised by its use of crisp, fast-spaced snares, 808 kick drums and high hats, which may be played in double or triple time. Since its creation, trap has spread from the Southern United States, through Latin America and into Europe and Asia, where it has been infused with other genres of those regions.\nDoctor in linguistic, literary and cultural Studies and co-author of the bookTrapalogia, Max Besora, elaborates on why he believes the genre is so successful in the modern age: “Unlike hip hop, the global success of trap music has, among others, two possible explanations: firstly, it is very much related with the development and accessibility of technology and the social networks. It could be affirmed that trap is the first musical style where people without a discography or money to pay for a demo could make music from their computers. Posting these songs/videos onto digital platforms has become a revolution with the way of making, thinking and communicating music.”\nAdding, “Meanwhile, its global success is directly related with the fact that many of the words of this type of music are generally aimed at social classes disadvantaged by the economic crisis and unemployment, independently of their place of origin. Thus, young people from all over the world, foreseeing a black future for themselves in the face of an unequal social system, feel this music like a prophecy that illustrates the path for them to follow.”\nBut who can lay a claim to have been the first to produce a trap beat? Jon I García, in the 2018 book Historia del trap, traces the beginnings of the genre empirically to the United States. Noting that it subsequently spread into Latin America and Spain from there. Atlanta rapper, TI, claimed to have created the genre in an interview with Funkmaster Flex onHot 97 FM.\nExplaining, “With the exception of Outkast, let me think, Goodie Mob… with the exception of that, before I came in the game, it was Lil Jon, Outkast, Goodie Mob, OK so you had Crunk Music and you had Organized Noise. There was no such thing as trap music, I created that, I created that. I coined the term, it was [my] second album, it dropped in 2003.”\nAdding, “After that, there was an entirely new genre of music created. An open lane for each of you to do what you do, and live your lives, on TV, and be accepted by the masses. The masses have accepted you ’cause I opened the door and you walked through it. Don’t forget who opened that door, cuz.”\nWhile listening to the album, it may resemble what we know as trap, but it does not seem to hit the mark. The title track ‘Trap musik’ may claim, through repetition, that “This is trap music”, yet it lacks any conviction other than that. ‘24s’ is full of braggadocio, and ‘Rubber band man’ fails in the same way. The album is just too jovial, too similar to the hip hop of old, to be considered trap music.\nAcross town, a producer named Shawty Redd claims to have been the originator of the genre, creating beats characterised by their sinister nature. Influenced by the music composers created for horror films, Redd, aka Demetrius Lee Stewart, contributed to the production of and wrote the title track of Gucci Mane’s 2005 album Trap House. His version of trap is much closer to what we have today.While it may be impossible to understand who the actual creator of the trap beat was, given hip hop’s propensity for evolution and mutation. It is certainly possible toappreciate what has come from those who are willing to explore the unknown. Who knows in which direction hip hop will evolve next?",

        "title": "The Story Behind The Sample: ‘DNA.’ by Kendrick Lamar",
        "description": "Kendrick Lamaris no stranger to sampling, having used the work of Bill Withers, James Brown, and Janet Jackson to enhance his own productions. In a continuation of our series on the impact that sampling has had on hip hop, we take a look at one of the standout tracks from Kendrick Lamar’sDamn.\nThe majority of this series has been dedicated to previous works which have been influential in the creation of the chosen track. This article is slightly off kilter as we will not focus on the work of a fellow musician, but rather the inclusion of a piece of criticism which has been leveraged to amplify the message.\nFollowing the success ofTo Pimp A Butterfly, Kendrick Lamar was invited to perform at the BET awards in 2015, causing some controversy when performing ‘Alright’ on top of a vandalised police car. In a segment featured on Fox News ( you can probably see where this is going), following the ceremony, which was comprised of an entirely white panel, reporters criticised his vilification of the police, with one reluctantly accepting that “That’s his right to express himself. Let the free market decide. Personally, it doesn’t excite me, it doesn’t turn me on, doesn’t interest me.. I’m not feeling it.” A second would sarcastically chime in, “A rapper who’s anti-police? That’s never happened before.” These would prove to be tame when compared with what would follow.\nGeraldo Rivera, former tabloid talk show host and attorney, with the hottest take of the night, said that “This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years.” In a twist of irony, whichFox Newsis a little too familiar with, this take fails to recognise that hip hop, to some degree, originated in a direct response to the racism experienced by the Black American community in the 1970s.\nLamar, after hearing the criticism, toldTMZ: “How can you take a song that’s about hope and turn it into hatred? The overall message is ‘We’re gonna be alright.’ It’s not the message of ‘I wanna kill people’… Hip Hop is not the problem. Our reality is the problem.”\nNever one to let those who have wronged him fail to suffer the consequences (just ask Drake), Kendrick would go on to use Riviera’s commentary in his 2017 projectDamn. In the closing section of the album opener, ‘Blood’, the introduction of the Fox News segment is used as a prelude to the second track.\nIn the ‘DNA.’ music video K-dot sets the scene with guest star Don Cheadle, acting a detective who seeks the truth from a handcuffed Lamar, dressed as his alter ego, Kung Fu Kenny. When the detective touches a lie detector, he is overcome by the spirit of the rapper he is interrogating. A rapid response is elicited from the machine, referencing all the lies that have been spat. After becoming the rapper, the detective eventually frees Kendrick from his restraints.As he walks out of the building, the infamous quote is played, which acts as a precursor to the second verse, accompanied by a beat change. With strong lyrics including “You motherfuckers can’t tell me nothin’/ I’d rather die than to listen to you” and “Sentence on the way, killings on the way”, Lamar reiterates that the tactless sound bite is a poor reading of the room when it comes to the oppression of the Black community. In the following track on the album, ‘Yah’, Kendrick directly calls out Riviera to round off his response to the comments made years before.\nFollowing the release ofDamn, Rivera posted an 18-minute video to Facebook, in which he praised Lamar for being a ‘great rapper’ before doubling down on his position, stating that hip hop has been “very culturally destructive”.\nSampling has been used in hip hop to amplify the impact of previous generations, pay homage to those who inspire, and, at times, spark creativity. By sampling the destructive statements that oppose the very source of the art in question, Kendrick Lamar proved why the existence of hip hop is still so important in the modern age.",

        "description": "The late Brooklyn emceePop Smokehad an unfathomable impact during his prime, and one of his breakout hits has defined his legacy. Whenever the song is played in a club, the place explodes, and it evokes a lot of emotion in people. ‘Dior’ was a triple-platinum single; strangely, it started on TikTok. The track was a true testament to the power of the internet and began a big wave of New York and London musicians teaming up to create music.\n808MeloBeats, who produced the club anthem, and it helped kickstart his career as a professional producer. Pop Smoke wrote the 2019 track, but the instrumental was merely a beat he had found on YouTube.UK Drill producers were making “DJ L Type Beats”and slapping them on the internet, and some of these beats were crossing the Atlantic. The ‘Dior’ beat took Pop Smoke’s fancy and, in an indirect meeting of the minds, Pop Smoke and 808Melo made a hit that millions of TikTok users made popular.\nWhether it was with dance routines or reactions, the social media excitement on Instagram and TikTok created a fervour around ‘Dior’ that has never gone away. In an interview withGenius,808Melo explained how unaware he was of ‘Dior’ when it first came out, telling the world, “So I got into the studio and I was playing the [Dior] beat. The engineer was getting gassed like, ‘Yeah, this is sick!’ But he was looking at me like ‘I’ve heard this beat before.'” After his engineer showed him Pop Smoke’s song, the beatmaker reacted, “Oh shit he ripped it off of YouTube.”\n808Melo and Pop Smoke didn’t even connect through traditional means. They didn’t meet at an industry party or have any mutual friends. Instead, Pop Smoke emailed him, and they later began speaking via Instagram. Regardless of how they joined forces, it led not only to ‘Dior’ but also to the projectMeet the Woo, which was produced entirely by 808Melo.\nThe haunted string samples used by 808Melo on the instrumental of ‘Dior’ give it an eerie feel that matches so well with Pop Smoke’s hoarse voice, it’s almost impossible to imagine anyone else on the song.The Brooklyn rhymer’sinflexions and cadence align perfectly with the haunted way the violins move on the drums, and it is undoubtedly a drill masterpiece.\nFurthermore, the Brooklyn drill was at its height in 2019, and not many of the MCs from the scene had managed to go mainstream due to their heavily gang-focused lyrics. In contrast, Pop Smoke was delivering hooks and catchy songs perfect for the charts.\n‘Dior’ ticks all of the boxes needed for a smash, which is why it defines Pop Smoke’s career. It is a strip-club hit that can also be played on the radio and has a cultural connection outside of the US, which gives it international appeal as well.",

        "title": "Behind The Mic: The true story behind Pharoahe Monch’s ‘Damage’",
        "description": "Queens emceePharaohe Monchis a powerful lyricist and tells a lot of stories with his music. From his 1999 debut,Internal Affairs,to his 2011 projectW.A.R. (We Are Renegades),he has sent a lot of messages with his lyrics. Still, one of his most impactful projects was his 2014 body of work,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nThe lead single of his 2014 project was a Lee Stone-produced track entitled ‘Damage.’ It has a dark but interesting story behind it, and, as with many Pharoahe Monch songs, it was recorded with a more profound message beyond what many listeners may hear. Its artwork depicts a bullet engraved with the writing, “Your name here,” and from the visuals alone, it is striking.\nIn a 2012 interview withThe Real Hip-Hop,Pharaoahe Monch spoke about the creation of the track, explaining, “On some straightforward hip-hop shit, I’ve had that chorus for about a year and a half. I’ve been saving it because I was looking for a hard beat to scream on rappers and utilise that ill chorus.”\nTheDesirecreator admitted that, at first, he didn’t hear it being good but then found out its place on the record once he got into the studio with Stone. TellingThe Real Hip-Hopabout this process, Monch continued, “Lee Stone hit me with this beatwhen we started working onPost Traumatic Stress Disorderand being the artist that I am, I was like, ‘Man, this is iller than I thought.’ I thought I might as well finish this trilogy and put it in the personification of the bullet and let this be the third and last instalment of the bullet records.”\nThe New York native had spoken about bullets twice before and made it a trilogy alongside his previous tracks, including ‘Stray Bullet’ and ‘When The Gun Draws’. The former was made alongside Organized Konfusion, while the latter was featured on his 2007 projectDesire.\nDuring his discussion withThe Real Hip-Hop,the emcee admitted that he wanted to bring awareness to the plague of inner-city violence and wanted to try and make the track feel as close to home as possible so listeners could personalise it and realise they could potentially fall victim to the crime too.\nTalking about how the crime inspired him to write ‘Damage’, Pharaoahe Monch detailed, “Yeah, you know it’s been so [crazy] with killing and violence here and in Detroit, Chicago, and other main cities. It’s just been crazy. I’m a passionate person, and I have empathy whenever I see that type of thing on the news, especially for young children.”\nHe added, “What I wanted to do with this song was to be as graphic as possible to bring about these types of interviews and these types of discussions to say, these bullets don’t have any heart. They aren’t sympathetic, and they don’t have empathy, whether you’re a cop or a 5-year-old.”\nThe ‘Trilogy’ rhymer also admitted he wanted to make a song that turned the table on police officers to show how indiscriminate guns are, stating, “That’s the true triple examination of the song. At the end of the day the bullet turns on the police officer. That’s how we’re going to shoot this visual and I want to examine how the song affects people when the tables are turned.”\nThe main sample Lee Stone used for the composition of ‘Damage’ was ‘When You Got Trouble’ by Redbone, and Pharoahe Monch even interpolated an LL Cool J lyric for one of his rhymes when he begins “Oh listen to the way I slay your crew.”",

        "title": "Is Kanye West still a respected musician in hip-hop?",
        "description": "Kanye Westwas one of the most powerful black musicians for over 15 years, and many would argue that he even surpassed his mentor, Jay-Z. However, in recent years, he has become a liability. Many attribute it to a mental breakdown that began when the emcee and producer was married to Kim Kardashian. Still, many see it as West showing his true colours after years of hiding.\nIrrespective of how it began, Kanye West’s relationship with hip-hop culture and fans has changed. Many cite hissupport of Donald Trump in 2016as the turning point. From there, things continued to get worse, and with each stunt, people grew increasingly frustrated at how he behaved.\nMany people in hip-hop culture, whether they’re radio hosts, podcasters, or YouTubers have their own opinions about Kanye West. But his story is unlike that of any other hip-hop artist. His Twitter outbursts and public rudeness were once shocking, seen as bizarre and out of character for someone in his position. Now, with every new rant and headline, his behaviour feels less surprising and, increasingly, less interesting.\nFurthermore, many have noted a direct correlation between his withdrawal from the music industry and the quality of his music. West’s reputation as a high-quality hip-hop musician has been severely damaged since his 2018 collaboration with Lil’ Pump (a gimmick rapper), and the track itself saw Kanye part with the idea of being a serious artist.\nAs a producer, artist, and person, Kanye is often divided into two people: “Old Kanye” and “New Kanye,” with the former’s last release beingThe Life Of Pablo.West’s 2016 endorsement of Donald Trump shocked the rap world, as nobody expected West, as a black American, to endorse a Republican candidate. Furthermore, nobody expected the rapper to venture into politics.\nWhen Kanye endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, many hated him. Still, the tide really turned after he did aTMZinterview during which he proclaimed that “slavery was a choice” and embarked on a rant about “free-thinking.” Following this, the culture steadily dismissed his words and much of his music. He then had a religious stint during which he releasedJesus Is King.\nStatistics show that this is when people stopped caring about West’s music and antics. As a musician and a celebrity, it is natural that as you age, you become less relevant, as evidenced by Jay-Z’s career. However, in 2016, it seemed that people would be interested in Kanye for years to come.\nAs a musician, many no longer respect Kanye and don’t pay attention to anything he does as he is too removed from the industry. He no longer collaborates with top-level, relevant artists due to his reputation, and, as such, he no longer has the ability to pull in listeners. Furthermore, he has no marketing team behind him,just his posts on X(formerly Twitter).\nMost people only see his name when it’s attached to a negative headline, and for many, whatever it is becomes just another Kanye story. Very few people care about what is actually in the story now. The same can be said for his music. His projects are no longer seen as exciting, groundbreaking pieces of art but simply bits of music over which he will mostly rant about things he has already spoken about online.\nThe issue of respect is complex and nuanced. However, people still appreciate Kanye West for what he provided to culture from 2004 until 2016, but beyond that, there is no respect for the current rendition of Ye and with all of his endorsements gone and his reputation in the toilet, it is unlikely we will ever see him back in the position he was once in.",

        "title": "Kid Cudi vs Scott Mescudi: the difference between the rapper and the man",
        "description": "Kid Cudihas always mentioned his birth name in his music, and there’s a distinct difference between the rapper and the man. He’s been spitting about Scott Mescudi since the early days of his career, rapping on ‘Cudi Get’, a highlight from 2008’sA Kid Named Cudimixtape, “Scott Mescudi, boy they was doubtin’ him/ Until they Googled me and found Imeem.”\nSince then, he’s continued bringing the real him into his lyrics and song titles. On his debut album,Man on the Moon: The End of Day, released in 2009, Common served as the narrator throughout the project and referred to Cudi as Scott.\nHe’s even named songs after his real name, one of them being ‘Scott Mescudi vs. the World’ fromMan on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr Rager. The track introduced his second album and featured guest vocals from Cee-Lo Green. Then, during the intro for ‘Ghost!’, which appears later on the album, he says, “My name is Scott Mescudi.”\nOn his next album, 2013’sIndicud, he kept up the intro tradition by naming the first song ‘The Resurrection of Scott Mescudi’, using an audio sample of Macauley Culkin as a psychotic school child from the 1993 filmThe Good Son.\nBut what is the difference between Kid Cudi and Scott Mescudi? On the morning of September 15th, 2009, the release date for his debut album, the Cleveland rapper explained toDJBoothhow he views the two different personas.\n“Well, Scott Mescudi seems to be alive the most in his music, and Kid Cudi is what I am 24/7, when people see me on the street, when I’m in the studio, creating, what I am when I’m on magazine covers—that’s Kid Cudi,” he said.\nContinuing, “And Scott Mescudi, the normal dude from Shaker Heights, Ohio, is only present when my songs are on, when I’m recording. Like, when my voice is bein’ laid down on those records, that’s Scott Mescudi shinin’ through.”\nHe added, “So I would definitely say that Kid Cudi and Scott Mescudi are one and the same, however, Scott Mescudi is only ever really in the light when you’re listenin’ to his songs.\nWhen asked how he wanted Kid Cudi to be viewed, he admitted he was imperfect and wanted to help people find their purpose. “I want people to just look at me as that big brother or little brother in their family, that just is tryin’ to become a man and figurin’ things out in life, when the fuzzy things happen, and things get the most confusing,” he explained.\nConcluding, “I want myfans and criticsto look at me as their little or big brother, and that’s all, man. And to understand me, and embrace that fact that I know I’m not perfect, and I’m puttin’ it out there in my music so other people can learn from it and learn from my ignorance, too.” All these years later, Cudi is still inspiring his fans, most recently with 2024’sInsano (Nitro Mega)album.",

        "title": "Top 5: Five songs you didn’t know rappers wrote for other artists",
        "description": "Ghostwriting has always been taboo in hip-hop. There’s always been a belief that rappers should write their own lyrics and that any assistance in the process is damaging to their ability as an MC. Despite that, some of the best songs in the genre have been the product of musicians coming together to craft something special.\nOne of thebiggest examples is Kanye West, who tends to include a lot of people in his songwriting credits. On the other hand, Drake has been criticised for using ghostwriters in the past. Famously, Quentin Miller wrote reference tracks that have gone on to become big songs for the Toronto rapper.\nStill, the act of writing for others hasn’t always been frowned upon. Artists like Dr Dre, who is one of the biggest artists of all time, has been open about others writing for him.\nBelow, check out five songs you might not know were written by other rappers in the industry.\n‘Still D.R.E.’ might be one of Dr Dre’s biggest songs, butJay-Z actually wrote it. Hov served as a ghostwriter for Dre and Snoop’s hit from the2001album, which was originally about diamonds and Bentleys. Dre then requested something more relatable; within 20 minutes, Jay returned with something a bit more West Coast.\n“On that reference track, I’m doing Dre and Snoop’s vocals,” Jay-Z said on HBO’sThe Shop. “The reference track, it sounds like them. The Foxy [Brown] reference I’m glad nobody can find that one. But you gotta have somewhat a reverence for them. Obviously, the music they were making withThe Chronicand all that.\n“In order for me to really nail the essence of Dre and Snoop had to be like a studied reverence of what they were doing. Even to put myself in their shoes. ‘Cause think about that record. That record comes after Dre leaves Death Row. ‘How? My last album wasThe Chronic.’”\nKanye Westhas had his issues with Drakeover the years but he’s always complimented his writing skills. Although Ye came up with the initial ideas for ’30 Hours’, taken from hisThe Life of Pabloalbum, it was Drizzy who actually turned it into lyrics.\n“I’ll be having like 12 writers in the studio that don’t add up to Drake,” Kanye said onDrink Champs. “That’s why I was interested when he heard ’30 Hours’ because Drake wrote that for me. I’m like, ‘Boom, here, I got this many ideas,’ like the line I had, ‘I remember being nervous to do Victoria’s Secret ’til I pictured everybody with they clothes off.’\n“You could be nervous to do like a speech and they say, ‘Picture everybody naked,’ so we flipped it like, ‘I was nervous to do Victoria’s Secret ’til I pictured everybody naked.’ And I sent it to Drake, and Drake took it and barred it out and wrote the whole rap. You understand how much easier my life would be if Drake would just write my raps for me? I’m sure everyone wished they had that luxury.”\nFormer G.O.O.D. Music signee CyHi the Prynce was one of the many artists who helped write Travis Scott’s ‘Sicko Mode‘, which apparently damaged his relationship with Kanye West due to Drake dissing him on the track. CyHi has defended the act of writing for others, claiming he’s just there to help.\n“When people say, ‘Are you a ghostwriter?’ – it’s not like I’m writing a song for someone who doesn’t know how to do it themselves,” he toldHipHopDX. “They’re telling you like, ‘Yo, I wanna say this, I want the cadence to go like this, I wanna do this.’\n“And in Travis’ defence, he had just had mouth surgery that day. So we were actually there kind of writing it together and I would just lay it for him so he could hear it.”\nPost Malone landed one of thebiggest singles of his careerin 2017 with ‘Congratulations’ from hisStoneyalbum. A little known fact is that Joey Bada$$ actually wrote the song, which peaked at number eight on the Hot 100 and went 14 times platinum.\nT-Pain once claimed that the track’s original version featured himself and Joey, with the Brooklyn rapper revealing he was telling the truth. “This is facts,” he wrote on Twitter (now known as X). “I actually co-wrote the song w post 🙂 quietly got my first #1 off that. More ghostwriting in 2018.”\nDespite his lack of songwriting credit, the Pro Era rapper appeared to be paid for his work on the record.\nSZA may be a superstar in 2025, but she wrote music for other artists over a decade ago. Case in point: Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé’s ‘Feeling Myself’ from 2014’sThe Pinkprintalbum. The TDE singer helped put together the song alongside producer Hit-Boy.\n“I wrote parts of that,” she toldSway’s Universe. “A nice chunk of that [laughs]. I’m on the credits, so I think it’s really interesting. It was dope meeting Beyoncé. She’s tight. She’s perfect actually. Literally, like on God, it was something I could never explain to anyone. The call just got put in and then I arrived [laughs], I have no idea.\n“Hit-Boy produced and I wrote the lyrics, so Nicki and Beyoncé are singing some of the things that I wrote to it. But [Hit-Boy] and I just work really well together, like we vibe together just because he’s such a cool kid. He’s not pretentious at all, for as accomplished as he is he’s just super welcoming and drinks like chocolate milk all day, honestly the nicest kid.”",

        "title": "Top 5: The five greatest opening songs on hip-hop albums",
        "description": "Although there have been several debates over the years among older generations within thehip-hopindustry about whether or not the album format has become redundant, it is evident that for most, it most definitely is not. Last year saw some quality albums, and whether it’s Tyler The Creator’sChromakopiaor ScHoolboy Q’sBlue Lips,some of the material was undeniably good. Although there were some fantastic mixtapes, several of the albums set themselves apart with their excellence.\nOf course, what is a ‘good album’ andwhat is a ‘bad album’ is subjective, and opinions can differ. However, there are some common threads that all music fans agree on when it comes to making that decision. When listening to albums, there are specific criteria the body of work just has to meet. A good album is thematically and sonically cohesive. Cohesion is an essential trait of all good albums.\nNow, while it is seen as poor ifall the instrumental trackssound the same, they should seamlessly come together and subtly weave into one another. Jumping between genres and having one song abruptly end and another begins with the two sounding different is quite jarring and often uncomfortable for listeners. Another thing people look for is substance. An underlying story, subtle undertones, or a consistent theme. An album that one minute is lyrically telling you one thing but then in the next track contradicts itself is, again, quite jarring and highly confusing for listeners.\nAn album’s intro or opening track immediately sets the tone and could be considered one of the most essential songs of a project. The first track can give listeners a sense of where the body of work is set to go, sonically, and often signals the quality of an album. That said, we have compileda list of the five bestopening tracks from hip-hop albums.\nAlthough this track is more modern and is a far cry from some of the great intros of 1990s rap, it’s fair to say that the dramatic feeling created by the sample of Phil Manzanera’s ‘K-Scope’ sets up the listener for what was the last great collaborative project fromJay-Zand Kanye West.\nWith outstanding vocals from the elusive Frank Ocean, a song like this will never be produced again. Kanye West, 88-Keys and Mike Dean all brought something to the table, and in turns of lyricism, Jay-Z most certainly provided tension. As an opening song forWatch The Throne,it’s safe to say it is one of the best intros ever.\nAside from the fact thatThe Infamousis an East Coast classic, its opening track is a perfect example of the kind of music the project boasts. With a simple but catchy piano melody from ‘Lovers Chant’ by Dee Dee Warwick, it showcases how a straightforward piano riff can be the backbone of a song.\nThe soft opening offsets some of the harsher-sounding songs on the album, providing a fantastic balance that otherwise wouldn’t have been achieved. This introduction toMobb Deep‘sThe Infamousis not just one track on an album but epitomises the sound of New York during the mid-to-late 1990s. As such, it is arguably one of the best openings to an album ever.\n‘Can’t Knock The Hustle’ was one of the firstJay-Zsongs to hit the charts and, as the intro of his debut projectReasonable Doubt,it was his chance to make an excellent first impression, and that he did. The track was not a commercial smash but landed at number seven on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs Chart, and, in retrospect, many hip-hop fans consider it a classic.\nThe smooth instrumental and incredible verses from the Brooklyn legend perfectly set the stage for tracks such as ‘Dead Presidents II’ and ‘Regrets’, which followed a similar pattern yet all sounded unique. ‘Can’t Knock The Hustle’ is a fantastic opening track due to its simplicity, epitomising the project as a whole.\nThe opening track toSnoop Dogg‘s 1993 classicDoggystyleis very similar to many of the intros from the Death Row label in the early 1990s. With a P-funk sample from Funkadelic’s 1979 classic ‘(Not Just) Knee Deep’, it hears a mixture of talking and rapping with verses from Dr Dre and Lady Of Rage.\nThe overblown P-funk bass heard in the intro is a sound that is used throughout the album, and George Clinton’s voice on the intro shows recognition from the Funkadelic frontman of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, who themselves sampled his music heavily for their revolutionary tracks. The project seamlessly saw Dr Dre’s production evolve from a softer, more traditional funk sample-based sonic to a more aggressive style with the increased use of George Clinton. The intro ofDoggystyleis arguably one of the best of all time.\nThe Chronicis one of the best hip-hop albums of all time—period. From its production to its guest verses, it marked a shift in rap music and the start of a new era in the culture. AlthoughDr Dre‘s production was an extension of what he did for NWA,The Chronicwas a cohesive showcase of what became known as G-funk. It’s fair to say it was the dominant sound of the 1990s.\nThe Chronic’sintro not only sounds good, with appearances from Snoop Dogg, but it also perfectly encapsulates what follows it. The project’s intro is the epitome of G-funk. With a prominent sample from George Clinton’s Parliament, it truly embodied the spirit of what came out of Death Row Records in the following years.",

        "title": "Top 5: The five best songs from the St Louis rap scene",
        "description": "St Louis has always been an outlier in terms of hip-hop. Akin to other cities in middle America like Kansas City and Louisville, although it has a large Black American population, it hasn’t produced a fantastic number of rappers. Although St Louis has produced a range of MCs, it hasn’t been well-represented in the musical landscape sincehip-hop‘s inception.\nUnlike cities such as Atlanta, New York, and Los Angeles, St. Louis’ population isn’t expansive enough for it to have a large and thriving music scene. As such, it hasn’t really developed its own sound. The city has always tapped into different sounds from across the US and managed to find its place. Still, concerning rap music, unlike the country’s bigger cities, A&Rs aren’t paying much attention to the St. Louis scene.\nAs such, historically, it has taken a lot for an aspiring emcee to make it out of St Louis as a successful rapper, but it has happened on several occasions, and although not all of the city’s rhymers have had long-lasting careers, they have certainly had an impact on hip-hop culture. Some of them even charted globally.\nIn contemporary hip-hop, the single most recognisable emcee from St Louis is Sexyy Red. Although, at the moment, it is unclear how long or illustrious her career will be, she is (for now) the most relevant. Still, there is little representation, but we have compileda list of the top five rap songsto come out of St Louis.\nThe late Huey was a St. Louis rapper who, like many MCs, found his route to fame by having one of his songs featured on a mixtape. Huey appeared on a series of mixtapes, one of which was the popular 2000s mixtape seriesUnsigned Hype. As such, his talent caught the attention of one particular producer who not only got him a record deal but also produced his one and only hit, ‘Pop, Lock & Drop It’.\nDuring this mid-2000s era, acts such as Soulja Boy and Lil Mama were finding success in making songs with accompanying dance routines, and Huey saw the same with this formula. ‘Pop, Lock & Drop It’ became extremely popular with the youth and began to enter the Black American vernacular. It saw a boost of success when a remix was made in 2007 featuring Bow Wow and T-Pain.\nChingy was a St Louis native who caught the attention of Ludacris in the early 2000s after rising to fame alongside Nelly. Chingy was a member of the St Lunatics, a St Louis-based rap collective that appeared heavily on Nelly’s debut project,Country Grammar, and partially on his sophomore album,Nellyville. Due to the exposure Nelly gave him, Chingy managed to sign a record deal with Ludacris’ Disturbing Tha Peace label in 2002 and quickly brought out a body of work based on the prominent sound of the South.\nIn 2003, he deliveredJackpot, with his debut single being the iconic ‘Right Thurr’. With the money and marketing now at his disposal, Chingy was able to enter the mainstream, and his lead single hit the Billboard Hot 100 at number two, where it remained for five weeks. It is most definitely one of the biggest hip-hop songs from St Louis and will remain so for the foreseeable future.\nJ-Kwon is widely considered a one-hit wonder, and there are many theories as to why he fell off so quickly in his career. In 2018, during an interview with BET, the emcee unveiled that the reason he disappeared after his 2004 debut,Hood Hop, was that Arista Records shut down. Following this, he was transferred to Jive Records, where they didn’t know how to market his music.\nStill, his 2004 track ‘Tipsy’ was a smash hit. The beat for the song is iconic, and it is known the world over as a classic 2000s hip-hop track. Produced by the St. Louis production team Trackboyz, it seemed to come out of nowhere and shot to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the blink of an eye and brought a lot of eyes to the city and its talent. To this day, it is popular and still brings back memories for many rap fans.\nNelly is one of St Louis’ biggest and most successful exports concerning rap music. As the frontman of the St Louis-based collective St. Lunatics, Nelly was a highly visible figure in his city, and the renowned DJ Kut would heavily play the group on the radio. Nelly’s talent was too much to contain, and before long, record labels were beginning to notice the traction he had across the Midwest and more widely.\nIn the early-2000s, one ofNelly’s biggest hits was ‘Air Force Ones’, which featured on his seven-times platinum sophomore album,Nellyville. The song was released as the third single after ‘Hot In Herre’ and ‘Dilemma’ and debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.\nNelly is by far the most successful rappers to ever come out of St Louis. He is a renowned name in hip-hop and will always be known as one of the kingpins of 2000s rap music. He was truly one of the first artists from his city to crossover into the mainstream and achieve vast amounts of success. Moreover he put the city on the map in many ways.\n‘Hot In Herre’ is one of Nelly’s biggest tracks and is undoubtedly his most popular track ever. Released as the lead single of his groundbreaking albumNellyville,the Neptunes-produced songhas been played on the radio and spun in clubs for over twenty years. ‘Hot In Herre’ debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since become a double-platinum hit known to every hip-hop fan.",

        "title": "Top 5: The five best Atlanta rappers of all time",
        "description": "Since the emergence of crunk and the electronification of hip-hop that accompanied it, more and more people have begun looking to the South for their hip-hop. It is indisputable that sampling became less common in rap music during the mid-2000s, and artists such asKanye Westhelped cement this reality with albums likeGraduationand808s & Heartbreak.\nAlthough Kanye’s 2008 album boosted the popularity of the 808 bass kick, producers in the South had been using them for years with their more digital production. When Kanye released808s & Heartbreak, the sound became much more prevalent in hip-hop. By the year 2012, when an offshoot of crunk music known as trap came out of Atlanta, the South began to hold the torch for hip-hop, and it has been holding it ever since.\nTo this day, trap is the sound of hip-hop,with people not even considering it trap music, merely hip-hop; because it is so present in the mainstream, it has overshadowed and obliterated other forms of hip-hop. Atlanta holds the torch for rap music and has, arguably, since the early 2010s, when artists such as Gucci Mane and Jeezy peaked in popularity.\nHowever, labels such as Quality Control and 1017 Records have birthed stars such asYoung Thug, the Migos and Lil Baby.That said, Atlanta has become a breeding ground for new talent, but some of the city’s older stars are still powerful and highly respected. As such, below, we have compiled a list of the five most essential and impactful Atlanta MCs of all time.\nGucci Maneis an Atlanta legend and although he has become an easily dislikeable figure over the years he has helped a to of local talent. From the Migos to Young Thug, Waka Flocka Flame and others his label 1017 Records is only second to Quality Control as the most powerful label in Atlanta.\nGucci Mane is one of Atlanta’s most pioneering MCs. As one of the first trap artists of all time, he made a massive impact on hip-hop and was among a handful of artists who put Atlanta on the map. With critically acclaimed albums such asTrap House,Hard To Kill,Trap-A-ThonandBack to the Trap House, he laid a blueprint for young Southern artists who now dominate the hip-hop culture.\nYoung Thugwas just released from jail but despite the lengthy trial he still remains one of Atlanta’s most beloved MCs. Although his style could be compared to Future’s or other prominent Atlanta rappers, his style and energy is undeniably attractive. From Drake to Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj and more Young Thug has collaborated with the best of the best.\nHis career took off when he signed with fellow Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane’s 1017 Records and he began to see a wave of support for his music after a few years when he released tracks such as ‘Stoner’ and ‘Danny Glover’. Young Thug has made a huge impact on hip-hop and despite his arguably simple style it has proved successful.\nThe Migoschanged hip-hop in the eyes of many and for some it was an exciting development and for others it was a regression. However, hether you love the Migos or hate them, it’s fair to say they made some lasting changes with regard to the kind of rap people consume.\nThe trio who rose on the Quality Control label in the 2010s quickly took over hip-hop and became the faces of the genre for the decade. It is argued that it was the Migos that popularised the triplet flow and their ingenious use of it for hooks became a practice that is now regarded as common practice. It is now the de facto sound of rap music and although their music isn’t to everybody’s taste, commercially, they were a phenomenon who created classic Southern club music.\nFutureis one of the most respected MCs in Atlanta, and his contribution to hip-hop has been mammoth. Since the early 2010s and even the late-2000s, he has put out hits that have swept the charts. Songs such as ‘Mask Off’ remain club anthems to this day, and despite him often being labelled as a “mumble rapper” and a promoter of drug abuse, he has remained one of the most pivotal MCs in rap music.\n‘Mask Off’ was a song that went nine times platinum. Due to his prevalence in the mainstream over the years, Future has been described as one of the most influential rappers of his generation. Many MCs have attempted to mimic his sound and style. Alongside figures such as Drake, Future is often considered one of the main pioneers of contemporary, melody-driven hip-hop.\nAndré 3000is undeniably the most impactful artist to come out of Atlanta. From the quality of the music he has released over the years to his creativity, as part of Outkast, he delivered some of hip-hop’s most beloved tracks and albums.Speakerboxx/The Love BelowsurpassedThe Eminem Showin 2023, becoming the highest-selling hip-hop project of all time, and his versatility is unparalleled.\nFromATLienstoStankoniathe Outkast discography is untouchable, and only figures such as Kanye West and Dr Dre have managed to build such a flawless catalogue of music. Songs such as ‘Ms Jackson’ are timeless and André 3000 inspired an entire generation of creatives to embrace difference and become more experimental in their approach to rap music.",

        "title": "Questlove reveals his favourite albums of the 1980s",
        "description": "Philadelphia rapper and former member of The Roots collectiveQuestloveis a hip-hop icon and has made massive contributions to the culture over the years. As a producer, DJ and film director, the musician is a highly sought-after creative and true creative.\nQuestlove’s primary attraction is his production ability and extremely conscious art, with which he partners a very soulful and jazz-inspired type of sonic. The producer is also a known journalist and somewhat of a music historian.\nThat said, he has a broad range of tastes, and even during the 1980s, as he wasgearing up to form The Roots with Black Thought,Questlove was listening to a range of genres, and some of them weren’t even close to the kind of music he ended up making. During interviews, many rappers reveal that during the ‘80s, they were listening to artists such as Grandmaster Flash, Sugar Hill Gang and the Funky Four Plus One — some of the earliest hip-hop groups of the era.\nStill, as an instrumentalist and general music-lover, he appreciated more than just the trendy genre of the day. He didn’t focus purely on hip-hop but listened to everything from soul to funk and rock. However, he did listen to some hip-hop and even the rap he listened to wasn’t the soul-oriented style he producedwhen The Roots took off.Below is a list of Questlove’s most cherished albums from each year of the 1980s and his personal words on why they are so exceptional.\nDiana Ross is renowned for her soulful voice and was known as the ‘Queen of Motown’ during the 1960s. As the lead vocalist of The Supremes, she was a bright star, and the beginning of her solo career in 1970 saw her begin a long journey to superstardom.\nThat said, Questlove became fascinated with her talents and in 1980, when the vocalist released her eleventh album,Diana, he was encapsulated by it. As such, to him, it is still the best album of that year.\nExplaining how he first fell in love with the project, the Philly native toldVulture,“I spent the entire summer of 1980 living in a vacation resort called Frenchman’s Reef in the Virgin Islands. The Diana record was the only contemporary record that I heard because the owner of the nightclub where my parents were playing had it on continuously as filler music between my father’s shows.” But he doesn’t consider it filler music and loves it, even now.\nThe Time were a funk and rock band from Minneapolis that really had an effect on Questlove. Speaking about how enthralled he was when he first heard their 1981 song ‘After Hi School,’ the producer once revealed, “There was a kid in sixth grade whose mom allowed him to bring his boom box to the cafeteria. When “After Hi School” came on, I tripped over the cord and knocked his boom box over. I was blown away!”\nThe Timewas the collective’s self-entitled debut, but as a Minneapolis-based group, they had a lot of music with Prince, who even sang background vocals on some of their songs and produced the collective’s third album,Ice Cream Castle,in its entirety.\nThe iconic Prince was a behemoth of an artist and is still considered one of the best musicians of all time. Along with Michael Jackson, he completely shook up mainstream music worldwide and was effectively beloved by everyone, no matter their taste.\n1999was the legend’s fifth album but his first to ever enter the Top 10 of the Billboard 200. Although the project was out of this world, and Questlove wanted to play it loud, he once revealed he had to hide from his parents to hear ‘Lasy Cab Driver’, admitting, “One Saturday, the radio was on, and I realized they were about to play the sexy part in ‘Lady Cab Driver,’ so I ran to the kitchen and shattered a bowl. When I got back, Prince was on to the guitar solo!”\nSynchronicitywas the last album The Police ever released, and it topped the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums chart. With songs such as ‘Every Breath You Take’ and ‘King Of Pain’, it is a far cry from hip-hop, yet it was his father’s disapproval of the song ‘Mother’ that made him take an interest in the project, which he then loved.\nQuestlove was often brought on tour with his father, the lead singer of Lee Andrews & the Hearts. Recalling his introduction to The Police, he once unveiled, “One day, we were driving to a bar gig. We had two vans. The family was in van one, and the band was in van two. When we pulled up alongside each other, ‘Mother’ was playing. ‘Turn that devil shit off in front of my son’, my father said. I was 12, so whatever was a no was an instant yes.”\nThe Glamorous Lifewas Questlove’s favourite album of 1984, and he had it on cassette for about six months. But according to a story told by the genius himself, his strict religious parents banned Sheila E in his house due to one line from ‘Oliver’s Party’.\nRecalling how much he begged to getThe Glamorous Life,Questlove explained, “I convinced my parents that even though Sheila E. sounded like Prince, she had nothing to do with him. But there’s a line from “Oliver’s Party” where she says, ‘She got drunk and called me a bitch just cuz I kissed him,’ and that was that. Goodbye, Sheila E.”\nQuestlove had a love for funk music in his youth, as many hip-hop artists did, and one guitarist he really enjoyed was Jesse Johnson. Still, theThings Fall Apartmusician admitted that when Prince left his original sound behind, he gravitated toward the solo work of his guitarist Jesse Johnson.\nRemembering how he discoveredJesse Johnson’s Revue,the Philly creative explained, “Prince wanted to beat the Beatles at their own game.Around the World in a Daywas his bid. I dug it. I loved it. But I also missed the straight, stripped-down Minneapolis funk, and that’s why I gravitated toward Jesse Johnson’s first record.”\nQuestlove has worked with Janet Jackson before and has even been her DJ on three occasions. That said, he fell in love with Control, and for him, it is without fail the album he listened to the most in 1986.\nWhen he interacted with Jackson, he once put on the song ‘He Doesn’t Know I’m Alive’ as it was one of the only songs from the project that didn’t blow up, and he wanted to show his love for the whole project. Recalling the event, Questlove once revealed, “I DJ’d for Janet three times, and she just shit when I put on ‘He Doesn’t Know I’m Alive,’ which is one of the few songs from that record that didn’t become a hit. I wanted to show her that she was important to me!”\nQuestlove first heard this 1987 album in a Philadelphia laundromat and loved one of the songs so much that he taped over one of his cassettes to record it off the radio. A common practice back in the old days.\nDetailing the story, theOrganixcreator toldVulture,“When I first heard ‘Housequake’, I was at a local laundromat, and when the song came on, with the Camille voice saying, ‘Shut up already … damn!’, I just freaked out. I ran right home to get my hands on a cassette player so I could tape it. I made it in time for Prince to say, ‘A groove this funky is on the run.’”\nPublic Enemy is widely considered one of the most overtly political hip-hop groups ever. The collective was the precursor to political commentators such as 2Pac, and the New York group encouraged many artists to infuse a raw critique of society in their music and this was a big deal for Questlove.\nIn fact, the track ‘Show ‘Em Whatcha Got’ influenced him to leave his fast-food job and chase his dreams. Recalling how the album emboldened him, the emcee reflected, “I bought this cassette before I went to work. I wasn’t allowed to have my Walkman on when I cooked fries, so I kept sneaking to the freezer to hear “Show ’Em Whatcha Got.” It enlarged me. “I’m going on lunch break,” I said, but I knew I was never going back.”\nThe Beastie Boys were one of just many trios coming out of New York in the 1980s. Comprised of Mike D, MCA and Ad-Rock, the collective, akin to Run-DMC, were an act embracing the many parallels between rock and rap music, and it was a sound that couldn’t be stopped during the decade.\nThat said, Questlove was a huge fan and loved the genre-fusing sonic of the Beastie Boys. In fact, it was what inspired him to make music. Speaking about its influence on him, the instrumentalist once recalled, “Here was an album making art of my dad’s soft rock and yacht rock and my sister’s mainstream junior-high-school rock albums. It’s when I realized I wanted to make records.”",

        "title": "Five J Cole songs that confirmed him as a lyrical genius",
        "description": "Even from his early days of rapping over beats from Jay-Z, Nas and Kanye West, it was clearJ Colehad something special about him. Through his early mixtapes such asThe Come UpandThe Warm Upto studio albums2014 Forest Hills Driveand4 Your Eyez Only, Cole has always shown maturity far older than his age.\nThe storytelling tracks showcase Cole at his best, whether he raps from the perspective of a pregnant woman or speaks to the daughter of a friend who’s passed away. What makes it even more impressive is that he largely produces his music on his own.\nCole has alreadycemented his name in hip-hop history, but we can only hope that he continues to release music of a high calibre far beyond the long-awaitedThe Fall Off.\nBelow, take a listen to five songs that confirmed J Cole as a lyrical genius.\nJ Cole showed signs of excellence as a rookie in his debut mixtape,The Come Up, in 2007. Aside from rapping over a few known beats, Cole produced most of the project himself, with ‘Can’t Cry’ one of the standout moments.\nOn the track, he touches on police brutality over a soulful beat sampling Millie Jackson. He raps, “Plus the cops harassing us/ Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim/ Reporters sympathising like they truly know the pain/ They killed her only son/ Now she wanna blow her brains out/ Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit.”\nFriday Night Lightshighlight ‘Premeditated Murder’ finds J Cole rapping about his life-changing after signing a deal with with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation. The lyrics question whether his personality is switching up along with the money and fame while having no choice but to adapt to his new lifestyle.\nCole raps, “You see I promised that I’d never change/ But that was way before I made the dough and met the game/ Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow/ And even white women want a n-gga, Othello.”\nJ Cole once called ‘Lost Ones’ one of his favourite songs due to the emotional nature of the record. The lyrics tell the story of a young girl becoming pregnant, with his verses being told from the perspective of the man, the woman and someone completely neutral.\nThe idea for the song came to Cole through a situation going on with a close friend at the time, resulting in one of the best moments on his debut albumCole World: The Sideline Storyin 2011.\nSpeak to any J Cole fan, and they’ll tell you just how much ‘Love Yourz’ means to them. Taken from 2014 Forest Hills Drive, a contender for Cole’s best album, the song finds the North Carolina rapper reflecting on how far he’s come, explaining how love and happiness trump material things.\nHe raps on the song, “It’s beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success/ Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress/ I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less/ Compared to some my n-ggas down the block, man, we were blessed.”\nOn ‘4 Your Eyez Only’, the title track from his 2016 album, Cole speaks to his late friend James McMillian, Jr’s newborn daughter. The first three verses see Cole rapping from the perspective of his friend, who died at the age of 22, with the final verse coming from his own point of view.\nIt’s Cole at his storytelling best, telling the little girl just how much her father loved her in the form of a tribute that will live on forever.",

        "title": "The albums Sen Dog thinks every hip-hop fan has to hear",
        "description": "Sen Dog is widely known as a member of the madly influential hip-hop group, and passionate weed advocates;Cypress Hill. Whether or not you have heard of Sen or even the group itself, you’ve heard their songs. They’re credited with their foundational efforts of bringing hip-hop into the mainstream, efforts that were recognised in 2019 as they became the first rap group to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nBorn Senen Reyes in Cuba, the rapper eventually settled in Oakland, California. The city was notorious for gang violence during his early years and sure enough, Reyes fell victim to the allures of the lifestyle. As a member of the Bloods gang set Neighbourhood Family, he eventually brought his Cousin and eventual member of Cypress Hill, B-Real, into the fold.\nThis was a costly decision as Real’s time in the gang saw him on the receiving end of a bullet to the lungs.Luckily, he survived, and the cousins decided to turn their life around and attribute more time to the group they had formed with Reyes’ brother Mellow Man Ace and DJ Muggs, which wasoriginally named DVX (Devastating Vocal Explosion).\nThe group lost Ace to a solo career but persevered regardless, releasing their self-titled album in 1991 which did very well, peaking at number 31 on theBillboard200. The best was yet to come though as in 1993 they releasedBlack Sundaywhich debuted at number 1 on the 200.\nBlack Sundaybent genre lines which was a huge factor behind its success. Tracks like ‘Insane in the Brain’ and ‘Hits from the Bong’ have stood the test of time, and continue to be used as a cultural identifier of hip-hop and the ‘90s as a whole.\nSen spoke withConsequencein 2023 who took the opportunity to pick his brain about the 10 albums he believes every hip-hop fan had to hear. He provided an inspired list of classic after classic; a rotation that is the true makings of every hip-hop-head’s wet dream. Finding his success in the genre as a member of a group, it’s no surprise that Reyes’s list is group-heavy.\nHe gushes about these records, it’s clear that he’s extremely passionate about his choices. Talking about Ultramagnetic MCs’ 1988 albumCritical Beatdownhe recalled “there was one of those records that we would listen to front to back”. The album itself never saw much commercial success but is critically enjoyed, Dog knows ‘em when he hears ‘em.\nHe also goes on to talk so romantically about Run DMC’sKing of Rock. The duo’s rock-rap fusion was a signifier of their intent to revolutionise the game. It clearly served as a source of inspiration for the California native whose own music is known to blur those very lines.\nSpeaking about his experience with the album he said “the first time I heard Run-DMC was life changing, because that was the first band that I saw that made me want to do what they were doing”.\nHis passion for the albums is palpable; it jumps through the screen, and it’s difficult to make any changes to his list, so we recommend you listen to them for yourselves using our list below.",

        "title": "Five Nas songs you need to hear before you die",
        "description": "Nasis one of the most celebrated lyricists in hip-hop and, at one point, ruled New York. Known for his infamous battle with Jay-Z and Roc-A-Fella records, Nas is definitely a rapper that will go down in history. However, unlike the big man Hov, Nas’ career never took off the way it was supposed to in the early noughties. With so many notable rappers coming onto the scene at the turn of the millennium, Nas seemed to stall and is still predominantly considered a 1990s rapper. However, he still released some quality records after the ’90s.\nBorn and raised in the Queensbridge area of New York,Nas was one of the biggest names in underground hip-hop during the early ’90s,with his debut album Illmatic to this day still classed as a classic and a must-listen for any hip-hop fan. He was a rapper, songwriter and, most importantly, a storyteller that other artists envied over. The rapper’s ability to immerse listeners in a story was second to none, and his way with words was awe-inspiring. His music remains one of hip-hop’s most memorable creations, and his cultural contribution can never be negated.\nWhat’s fascinating about Nas is his ability to romanticise what can often be very sombre themes and find the beauty in what most would consider squalor. Listening to a Nas album is an unparalleled experience. Beyond the braggadocious attitudes and materialism that are so often associated with the hip-hop genre, you have a soul, and Nas’ albums were straight from the soul. They can evoke a range of emotions, and that’s crucial in hip-hop; a quality album cannot be centred around pure anger.\nAlongside Hit-Boy, Nas has made a huge comeback recently and has successfully proved that he is still a force to be reckoned with. Since 2020, the lyricist has releasedKing’s Disease,King’s Disease II,King’s Disease III,MagicandMagic 2. In 2020,the emcee received his first-ever Grammy Awardand has been on a roll ever since. That said, five essential Nas songs need to be heard if you are to understand his excellence as an artist.\n‘Ether’ by Nas is not only the most well-known diss track in hip hop but almost the most well-made. Aimed at Jay-Z, ‘Ether’ epitomises the perfect diss track. It is clear with the first three words being “F*ck Jay-Z”, so there is no ambiguity surrounding who the song is aimed at. It addresses Jay-Z’s come-up and dissects how he may have ridden the coattails of others to achieve his success.\nIt is also an underdog story. Nas was not as relevant as Jay-Z at the time, so most assumed he would never respond to Jay-Z’s diss track ‘The Takeover’. However, he did and was disrespectful but also comedic in reminding listeners that in Jay-Z’s first-ever music video appearance, he wore a Hawaiian shirt, which ultimately undermined Hova’s gangster image and was highly comical.\nNas’ successful early noughties tracks were few and far between, however, ‘I Can’ was a song that performed extremely well for Nas’ in 2002. Unlike theIllmaticdays, in 2002 Eminem was now the go-to for lyricism so Nas had to try a new approach.\nIn an interview withRolling Stone,Nas, explaining the song’s importance, proclaimed, “that was my biggest radio record I ever had.” With regard to the song’s somewhat childish feel, Nas recalled how he had just become a father around that time and admitted that it affected his music as he stated, “I owed her and other kids something, something real, something real that’s up their alley, to show that I cared, that I’m a human being, that I’m not just about giving you a tune about what happens in the hood and all that every day.”\nNas’ sophomore album was sonically different from his debut and saw a refinement in the overall production, including cleaner, more melodic beats. Although this was a shift, Nas’ lyrics remained heartfelt and passionate, and ‘The Message’ is an example of how the Queensbridge icon attacked emotional instrumentals onIt Was Written.\nWith its acoustic guitar riff and understated bass, the Trackmasters-produced hit puts Nas front and centre, and his ferocity is undeniable. In the song, Nas details a story about a shooting that sends chills down listeners’ spines. As he raps, “You owe me, cousin. Somethin’ told me, ‘Plug him!’ / So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb / Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son,” it evokes a fear that even the bravest would feel.\nThis Pete Rock-produced single is a combination of uplifting yet realistic lyrics. The smooth piano rift comes courtesy of a sample of Ahmad Jamal’s ‘I Love Music’ and gives the track a laidback and relaxed, jazzy feel. On the song, Nas tells listeners, “The world is yours!” and during his verses, the Queensbridge native gets spiritual, rhyming, “There’s no days for broke days when sellin’ smoke pays / While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin’ they sins in trays of holy water” and “Thinkin’ a word best describin’ my life to name my daughter / My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection.”\nIn an interview withOkayPlayer,Pete Rock explained that the song was a call out to New York and Black America, sharing, “It’s endured as it captures the feel of New York City so perfectly. It is about the world being your oyster. I know the phrase of ‘The World Is Yours’ comes from Scarface. But Nas’ message was about showing Black America how to make the best choices so people can live a long life and have longevity. That kind of message doesn’t get old.”\n1994 is still considered one of the years of all time concerning East Coast hip-hop. With the release of projects such as Biggie Smalls’Ready To Die,Method Man’sTical,and Redman’sDare Iz A Darkside, New Yorkis seeing its own musical brilliance on full display. However, there is one album from 1994 that many would consider to be the best, and that is Nas’Illmatic.\nThat said, one of the album’s stand-out tracks was ‘N.Y. State Of Mind’. Produced by the legendary DJ Premier, the raw, simple beat has an ominous nature to it, and when Nas begins to skillfully rap about the violence of the Queensbridge housing projects, the combination is pure magic.\nOn the track, Nas uses incredible metaphors to explain the awful crimes he had witnessed and with lyrics such as “It’s like the game ain’t the same / Got younger niggas pulling the triggers, bringing fame to their name / And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners / In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us.” On the track Nas unapologetically tells listeners about the fate that some children meet in his neighbourhood.\nFurthermore, with lines such as “I know this crackhead who said she’s got to smoke nice rock / And if it’s good, she’ll bring you, customers, in measuring pots / But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information / Keeps large niggas erasin’ and their wives basin’” the lyricist rudely reminded listeners about how crack cocaine destroyed black neighbourhoods. From beginning to end, the song is flawless, and many consider it the greatest hip-hop song ever to be written.",

        "title": "Five times Kanye West collaborated with Wu-Tang Clan members",
        "description": "Kanye Westis a Hip Hop legend in his own right, but theappreciation he shows for greats that came before himshouldn’t be understated. His collaborations alongsideWu-Tang Clanmembers over the years is evidence of his respect for ’90s rappers who paved the way for him, whilst also providing them with a platform to reach a new generation of fans.\nYe has worked with everyone from RZA to Raekwon over the years, with Ghostface Killah going as far as calling him an extension of Wu-Tang Clan. It’s a mutual respect that even allowed members of the group to be part of a Grammy-winning album.\nAside from collaborations, West nodded to Wu-Tang as recent as this year by sampling ‘Can It All Be So Simple’ on ‘Keys to My Life’ from hisVultures 1album.\nBelow, take a listen to five collaborations between Kanye West and members of the legendary Wu-Tang Clan.\nKanye West assembled his G.O.O.D. Music label for their one and only compilation album in 2012. Cruel Summerfeatured a song called ‘The Morning’ that welcomed Raekwon into Ye’s world with a strong feature list that included Pusha T, Common, 2 Chainz, Cyhi the Prynce, Kid Cudi and D’banj.\nDespite the strong guests, Rae stole the show with his opening verse, rapping, “Barbecue and blow in the back of the crib/ Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit’s a gift/ All my n-ggas’ watches is rough/ Grabbin’ our crotches, yellin’, ‘What up?’ The jeans cost five hundred? Fuck,” to kick off the track. Effortless and slick as ever from a veteran of the genre.\nRZA‘s appearance onMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasyis one of the most memorable. Despite not having a verse on ‘So Appalled’, he put all of his energy into the chorus, bellowing, “Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches/ You know this shit is fuckin’ ridiculous/ Fuckin’ ridiculous/ You know this shit is fuckin’ ridiculous.”\nHis contribution set the foundation for Kanye West, JAY-Z, Pusha T and Cyhi the Prynce’s verses, equipped with some signature Swizz Beatz vocals.\nJustin Bieber might be the last person you’d expect to collaborate withRaekwon, especially in 2010 when he was riding off the success of pop hits such as ‘Baby’ and ‘Eenie Meenie’. But leave it to Kanye West to make the whole thing appear seamless.\nThe Chef laid down a verse on ‘Runaway Love’ that mentioned everything from International House of Pancakes to Bonnie and Clyde, sampling Wu-Tang Clan’s classic ‘Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit’. And it worked.\nThis wasn’t Rae’s only appearance in West’s G.O.O.D. Fridays series, either, having also featured on ‘Lord Lord Lord’ alongside Yasiin Bey.\n‘Back Like That’ featuring Ne-Yo remainsGhostface Killah‘s highest-charting solo single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Kanye West hopped on a remix of the track, providing the opening verse with a ton of celebrity mentions — we’re talking Eva Mendes, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Prince and Ne-Yo himself.\nGhostface and Kanye went on to collaborate once again this year, with Ye featuring on ‘No Face’ from hisSet the Tone (Guns & Roses)album. Their relationship is clearly still strong.\nAn undeniable fan favourite onMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Raekwon apparently had to be persuaded by RZA to feature on ‘Gorgeous’. His closing verse resulted in braggadocious raps about Mercedez-Benz, Jaguar and Lous Vuitton.\n“The first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he’s a hard worker,” Raekwon said about collaborating with Ye on the song. “When you look at him, you can tell that he still has that whole Hip Hop thing in his bones.”",

        "title": "Wind city slickers: The five best rappers from Chicago",
        "description": "Where do the best rappers in the world ofhip-hopcome from? The obvious answer is the United States, but without being close minded, let’s pay some respect to the iterations of hip hop that have been growing in popularity abroad.\nThe grime scene in the UK has seen the introduction of artists that have made waves beyond the shores of the relatively tiny island. Names such as Skepta, Central Cee and Dave, are known outside of London and Dublin these days. Whilst Latin American artists such as Bad Bunny, J Balvin and Daddy Yankee have been headline news in the music world for over a decade now.\nDo any of these names hold a candle to what has come out of the East and West coasts of the United States? In fairness, probably not. Repping the East Coast, we have the likes of Jay-Z, Asap Rocky and Lauryn Hill, and on the West we have 2pac, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Kim. This is without mentioning what seems like the endless supply of hip hop talent flowing out of Atlanta.\nAn often overlooked city when it comes to hip hop is Chicago. We might have to blame Michael Jordan for claiming the city for basketball despite the efforts of the burgeoning music scene. In an attempt to bring them out of Jordan’s shadow, we’ve decided to rank the 5 best rappers to hail from the capital of Illinois.\nStarting with a relatively new entry to the hip-hop game, Polo G seemed like he was always destined to do great things. His first track ‘Neva Cared’, went viral upon release. With projects titledDie a Legend, The GOATandHall of Famealready under his belt, you can be sure that he isn’t stopping any time soon.\nThe very definition of a modern rapper who leverages the asymmetric capabilities that the internet can provide, G’s combination of melodic tone, vivid imagery and vulnerability ushers in a new, refreshing take on hip hop.\nTwista’s prowess on the mic was overlooked slightly as, for a period of time, he was the world’s fastest English-speaking rapper. Consigning him more to pub trivia questions than concert halls.\nWith this speed, though, he pioneered the “chopping” style of rap, which involved stitching together bars at such a pace that a verse could be confused with the sounds of an automatic weapon or a helicopter. How many rappers can claim to have created their style? Not many.\nSimilar to Polo G, Juice Wrld leveraged melodic beats, which could be classified as dreamy, and introspective lyrics. Gone are the days when rappers only produce content about money, sex and violence. The late rapper would touch on themes that he felt were not spoken about enough in the music industry.\nBefore his death, at just 21 years of age in 2019, the man formerly known as Jarad Anthony Higgins had claimed the praise of hip-hop legend Eminem, who spoke on the Crooks Corner podcast following the former rapper’s death.\n“That kid was so talented, man,” he confirmed. “His freestyle that he did on Westwood where he rapped for an hour, like what the f**k! He might have been mixing a little bit of written in there, but that’s the sh*t that we tried to do at the hip hop shop, was work on our freestyle right? But to be able to slip in and out of written when you need to, you know what I’m saying. If you’ve got a certain punchline to take out this dude. To be so young, he mastered that so f**king quickly.”\nWhilst Twista might have created a style of rapping, Chief Keef has a solid claim to creating a new subgenre of hip hop. Synonymous with the US drill scene alongside pop smoke, many other hip hop artists have cited Keef as influential to their styles.His DIY approach to music production was revolutionary as he produced and recorded his own music without a label. Former Interscope A&R, Larry Jackson had this to say about how the game was revolutionised by these methods, “There was nobody who had the kind of gravitational pull he had online. He was the first.”\nWas it ever going to be anyone else? It is hard to define the greatness of the man who has possibly done more for the proliferation of hip hop than any other artist. With a genuine claim to having produced the greatest album of all time inMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, amongst other instant classics, Kanye is simultaneously an icon and an enigma. Trying to pick justone song to define his careerwould be painstaking.\nYes, he was probably wrong for interrupting Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the Grammys. Yes, he was definitely wrong for saying that slavery was a choice. But, given his self-proclaimed position as a “21st-century schizoid man”, this may be one of the rare cases where we can separate the art from the artist.\nOne might be able to question his character and for a good reason. However, what is unquestionable is his work ethic in producing music, which has altered his perception of what was possible. He is a generational talent.",

        "title": "Eminem names his 12 favourite diss tracks of all time",
        "description": "Eminem‘s had what can only be described as a breathtaking journey in his career. From being homeless, working fast food jobs and battle-rapping in the grimiest parts of Detroit, the young man was quickly flung into fame and was soon a Diamond-certified artist.\nThe rapper has remained open about his struggles and has always been brutally honest with himself and others. From his tenuous relationship with his mother, Debbie, to his battles with addiction, the rapper had tribulations.\nAt the turn of the millennium,The Slim Shady LPexploded into the mainstream and rose to become certified triple platinum by the end of the year. From here, Mathers became unstoppable and, for a decade, was one of hip hop’s best-selling artists.\nDespite all of the success, there is no denying Mathers’ career has seen dizzying heights and god-awful lows. Still, he didn’t succeed for no reason. Prior to blowing up, Eminem studied the art of rapping. Shortly after getting introduced to hip-hop by his uncle, Em quickly fell in love with what he heard and started absorbing the music of significant hip-hop artists like the Beastie Boys, Rakim, Masta Ace, LL Cool J, and N.W.A.\nOf course, as he was listening to the likes of N.W.A., Ice Cube and KRS-One, he learned a thing or two about diss tracks and fell in love with a particular handful of songs.\nRappers like Eminem write diss tracks for a pretty straightforward reason: hip-hop thrives on competition. Every now and then, you need that fearless artist to challenge others and fight for the number one position. It’s like a competitive sport, and in the world of rap, if you’re not keeping an eye on your rivals and watching your back, you can quickly go from being on top to at the bottom.\nGrabbing the hip-hop crown isn’t a walk in the park, especially when your rival is ready for you. More often than not, it turns into a fierce battle. Diss tracks have been a huge part of hip-hop history, and a solid one can catapult you to the top of the game. So, if you’re riding high on fame, get ready for some lyrical punches. Whether it’s Biggie Smalls or 50 Cent, being the best in hip-hop definitely has its price.\nOver the years, there have been tons of rivalries and clashes for the number one position. But the funny thing is, the culture doesn’t always agree on who has actually come out on top. Battles can get pretty heated, with hip-hop fans often picking sides. These battles have even split entire nations by region,like the East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry in 1990s hip-hop, which sadly led to two notorious deaths.\nEminem has even been involved in quite a few beefs himself and has been forced to pen some diss tracks. However, whether it’s Benzino or Machine Gun Kelly, the MCs who try to take him down never come close to winning.\nThat said, for a Christmas show on his Sirius XM Shade 45 radio station, Eminem, his longtime manager Paul Rosenberg, and DJ Whoo Kid sat down for a segment entitled “12 Days Of Diss-Mas,” during whichthe Detroit legendnamed his five favourite diss tracks of all time. You can see his interesting choices in a list compiled below.",

        "title": "Five classic songs Kanye West sampled on his ‘Bully’ album",
        "description": "Kanye Westsurprise-released his new album,Bully, on March 18th. Instead of putting the record on streaming platforms, he shared the music through a short film on Adobe’s Frame.io, directed by Hype Williams and starring his nine-year-old son, Saint.\nThe follow-up to 2021’sDondais rich with samples, which is something people have come to love from Ye. As he rapped on ‘I Love Kanye’ from 2016’sThe Life of Pablo, “I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye/ Chop up the soul Kanye.”\nWell, he’s delivered just that while combining elements of fan-loved albums like 2008’s808s & Heartbreakand 2010’sMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The project is also free of all the antisemitic and misogynistic language Ye has been spouting on social media recently.\nThroughout the album, Kanye samples music from the 1960s and ’70s, ranging from The Supremes to The Carpenters. Despite claiming the album is “not finished and half the vocals AI,” there’s still plenty of material to unpack.\nBelow, check out five classic songs Kanye sampled on hisBullyalbum.\nThe song known as ‘Beauty and the Beast’ samples The Mad Lads’ ‘Don’t Have to Shop Around’. The record appeared on the Memphis group’s 1966 album,In Action,and was previously used in J Dilla’s ‘Ahmad Impresses Me‘ in 1996 and Black Moon’s ‘High Times’ in 2002.\nOver the soulful vocals, Kanye raps, “Think about it every night and day/ To try to stay away, to keep my heart in here tucked/ Don’t take this as disrespect, I’m sitting here trying to redirect them.”\nOne of the album’s most notable samples is The Supremes’ ‘You Can’t Hurry Love’. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1966, and the melody is clear throughout the second track onBully. Ye samples the chorus’ memorable vocals, “You can’t hurry love/ No, you just have to wait/ She said, ‘Love don’t come easy’/ It’s a game of give and take.”\nOn ‘Can’t Hurry Love’, Ye sings, “We in another time we was designed for/ I got to rearrange it, move my mind forward/ Oh, move my mind forward.”\nKanye samples The Carpenters’ ‘(They Long To Be) Close to You’ on another song, known as ‘Close to You’. Not only does it include the famous 1970 lyrics, ‘Why do birds suddenly appear/ Every time that you are near /Just like me, they long to be/ Close to you,” with audio effects, but he also sings his words in the same melody.\nOn the track, he says, “Sometimеs, I just don’t wanna feel/ Attitudes, that appears/ Why I’m still, yeah, I’m still/ Closе to you, close to you.”\nThe opening track onBully, known as ‘Preacher Man’, samples the 1971 song ‘To You with Love’ by The Moments. Ye loops the vocals, “This ring that I hold/ I give to you (to you with love)/ I walk up to the preacher man,” throughout the record. The original track was previously sampled by J Dilla on ‘Last Donut of the Night’ from 2006’sDonutsalbum and Madlib on ‘Life’ in 2008.\nKanye brags about his superstar status on the track, rapping in the hook, “Light ’em up, beam me up/ The only G.O.A.T, the genius one/ They switchin’ sides, I seen it comin’/ The plot twist, a convenient one.”\nHip-hop fans will be well aware of Cortex’s ‘Huit Octobre 1971’ through MF DOOM, who sampled the song for ‘One Beer’ off 2004’sMm..Foodalbum. Kanye has also added himself to the sample’s history by making the record a key element of ‘Circles’, in which he chops up his vocals and sings, “Oh, Lord, I can’t miss this/ Oh, Lord, I got issues/ Oh, Lord, I don’t need shit/ Oh, Lord, hitting this one.”\nTyler, The Creator sampled the song for ‘Odd Toddlers’ off hisBastardalbum in 2009, with Wiz Khalifa also including it on ‘Visions’ off hisKush and Orange Juiceproject in 2010.",

        "title": "Five classic hip-hop songs that sample Roy Ayers",
        "description": "Jazz-funk pioneer Roy Ayers passed away on March 4th at 84. The legendary musician, best known for songs such as ‘Everybody Loves the Sunshine’, died after suffering a long-term illness.\n“It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist, composer, and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4th, 2025 in New York City after a long illness,” the Ayers family said in a statement, describing him as “highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.”\nThey aren’t wrong. Hip-hop has had an affinity for Ayers over the years, with rappers sampling his music since the early ’90s. From Common to The Game to Tyler, The Creator, the Los Angeles musician’s legacy can be heard across every generation.\nSpeaking toBonafide Magazinein 2021, Ayers shared his appreciation for being sampled in hip-hop. “A lot of people sample my music, a lot of artists,” he said. “And I’m very happy they sampled it because I feel good about it. I feel very good about it.”\nBelow, check out our list of five classic hip-hop songs that sample music from the late, great Ayers.\nA Tribe Called Quest sampled Roy Ayers for their classic 1991 song ‘Bonita Applebum‘, which appeared on their debut album,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. The record uses ‘Daylight’ by RAMP (Roy Ayers Music Productions), the soul/jazz band founded by Ayers, who wrote and produced songs for their only album,Come Into Knowledge. It was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and released in 1977.\nOriginally made in 1985, ‘Bonita Applebum’ was one of Tribe’s earliest demos and saw Q-Tip rapping about his love for a woman, rumoured to be about a girl from the rapper’s high school.\nAyers reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 after he was sampled on ‘Get Money’, a Junior MAFIA track from theirConspiracyalbum. It samples Sylvia Striplin’s 1981 song ‘You Can’t Turn Me Away Song’, which was written and produced by Ayers.Biggie Smalls and Lil Kimspit bold verses on the EZ Elpee-produced track, peaking at number 17 and spending 20 weeks on the chart.\nBiggie raps in the song, “Disrespect my clique, my shit’s imperial/ Fuck around and made her milk box material/ You feel me? Suckin’ dick, runnin’ your lips/ ‘Cause of you, I’m on some real ‘fuck-a-bitch’ shit.” Classic Notorious.\nLike the Junior M.A.F.I.A. track, Naughty by Nature’s ‘Hip Hop Hooray’ also samples Sylvia Striplin’s song for a bonafide hip-hop anthem. The track was released in 1992 and contains other samples from James Brown, the Five Stairsteps, the Isley Brothers, and Peter Gabriel—not a shabby lineup. It also boasts a music videodirected by Spike Lee, filmed in Brooklyn, New York City.\nNaughty member Vin Rock once said the song “will love forever,” adding, “‘Hip Hop Hooray’ sums up what hip-hop culture is: a celebration of the inner city’s ability to endure and create one of the largest music and art cultures in the world.” The song is certified platinum and reached number eight on the Hot 100.\nNas collaborated with DMXon ‘Life Is What You Make It’ in 1999, sampling Ayers’ ‘Vittroni’s Theme – King Is Dead’ from the soundtrack to the 1973 movieCoffy, starring Pam Grier. Appearing on hisI Am…album, the song finds the New York rappers rapping about living life to the fullest.\nNas spits in the first verse, “Can’t believe how my life changed/ From the hood, the first time in my life/ I can say I did the right thing.” L.E.S. produced the song and other album tracks, ‘Favor for a Favor’, ‘I Want to Talk to You’, ‘K-I-SS-I-N-G’ and ‘Undying Love’.\nRedman released his belovedMuddy Watersalbum in 1996, which was applauded so much that he dropped a sequel,Muddy Waters Too, in December last year. One of the highlights of the original LP was ‘Creepin’, a self-produced track that samples Ayers’ ‘Shining Symbol’, also from theCoffysoundtrack. A fierce Funk Doc isat his lyrical beston the record.\nWasting no time getting into the self-produced song, he raps from the first line, “To my no good n*ggas and my no good bitches/ Sorry if I left somebody leavin’ out with stitches/ Seems y’all too grown for ya britches/ Enslaved your mind like cotton pickers for runnin’ wit some rotten n*ggas.”",

        "title": "The top five hip-hop instrumentals of the 2010s",
        "description": "The sound ofhip-hopis an ever-changing organism that continues to evolve. From the 1980s until now, the sonics and aesthetics of rap music have changed dramatically. However, with each generation, a new producer sets a trend and steers the creative direction for hip-hop, and the 2010s was no different.\nThe decade saw some of theproduction styles of the 2000scarried forward while others were dropped. Although some of the most prominent beatmakers, such as Kanye West and Swizz Beatz, continued to adapt and push the envelope with their productions, other renowned musicians from the 2000s, such as Jazze Pha and Just Blaze, fell back.\nDifferent producers began to rise in the 2010s at various times. With the rise of A$AP Mob, Harlem-based beatmaker Araab Muzik became far more visible than he had been during the 2000s. Furthermore, as Tyler, The Creator and Odd Future rose on the West Coast, Flying Lotus.\nOther musicians who took hold of rap music during the 2010s include acclaimed hitmakers such as The Alchemist, Hit-Boy, Boi-1da, Tay Keith and 88-Keys. Still, some emerged more successful than others concerning number-ones and hits. In fact, in the late 2010s, J White Did It became an extremely popular choice for MCs wanting a number-one.\nWith his piano and bass formula, he successfully produced tracks such as Cardi B’s ‘Money’ and Iggy Azalea’s ‘Sally Walker’ with excellent results. In fact, other producers, such as Tay Keith, have gone quite far with this formula.\nOther producers, such as Cardo, also saw a massive surge in popularity during the 2010s, and every individual brought their own flavour to the table. Still, some beatmakers made hits that will last well beyond the 2010s. As such, we have compiled a list of thetop five hip-hop beatsmade in the 2010s.\nCardi B’s debut single was a blow-away track. ‘Bodak Yellow’ was indeed a phenomenon and was the dream debut single for any artist. Not only did it top the Billboard Hot 100, but it paved the way for a Grammy-award-winning project,Invasion Of Privacy.Still, the beat of ‘Bodak Yellow’ is fantastic for two reasons.\nThe beat was fantastically arranged with subtle build-ups, drops, and spaces, and Evan LaRay masterfully mixed the track. When heard in clubs, unlike other trap songs, all the elements of ‘Bodak Yellow’ cut through amazingly. Something that only an audio engineer would be able to appreciate. The instrumental, on its own, is unbelievable and it’s only upon deeper inspection that one can hear the hidden complexity of its arrangement.\nKendrick Lamar has always had a great ear for beats, and he rarely fails when it comes to selecting instrumentals. However, he completely knocked it out of the park with ‘Swimming Pools (Drank)’. The song, which appeared on his 2012 projectGood Kid m.A.A.d City,was made by Canadian record producer T-Minus and was so good it was nominated for ‘Best Rap Performance’ at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe song was created during T-Minus’ first studio session with Lamar. In an interview withDJ Boothmagazine, he recalled, “I played him a couple of tracks. ‘Swimming Pools’ was one of them, and he took it. He went back, and he came up with everything, the whole ‘Po’ up, drank’—all those ideas. They just asked me to do a switch-up, so I thought it would be dope to take it in another direction. A lot of people hardly ever hear that version because the single version is usually the one that’s out.”\nOVO’s in-house producer and superstar Boi-1da produced this iconic track, and its straightforward production and smooth chords made it stand out in a crowded hip-hop market. Released as the fourth single ofNothing Was The Same,which earned Drixzy an accolade at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards for ‘Best Rap Album.’ The beat was built with a series of samples, including, ‘Don’t Say A Word’ by Ellie Goulding, ‘Jimmy Smith Rap’ by Jimmy Smith, as well as the Wu-Tang Clan’s legendary single ‘C.R.E.A.M.’\nOpening up about how he made several minor tweaks to all of the samples he was presented with, Boi-1da explained toVicemagazine, “I stripped it down to just the sample and added some new drum programming and got Matthew to play some new chords. I was trying to go against the grain and get my own kind of bounce. I was thinking of something very simplistic for Drake to get some bars off, and I thought that was very much fitting.”\nThe beat of ‘Mask Off’ is iconic and played a massive part in its commercial success. In some circumstances, the backing track makes a song a hit, and that is arguably the case for this 2017 single from Future. Produced by the renowned St Louis beatmaker Metro Boomin, the single is known for its iconic flute melody and was a song that dominated the clubs.\nFew know that it was built around a sample. In fact, Future even once admitted toGeniusit was given to radio before it had clearance. The song became a diamond-certified single and was undoubtedly one of the most popular hip-hop songs released in the 2010s.\n‘All Of The Lights’ wasn’t just a song. It was a moment. The track’s production, done primarily by Kanye West with some help from instrumentalist Jeff Bhasker, was groundbreaking when it was released. It saw an amalgamation of sounds seamlessly brought together in a masterpiece. While speaking onVlad TV,Bhasker, who was with West in Hawaii for the studio session, unveiled that the beat’s skeleton was assembled relatively quickly, stating, “We did that in five minutes and had the basic aspect of it created.”\nHe continued, Then after that, it took many, many months and many, many versions of the drums and what’s supposed to happen. We had all ‘All Of The Lights’, and we knew it was a big record, but it wasn’t quite making sense, and then finally The-Dream put the melody on there and turned it into a real thing!”\n‘All Of The Lights’ had an all-star line-up featuring the likes of Rihanna, Elton John, John Legend, Kid Cudi, Fergie and many others. Unsurprisingly, the song earned West a Grammy Award for ‘Best Rap Song’ and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.",

        "title": "Top 5: The five best songs about New York neighbourhoods",
        "description": "Hip-hop music was born on the East Coast of America in the 1970s inNew York City,and as the home of hip-hop, it has produced some of the genre’s most renowned acts. New York City is the true Mecca of hip-hop music, and that is an unquestionable fact. Although there’s no doubt that people look to a specific city or region for their music at any given time,New York will always remain the pinnacle of hip-hop.\nThe official city of New York is comprised of five boroughs: The Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens. However, the greater metropolitan area of New York would also include parts of New Jersey and townships such as Mount Vernon and Yonkers. The city of New York dominated hip-hop for a long time. However, in the 1990s, with the rise of Los Angeles and the West Coast, the five boroughs had to cede some of their power and accept that they were no longer the only players in town. This continued to happen throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s.\nBy the 2010s, New York had fallen quite a way behind other regions of the US in terms of the number and calibre of stars it produced. However, it is still recognised asthe birthplace of hip-hopand the Mecca of rap music. Over the years, the different neighbourhoods of New York have asserted themselves.\nFrom Queensbridge and Harlem to Bed-Stuy and South Jamaica, each neighbourhood has attempted to claim the top spot in the city, and one way that some MCs do so is through their music. As such, we have compiled a list of the five best songs about New York neighbourhoods.\nNew York is the birthplace of hip-hop, and following its initial cultivation in the Bronx, one of the first places it landed was Harlem. The Manhattan neighbourhood has a rich cultural history and is home to some of the most iconic African-American celebrities.\nDuring the great migration in the late 1920s and early 30s, Harlem became a bastion of music, dance, art, fashion, literature and theatre. Still, concerning hip-hop, one of the quintessential Harlem collectives in the 2000s was The Diplomats. In this song, Jim Jones speaks about riding through “Washington Height” reflecting on how he would “set up on the stoop” near “7th and Lenox.”\nAlthough hip-hop culture originated in the Bronx, it is fair to say that in New York, the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens have arguably produced the biggest legends over time. From Biggie Smalls to Jay-Z and Big daddy Kane Brooklyn’s potency is undeniable.\nThe now-incarcerated Brooklyn emcee Casanova was a New york hit and with lyrics like “You from New York, which part are you from? / I looked at her like, “Are you dumb?” the lyricist really professes his pride in being a native Brooklynite.\nDuring the 1980s, Queensbridge quickly became one of the most culturally important neighbourhoods in hip-hop, producing a lot of talent. Artists such as Marley Marl, Craig G, Roxanne Shanté, and many more hail from the neighbourhood.\n‘The Bridge’ was a legendary diss track and one of the verses implicitly suggested that Queensbridge was where hip-hop started, rapping, “You love to hear the story, again and again / Of how it all got started way back when / The monument is right in your face / Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place, The Bridge, Queensbridge!”\nThe South Bronx is where hip-hop was born and the track ‘South Bronx’ was, in fact, only recorded after a misunderstanding. It was the seminal song of the ‘Bridge Wars’ between Boogie Down Productions and Juice crew.\nThe song was recorded to reassert that the South Bronx is where hip-hop was created as KRS-One thought MC Shan had said it grew from Queensbridge. The song is an emotional and aggressive ode to the culturally historic area of New York that is responsible for rap music.\nAlthough Ol’ Dirty Bastard was a part of the legendary Staten Island collective, the Wu-Tang Clan, he was RZA’s cousin who spent much time in Brooklyn and was raised there. In 1995, the outlandish and kooky released his debut solo project,Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version, which boasted the track ‘Brooklyn Zoo’.\nThe song describes utter chaos and the line “Shame on you, when you step through to The Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo” repeats itself throuhout the track. The song is truly legendary and many would consider it one of the best song Ol’ Dirty Bastard made during his career.",

        "title": "Top 5: The five most iconic rappers from Dallas",
        "description": "Dallas is home to many hip-hop artists who likely consider themselves the hottest or even the best in the game. Still, when it comes to icons, only MCs with amazing lyricism, quality delivery, and stage presence make it into the city’s hip-hop history book. For years,Dallashas had a globally underappreciated rap scene, and to this day, some of the city’s talent fly under the radar.\nLocals will know the likes of Play-N-Skillz and larger-than-life rappers like Tum Tum, Big Tuck, and Fat Bastard. Still, althoughpeople are looking to the Southfor their hip-hop, many are only looking at the Houston area for Texas talent. As such, Dallas continues to be neglected despite its rich cultural history.\nUnlike Atlanta’s trap scene, there isn’t merely one sound that represents the whole area. Over the years, the Dallas and Fort Worth region has split into various creative pockets that give rise to exciting artists, some of whom have gone on to have moderate success.\nSome of the city’s more recent successes include Cuban Doll, Asian Doll, Diego Money, The Outfit, TX, and more. However, as newcomers to the game, they aren’t icons yet. Below is a list of some of the icons Dallas has produced over the years.\nYella Beezy is the most contemporary on this list of Dallas icons. The Oak Cliff emcee saw a huge surge in the late 2010s and made sure to represent his city in interviews and in his music. The 33-year-old lyricist worked with the likes of Pharrell Williams, Quavo and Gucci Mane. Furthermore, he received love from other SOuther stars, including T.I., 2 Chainz, Jeezy, Boosie Badazz, and Rich the Kid.\nHe first broke onto the Texas scene after the release of his 2017 mixtapeLite Work Vol. 2and later signed a significant record deal with LA Reid’s Hitco label, which led to him opening for Jay-Z and Beyoncé when they made tour stops in Dallas and Houston. However, various legal issues have stunted his growth in recent years, but he is still as powerful as ever.\nAzim (formerly known as MC Azim) rose to fame in Dallas as part of the Nemesis collective alongside DJ Snake, Big Al, Joe Macc and Ron C. In Dallas itself, the group is widely considered the first collective to effectively gain notoriety on a nationwide scale. The group was unique in its sound as it appealed to the West Coast with its gangsta rap material, the South with some of its grimy basses and also to Florida as many of their tracks drew from the Miami bass scene.\nAzim was merely one of the most successful figures from the group as he was able to launch a solo career with the help of Profile Records. With extensive production from Doc Funk and William ‘Bumble B.H.E.’ Jackson Azim, his 1993 debut,10 Deep On A Solo Creep, was a smash.\nMr Pookie is undoubtedly one of Dallas’ early hip-hop legends. Although he was never signed to a major label, his 1999 debut album,Tha Rippla, was one of the most successful independently released projects to ever come out of Dallas, and Mr Pookie was a big name in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and more.\nDespite the power of Houstonby this point in rap history, North Dallas’ Mr Pookie kept his operation local and prioritised collaborations with the likes of Mr Lucci and K-Roc. Despite this, in 2000, he joined forces with Houston’s DJ Screw to release a ‘Chopped & Screwed’ version of his debut album, and in 2004 also made a guest appearance on Paul Wall’s last independent solo project,Chick Magnet.\nAfter the Beastie Boys, one of the first white solo acts to break onto the hip-hop scene was Vanilla Ice. Despite the culture perceiving him as a gimmick, the Dallas emcee did become an icon, and despite the hate he received, he contributed a lot to the Dallas hip-hop scene.\nVanilla Ice began his career as a breakdancer and occasionally performed raps at nightclubs across Dallas with acts such as D-Shay and Zero, as well as Earthquake, who was the resident DJ at the South Dallas nightclub City Lights. However, he quickly became a sensation among the city’s white residents and soon across the US.\nThe DOC is undoubtedly the best-known artist to come out of Dallas. The D.O.C. first rose to prominence as part of the well-known Dallas-based crew, the Fila Fresh Crew, one of the city’s gems. The gangsta rap collective ended up collaborating with N.W.A. in the ‘90s, and after several years of collaboration, The DOC ended up signing with Eazy-E and moving to California.\nIn 1989, as an official part of the California scene, The DOC ended up putting his trust in Dr Dre, who executively produced his debut album,No One Can Do It Better.The platinum-certified record debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200, making him one of the first Dallas MCs to successfully crossover into the mainstream.",

        "title": "Top 5: The five best hip-hop albums from 2006",
        "description": "The 2000swere legendary for hip-hop, not only because it was waving goodbye to the bloodshed and horror of the 1990s East Coast vs. West Coast calamity but also because it was about to advance. The violence that plagued the genre of hip-hop towards the latter end of the 1990s prevented artists from working with each other. Regional divisions stunted hip-hop’s growth as they prevented synergies from developing. However, at the turn of the millennium, this all changed.\nIn a documentary about the East Coast vs. West Coast beef, Snoop Dogg is quoted as saying that 2Pac and The Notorious BIG had to die for hip hop to evolve, and it did. The 2000s saw the fusion of R’n’B and hip hop take off while simultaneously, an electronification took place. People from all different regions came together to create fantastic music, resulting in progress. With so many amazing artists and sounds developing in the 2000s, hip-hop took a step forward.\nDuring the 2000s, some artists adopted a commercial sound while others created a new one, and the artists who created sounds impacted the genre profoundly.The 2000s most definitely had a distinct sound.However, each year had a defining hip-hop album and a defining artist.\nMany say that50 Cent defined hip-hop in 2003due to the sheer magnitude of his debut,Get Rich Or Die Tryin’,and the release of G-Unit’sBeg For Mercy.However, there were more years to come, and as different MCs began to emerge, they created a change. In 2006, different shifts were happening, and the top five albums of that year partially shed light on some of the biggest waves shaping hip-hop.\nThe Big Bang TheoryBusta Rhymes‘ only album to reach number one and topped the charts for a reason. The project’s second single, ‘I Love My Bitch’ featuring Kelis, is seen as a classic, and the album’s lead single, ‘Touch It’, had over four remixes. The Swizz Beatz-produced track became a club anthem and is played to this day.\nAlthough Busta Rymes’ prime may have been considered the 1990s, this 2006 project meant that the Brooklyn legend had a footprint in the 2000s and didn’t go through the era completely unnoticed. Still, in the eyes of many, the album boasts hidden gems that are often underappreciated.\nThe release ofPort Of Miamiwas a moment in hip-hop and a big deal for Florida, which hadn’t produced a heavy-hitting emcee since Trick Daddy. That said,Rick Ross’ debut did more than put Miami on the map. It blew other albums out of the water.\nPort of Miamispawned several platinum hits, but the most recognisable hit is ‘Hustlin, ‘Ross’s breakthrough track. The track went two times platinum and had several remixes, including one featuring Jay-Z and Young Jeezy. An unofficial remix was created featuring Lil Wayne, Z-Ro, Jay-Z, T.I., Busta Rhymes, Remy Ma, Young Jeezy, and Lil Flip. However, it got scrapped after being leaked in poor quality. Still,Port Of Miamiincluded other anthems such as ‘Push It’.\nVallejo rapperE-40was one of the biggest MCs from the Bay Area during the 1990s. However, at the turn of the millennium, so many new acts came along that The Click founder fell into the background slightly. Even he noticed a change with his 2006 albumMy Ghetto Report Cardand has spoken about how the multi-platinum album revived his career on several occasions.\nDuring an interview withThe New York Times, the rapper explained, “When I came out withMy Ghetto Report Card, I was 37, 38 years old. My whole career just revived. It was amazing. I was part of the crunk movement and the hyphy movement at the same time. ‘U and Dat,’ ‘Snap Yo Fingers,’ and so on. We had the South and the West Coast.” The songs he mentioned were certified anthems, and ‘Tell Me When To Go’ helped elevate the Bay’s hyphy movement.\nBy 2006,Snoop Dogghad evolved his sound several times. Following his 1998 project,Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told, Snoop manoeuvred away from his G-funk sound and found great success with The Neptunes. This was the case until 2006 when he decided to produce a commercially viable album without the oversight of Pharrell Williams, andThe Blue Carpet Treatmentsaw some fantastic music.\nHits such as ‘ That’s That Shit’ and ‘LAX’ saw the Long Beach legend reach out to a slew of new producers to make iconic and long-lasting music. Furthermore, it also saw theDoggystylecreator reach out to some West Coast artists he hadn’t worked with while on Death Row, including the likes of E-40, Ice Cube, MC Eiht and his old friend Goldie Loc.\nJ Dilla‘sDonutsis a truly seminal album, and although it may not have been the highest-selling hip-hop project of 2006, it is undoubtedly the most renowned. In 2002, Dilla was diagnosed with a dreadful illness. Suffering from thrombocytopenic purpura combined with lupus. That said, by 2006, his condition was terminal, but being a true musician, the Detroit producer decided to work on one more album to show his one-of-a-kind production skills.\nWhile he was wheelchair-bound and dying, J Dilla madeDonuts, and 29 of the album’s 31 tracks were made in his hospital room. Its chaotic yet beautiful arrangement was perceived by many as the beatmaker’s way of musically confronting death and the notion of an afterlife. The 2006 body of work is widely considered to be the musical output of an individual who was aware they were dying and is one of the holy grails of hip-hop production.",

        "title": "Five things we learned from Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl show",
        "description": "The Super Bowl halftime show is always a momentous occasion. On February 9th,Kendrick Lamarbecame the first solo rapper to headline the big event, having previously been brought out as a special guest during Dr Dre’s show several years ago.\nUnsurprisingly, the performance was full of notable moments. The Compton rapper continued to diss Drake in the most brutal ways throughout, while Samuel L Jackson swapped the movie screen for the biggest stage in music.\n“I think I’ve always been very open about storytelling through all my catalogue and my history of music,” Kendrick said in apress conference before the Super Bowl. “This is me. This is Kendrick Lamar, 37 years old, and I still feel like I’m elevating, I’m still on a journey.” He delivered just that.\nBelow, check out five things we learned from Kendrick’s Super Bowl halftime show performance.\nOne of the most talked about things ahead of the Super Bowl was whether Kendrick would take the opportunity to take further jabs at Drake, and he didn’t disappoint. Followingtheir beef last year, K. Dot performed diss tracks ‘Euphoria’ and most famously ‘Not Like Us’. He teased the latter song throughout, telling the audience, “I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they love to sue,” referencing Drake’s lawsuit against Universal Music Group.\nWhen it finally came the performance, Kendrick looked into the camera and said, “Say, Drake, I hear you like ‘em young,” while smiling. Although he held back on outright calling Drake a paedophile, the crowd sang along in unison when he rapped, “Tryna strike a chord and it’s probably A minor.”\nThe final blow was the words “game over” illuminated in the crowd at the end of the halftime show, seemingly putting the nails in the coffin of their rap beef.\npic.twitter.com/JCkFS5enpy\nOne of the biggest surprises of the night was Samuel L Jackson narrating the entire halftime show as “Uncle Sam.” The legendary actor wore a blue coat and patriotic top hat, complete with red, white and blue colours.\n“Salutations, it’s your uncle, Sam, and this is the great American game,” Jackson said at the start of the show to introduce Kendrick. Then, before performing ‘HUMBLE‘, he returned to say, “No, no, no. Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto. Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game? Then tighten up.”\nAfter performing his SZA collaborations, Jackson said, “Yeah, yeah, that’s what I’m talking about. That’s what America wants. Nice and calm. You’re almost there. Don’t mess this up.” Kendrick then went in the complete opposite direction, performing his brutal Drake beatdown, ‘Not Like Us’.\nUNCLE SAM 👊🏾‼️#SBLIX#SuperBowlLIXpic.twitter.com/WN547n2lRe\nDrake once dated Serena Williams, so her appearance on stage is likely not coincidental. The tennis legend, who also grew up in Compton, Crip-walked on stage during Kendrick’s performance of ‘Not Like Us’.\nWilliams previously mentioned the beef at the ESPYs last year. “If I’ve learned anything this year, it’s that none of us, not a single one of us, not even me, should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar,” she said. “He will make your hometown not like you. The next time Drake sits courtside at a [Toronto] Raptors game, they’re going to Forrest Gump him. Seats taken.”\nDrake revealed that his 2016 song ‘Too Good’featuring Rihannawas about Williams, while mentioning her specifically on his 2022 track ‘Middle of the Ocean’.\nSerena Williams had to pop off with Kendrick during “Not Like Us”Compton’s finest 😤pic.twitter.com/9OIvVcmNnR\nKendrick and SZA have built an undeniable chemistry and it was clear for all to see during the Super Bowl halftime show. The TDE singer appeared on stage for ‘Luther’ from Kendrick’s recent album,GNX, before performing their hit single ‘All the Stars’ from theBlack Panthersoundtrack. The crowd erupted when SZA sang the chorus of the hit song, which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe pair are also hitting the road together this year on the Grand National Tour, so this is just a taste of what’s to come. The’ve previously collaborated on other songs such as ’30 for 30′, ‘Gloria’, ‘Doves in the Wind’, ‘Babylon’ and Jay Rock’s ‘Easy Bake’, with SZA even revealing she wants them torecord a collaborative album.\nOH KENDRICK & SZA ABSOLUTELY CHEWED😭😭😭pic.twitter.com/hXdgMvX4Gy\nDuring Kendrick’s performance of ‘TV Off‘, which saw him bring out the song’s producer, Mustard, the show was interrupted by a protestor holding a Sudanese-Palestinian flag with Sudan and Gaza written on it.\nHowever, the NFL confirmed that, rather than being a pitch invader, the individual was one of the 400 cast members for the performance. The New Orleans Police Department said that “law enforcement is working to determine applicable charges in this incident.” While standing on Kendrick’s prop car, the man waved his flag around before running down to the field and being grabbed by security.\n“The individual will (be) banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events,” NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy told theAssociated Pressin a statement. “The individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show. No one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.”\nProtester sneaks on stage during Kendrick Lamar halftime show with a Palestine flag and gets escorted off quickly#superbowlpic.twitter.com/ux7EOvxMvn",

        "title": "Five times diss tracks ended entire careers",
        "description": "Rappers write diss tracks for a pretty straightforward reason:hip-hopthrives on competition. Every now and then, you need that fearless artist to challenge others and fight for the number one position. It’s like a competitive sport and in the world of rap, if you’re not keeping an eye on your rivals and watching your back, you can quickly go from being on top to at the bottom.\nGrabbing the hip-hop crown isn’t a walk in the park, especially when your rival is ready for you. More often than not, it turns into a fierce battle.Diss tracks have been a huge part of hip-hop history, and a solid one can catapult you to the top of the game. So, if you’re riding high on fame, get ready for some lyrical punches. Whether it’s Biggie Smalls or 50 Cent, being the best in hip-hop definitely has its price.\nOver the years, there have been tons of rivalries and clashes for the number one position. But the funny thing is, the culture doesn’t always agree on who has actually come out on top. Battles can get pretty heated, with hip-hop fans often picking sides. These battles have even split entire nations by region, likethe East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry in ’90ship-hop, which sadly led to two notorious deaths.\nStill, sometimes a diss track can lead to an emcee on the receiving end losing their career. On occasion, a track can be so explosive, jaw-dropping and revealing that the target struggles to find a way to repair their image, reputation and place in hip-hop. Once in a while, we hear these kinds of songs, and the fallout is insane. That said, below, we have compiled a list of the five times a diss track ended an artist’s career.\nPusha T’s diss track ‘The Story Of Adidon’, put a serious stain on Drake’s career. The song revealed the Toronto native had a son named Adonis, who he had been keeping out of the limelight, and its cover was an unedited, real-life picture of Drake in blackface as a minstrel. The cover was a 2007 photograph of Drake in blackface taken by David Leyes and after the song’s release, Drake had to go on damage control, telling the public, it was “to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much.”\nHowever, the revelation that Drake had a son was a body blow for theScorpioncreator as he had not only hidden Adonis for years but also kept his previous relationship with Sophie Brussaux a secret. ‘The Story Of Adidon’ was so destructive for Drake’s career because it also revealed that Brussaux started her career as an adult film star. Although the diss track did not end Drizzy’s career, it slowed it down and tarnished his brand.\nEminem’s ‘Killshot’ diss track for Machine Gun Kelly (MGK) was a savage response to Baker’s song ‘Rap Devil’ on which he attacks Mathers ruthlessly. The beef between Eminem and MGK began when the latter began talking about the ‘Stan’ rapper’s daughter during a press run.\nThe Detroit native is very sensitive about his daughter and effectively ended MGK’s hip-hop career with ‘Kill Shot’. With lines like, “Ho, chill, actin’ like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow / Gunner? Bitch, you ain’t a bow and arrow / Say you’ll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin’ lead / Playin’ dead, that’s the only time you hold still” and “As big as you’re gonna get, so enjoy it / Had to give you a career to destroy it / Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep,” the track was potent. In fact, MGK began recording rock music shortly after due to the embarrassment he was to hip-hop culture.\nBetween 2009 and 2011, Rick Ross and 50 Cent exchanged many tracks as the former began to ascend with his Maybach Music Group Crew. However, the ‘In Da Club’ emcee effectively destroyed Rick Ross’ career when he unveiled that the Miami rhymer used to be a police officer.\nAs such, he made a diss track entitled ‘Officer Ricky’ to put Ross in his place and let fans know that he believed the MMG founder was a fake gangster. On the track, Jackson raps, “I tell you straight suck a dick / You tryna come with subliminals / Cuz your ass the police / My n*ggas is criminals.” One of the more controversial lines heard Jackson continue, “The cop f*ck wit fox, suck the c*nt on a bimbo / F*ggot must’ve thought he knock me out like Kimbo.”\nIce Cube is undeniably one of the most notorious LA rappers, so when he decided to leave his crew, NWA, in 1989 over disputes about money, he had more than a little to get off his chest.\nIn 1991, Cube released ‘No Vaseline’, a diss track aimed at his former bandmates, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella and their manager, Jerry Heller. In the track, he tells Dr. Dre to stop rapping and “stick to producing” and, on multiple occasions, accuses the crew members of sodomy. ‘No Vaseline’ is a ruthless and vicious diss track and effectively ended NWA and the power of Eazy-E in hip-hop.\nKendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ was a career-destroying track for Drake. Not only did it cause Drake’s empire and image to implode but it brought a lot of weird things that had previously been in the dark to light. Furthermore, the diss track made the culture as a whole double-guess why Drake had become so big compared to other, more talented individuals.\nWith lyrics like “And Party at the party playin’ with his nose now / And Baka got a weird case, why is he around? / Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles” and “You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars / No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin’ colonizer” Kendrick Lamar finished the job done by Pusha T by causing Drake to completely crumble. Now theTake Carecreator’s brand is in disrepute with no way to come back.",

        "title": "Five things we learned from the 2Pac and Biggie Smalls beef",
        "description": "The West Coast vs East Coast feud that plagued hip hop during the 1990s, as much as it may have entertained the culture, was an amalgamation of bloodshed and pure horror that ultimately ended with the deaths of two amazingly talented rappers:2pacand Biggie Smalls. However, the origin of the beef is complex and often misunderstood.\nThe landscape of hip-hop looked vastly different in the 1990s than it is today. When we’re looking at 1990s hip hop, we’re looking (for the most part) at two feuding record labels, Death Row Records on the West Coast and Badboy Entertainment on the East Coast. Both companies had their stars, with 2pac signed to Death Rowand The Notorious B.I.G to Bad Boy.\nRespectively, these two artists, with their affiliates, i.e. Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, Suge Knight, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and Diddy, were ruling the rap charts and selling unfathomable amounts of records with their feud actually fuelling sales. The origin of the regional feud actually began with2pac and Biggie’s friendship. The two, as the biggest rap stars in the US, were, at first. However, one incident changed all of that.\nIn 1994, the rapper was ambushed and shot in the lobby of Quad studios, and according to 2Pac, he recognised two of the three men as associates of his Biggie Smalls. With 2pac effectively forcing his record label and crew to pick a side in what he considered a war, the two labels were officially enemies. With one headquartered on the West Coast in LA and one headquartered on the East Coast in New York, it spread like a virus going from two artists to two labels to two whole states.\nThe beef resulted in two murders. However, there are at least five things that hip-hop fans learned from the death of these artists, and retrospectively, we can see where things went wrong for them both.\nThe amount of people an artist has around them can sometimes be the thing that makes or breaks them. In fact, on more than one occasion, it has been proven that the bigger your entourage is, the more likely you are to fail as an artist. Whether it’s Tekashi 6ix9ine spending time in jail due to the Nine Trey Gangster Bloods, he surrounded himself with or King Von’sVon’s murder due to his entourage of Black Disciples, a massive, potentially rowdy group of young men is an unwise choice of company.\nThis was very much involved in 2Pac’s murder, and the same can be said for Biggie Smalls. In their prime, both artists surrounded themselves with large entourages. Furthermore, many people in both their entourages had street connections and little to lose. This meant that 2Pac and Biggie Smalls had people in their ears, fuelling the beef and sturring the pot who need not be there.\nWhether it’s Birdman, Jerry Heller, Dame Dash, or Gucci Mane, when rappers sign to other MCs who have made it to the mainstream and are already wealthy, some people grab the money and sign the deal like they have won the lottery. However, hip-hop has repeatedly seen its favourite artists speak about unfair contracts and relationships turned sour. MCs should always be careful about who they put their trust in and who is profiting from them.\nIn retrospect, it is fair to say that both Suge Knight and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs were not responsible for their signees. During the East Coast vs West Coast beef, the label heads fuelled the fire to such an extent their artists were murdered. But following their death, they still owned the masters. Combs and Knight were unhelpful and pushed the negativity. A lesson hip-hop should learn is that just because a figure offers you a record deal does not mean they are your friend or intend to send you in the right direction. Bluntly, perhaps 2Pac should have had some more scepticism about Suge Knight, and the same applies to Biggie concerning Diddy.\nMany street feuds are fought over the gang people belong to and what block they represent. Although these dynamics may be suitable on a small scale, once applied to the US map, it’s not wise or sustainable to turn a personal disagreement into a regional beef. Once you’re a nationwide phenomenon, you are no longer just a person “from” California; you are nationwide, and it is clear from the 2Pac’s approach to Biggie Smalls that he was willing to sacrifice where he was at to represent where he was from.\nWith his diss track ‘Hit Em Up’ constantly reminding listeners how he was from “West Side”, towards the end of his career, it almost seemed as if he was more focused on his “Side” winning in a regional beef than maintaining his position as a superstar with amazing and insightful songs.\nNowadays, rappers don’t stay in their city and record labels with a fixed address and recording location aren’t a big thing. Concerning the 2Pac and Biggie feud, with the former recording at the Death Row studios in Los Angeles’ Tarzana neighbourhood and the latter in Bad Boy’s Manhattan, it was easy to predict where these artists would be regularly. Many artists live and record in cities they weren’t born in or moved to for safety. In an interview withVlad TV,Boosie Badazz once highlighted how he would never move to his hometown of Baton Rouge as he had too much history and dangerous affiliations there.\nOther rhymers have expressed a similar sentiment, and it is safe to say that an artist like 2Pac could have and should have made a home away from home where they weren’t privy to the psychodrama of the streets. With LA native and infamous gangster Suge Knight at his side, it is safe to say it was probably never safe for 2Pac to be in LA. The same can be said for Biggie, and the epic battle that ensued may not have been so fierce if the two legends hadn’t been tied down to their respective home states.\nThis is an obvious yet ironically the most important lesson learned from the 2Pac and Biggie Smalls feud. Although many have put 2Pac’s gangster credentials into question over the years, his brash, aggressive and gang-affiliated spectacles were a part of his demise.\nAlthough the ‘Dear Mama’ lyricist was a star who could afford protection, it appeared that he thought that, with the protection of Suge Knight, he was immortal. 2Pac may have had a lot of loyal LA bloods riding for him, but when worst came to worst, the bare-chested, tough guy from the ‘Hit ‘Em Up’ music video was murdered with ease. Still, unfortunately, it seems many artists have not learnt this lesson, and this decade, we have already seen many rappers face trial for all kinds of charges.",

This is probably the reason you’re not allowed to play your music around your grandparents.\nAs hip-hop transitioned in the 1990s, it took on a different form as gangsta rap became the prevailing sub-genre; eventually taking over the entire game. The point of gangsta rap was to harness the shared experiences that a lot of the artists lived through growing up on the streets.\nA lot of these shared experiences came as a direct result of the gang affiliations the artists were involved with. Drug pushing was and remains one of the biggest gang activities, so artists heavily referenced drugs in their songs to boast and brag about being the baddest.\nWeed became the drug of choice to rap about, but also for personal use, as a lot of rappers, whose bank accounts significantly grew, realised they could absolutely afford to fund their chilling habit. This boom in popularity was definitely helped by none other than Snoop Dogg, who has since somehow become the global face of the drug. Inspired by Snoop, here are the five best songs about the green.\nRedmankicks off the list with a generous effort to educate the next generation on how to enjoy the loud. The track featured in Redman and Method Man’s 1991 movie,How High?, which sees the two smoke some magic weed that helps them get into the prestigious Harvard University.\nThe track is a step-by-step guide to a good time before the days of YouTube instructional videos, back when you’d have to ask the shady guy in the neighbourhood to do it for you. The song shouts out weed-lover legends Phillies Blunt as the brand of choice and even includes the secret to keeping the roll spit-free. What a considerate guy.\nThis list would be a disgrace if we didn’t include the Jamaican ‘God of Ganga’, Bob Marley. He istheRasta whose entire sound and look scream stoned and relaxed. Marley returns with his signature chilled-out and soulful sound to present ‘Kaya’, which, if you hadn’t guessed, is of course another name for weed.\nThe track is a feel-good experience, and it should be the first thing you put on the speakers after your first couple of tokes. This is Marley’s love letter to weed, and boy, does he love it. He lets the beat do most of the talking, periodically chiming in to remind us of how good he feels smoking that green.\nIt should come as no surprise that Afroman’s 2000 offering has a place on this list. His hilarious song will easily crack you up if you’re susceptible to the giggles. Afroman himself is clearly a connoisseur of all the strains, and his relaxed tone and approach to the beat sounds like he probably smoked before the studio session. Our suspicions are confirmed in the final verse.\nIn the song, the rapper goes on to list all the things he was going to do, like clean his room, go to work and even pay his child support, but he didn’t, because he got high. He also goes on to warn of the risks of overconsumption of blunts; he lost his family because he got high. Afroman, what an inspiration.\nShockingly, the California native comes in back-to-back with his tune ‘Crazy Rap’. This song is a coming-of-age rite-of-passage experience for every 15 and 16-year-old. He comes back on this track with another comical story of all the women he meets as he smokes the days away.\nThe lyrics “Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby that’s all we need” are burnt into the brains of every stoner; this was probably their first smoke song. Afro keeps it chill and simple with the clear message that cheap booze and a pair of zoots are all that’s required for a good time. A simple message from the rapper that we can all agree with.\nWho else was going to top this list, let’s be real. Snoop along with other mega-stonerWiz Khalifa, maybe inspired by Redman and Method Man, created this song for their cult classic 2012 movieMack and Devin Go To High School.The movie follows both a high school overachiever and a senior entering his 15th year of school and includes a famous talking blunt.\nThe smoking technique-titled track has such a loosening effect that your shoulders drop lower and your eyes get redder as you exhale in unison with the chorus. Both artists offer their soft-spoken lyrics bragging about their status as veteran weed smokers. The D O double G takes the crown, though, with his Uber-cool verse and as the biggest smoke, because, of course, he does.",

        "title": "The five greatest guest verses from 2 Chainz",
        "description": "There may not be a hip hop MC who has a more peculiar background than Tauheed Epps, or as he’s more commonly known,2 Chainz. Graduating second in his class from North Clayton High School in College Park, Georgia, and then going on to gain a basketball scholarship at Alabama State University, 2 Chainz appeared to be on the path to a ‘traditional’ career. Rumours even circulated that he graduated from college with a 4.0 GPA. These were soon quashed with the rapper saying, “Don’t believe anything on Wack-ipedia. There’s a lot of false stuff on there, to the point that every time I try to fix one thing, something else comes out”.\nGiven his aptitude in other fields, it would seem that a career in music wasn’t on the cards. Still, in 1997, alongside his high school friend Earl Conyers, 2 Chainz, or as he was known at the time, Tity Boi, formed the group Playaz Circle. After a successful stint as a duo, including getting signed to Ludacris’ Disturbing Tha Peace label, a subsidiary of Def Jam Records, Tity Boi decided to pursue his solo career.\nIn 2011, he officially changed his name to 2 Chainz.Vibemagazineunearthed the meaning of his former name: “The name Tity Boi actually came from my big mama, from me being spoiled and an only child—breastfed.” Following the release of his debut studio album,Based on A TRU story,2 Chainz has never looked back, building a career thatwould be the envy of the majority of MCs in the game.\nHis collaboration with respected figures outside of the music world has also been impressive, hosting his own YouUube series ‘Most Expensivest’ withGentleman’s Quarterly, opening The Pink Trap House Museum in Atlanta, an ode to trap music, and also purchasing a minority stake in the Atlanta Hawks and their G-league affiliate based in his hometown of College Park. Going along with these excellent collaborations, arguably his greatest impact has come in his work alongside fellow musicians. Below we explore his top 5 guest verses.\nThis might be an odd choice to include in a list of hip-hop features. But the reason that this guest verse is so impactful is down to the fact that it’s so surprising to hear the iconic, elongated “2 Chainz” after the bridge.\nThe lyrics are, of course, crass, and to the disliking of a few (myself included), repetitive. But the cadence of 2 Chainz’s deep voice in conjunction with the brass instruments makes this a guest verse to remember.\nAccompanying the vocals of some of the biggest rappers in the game is nothing new for 2 Chainz. His collaboration withTravis Scottand Future reached number 82 on the Billboard top 100. Which was perhaps overshadowed by the standout track from Scott’s 2015 albumRodeo, ‘Antidote’.\nContrast is the key to this flow’s allure. While Scott and Future leverage pace and auto tune, flitting between one another in the early stages of the track, 2 Chainz starts his verse slowly. The absence of drums allows space for his voice to set the tone before his message is hammered home, aided by 808s, even adding a reference to his former name.\nWith an upbeat tempo that makes you want to jump around, this track seems like it was made with 2 Chainz in mind (He’s even seen taking and making a jump shot in the music video).\nThe verse starts with a nod to Petey Pablo and his 2001 track ‘Raise up’: “Petey Pablo take your shirt off/ Wave it around your head like a helicopter”, and continues with that energy throughout. The verse ends with a classic sign-off line which surely would feature on every teenage boy’s MSN Messenger status (if MSN Messenger was still a thing): “School of hard knocks/ I took night classes.”\nIn one of his faster flows, Two Chainz is once again able to show off his contrasting style compared to his collaborators, aided by the producers’ switch-up in the beat.\nWith only a few chords and notes from the piano accompanied by reverberations from the chorus, Kendrick still asks, “Are we on ten yet?” This verse takes the listener on a journey through its use of tempo, filtration, and clever word play.\nAs we’ve progressed along this list, it would seem that 2 Chainz has gradually increased the potency of his short stint on tracks. Straying away from convention, just like the man himself, we find ourselves going back more than a decade for the pièce de résistance.\nBefore the release of his debut studio album, his work alongside Kanye, Big Sean, andPusha Treached a peak of 13 on the Billboard top 100, which could be argued to have paved the way for his future success.\nTasked with the last verse on this track, preceded by Kanye’s, which leverages synths, is bass-heavy and appears to be building to something big, 2 Chainz brings it all crashing down, accompanied by 3 piano notes on repeat.\nThere are too many bars to repeat here without mentioning the entire verse. However, two that still stand out today are “Drunk and high at the same time/ Drinking champagne on the airplane” and “100 bands, cut your girl/ Now you girl need a band-aid”, punctuated with an ad lib of “Damn” which may have been included due to its pure authenticity.\n\n",

        "title": "The five worst songs by J Cole",
        "description": "J Colehas flown under the radar a little bit in recent months after gracefully bowing out of the ‘Big 3’ beef that would engulf his two other contemporaries. Wisely pulling out of the conflict before it turned into a full-blown war, the Fayetteville rapper managed to escape with only a bruised ego after publicly apologising to Kendrick for releasing ‘7-minute drill’.\nSeeing as he was spared (mostly) from the crossfire of the war between Compton and Toronto, we thought we’d bring him back into the spotlight with a look into some of theworstwork that he has produced in his career. Be warned, there are a couple of tracks in here that you might be shocked that Cole signed off on.\nInitially, the task at hand seemed simple. With over a decade’s worth of music to dig into, there were sure to be some misses. As I pored over his discography, though, I came to appreciate that this would be no easy feat. Every track that the German-born rapper has produced to date has some redeemable qualities. As such, some of the selections may be a little nit-picky, but needs must.\nPlease note that the following is highly subjective. The facets of the music that I dislike might just be what you admire. So before you light your torches and sharpen your pitchforks, just remember that we’re all J Cole fans here.\nComing in at number five is ‘Foldin Clothes’ from Cole’s 2016 album4 Your Eyez Only.Amassing the fewest streams on Spotify of any track on the album, it serves as a love letter to his wife, Melissa, during the time of her pregnancy.\nThe bass line is pleasant, akin to funk-inspired arrangements one would hear in a 1990s hip-hop track, and the electric guitar adds a nice bounce to the beat. However, the lyrics in this track appear to be written by ChatGPT. It’s almost as if this was a track written in jest and someone dared Jermaine to put it on the album. The concept is appreciated. The execution, not so much.\nIn hindsight, The Off Seasonwas a strong album. ‘Pride is the devil,’ with its janky piano tune, has a powerful message, and ‘My life’ blends Cole’s louder rapping with vocalist Morray’s smooth R&B sounds.\nIn comparison to these headline tracks, ‘100 mil’ is, dare I say it, lazy. Of course, there is value in repetition, ask any fan of techno music. But when that repetition takes up roughly 30% of the song, especially froman artist so precise as J Cole, questions over its quality are raised.\nJ Cole’s collaboration with Bas and Omen on ‘Bitchez’ starts off well. The combination of the brass horn and the snare drum makes for an enticing intro, and Cole’s verse after his fellow collaborators have their time on the mic is fluent in its execution.\nThe key element which makes this track one of the worst that Cole has produced is the chorus. There are whispers of what is to come at the beginning of the track, but not much could prepare you for a whiny version of Cole, who appears to have had multiple alcoholic drinks before recording. The tone is reminiscent of a bunch of frat guys who are full of braggadocio when, in reality, they don’t have much to show off. The high potential of this track is what disappoints me the most. It was one chorus away from being great.\nCombining some of the pitfalls that have hindered the success of other tracks in this list, ‘Neverland’ appears to have been made in order to fill a quota. The chorus is just a repetition of the title, and when Cole rounds it off with an extended “No” with a fluctuating pitch, there’s nothing to suggest to the listener that his heart was in it.\nThe flow is tentative, and the second verse is backed by some strange instrumental choices, almost as if there were two large ships slowly crashing into one another. Something as disastrous as this is just completely unexpected from someone with Cole’s calibre.\nThis is the second “nice” track on this list, but that is not the reason for its inclusion. Despite the uplifting piano, in a style that can be characterised as Cole’s attempt to inspire the young girls from fucked-up families, the track lacks just that: inspiration. Cole’s delivery is flat, most notably during the chorus, when he appears to wish to be anywhere other than the studio recording the track.\nThe composition of the track is also questionable, with the inclusion of a post-chorus usually reserved for pop music. In ‘Cheer Up’, its inclusion is strange as it doesn’t appear to add any value. Cole’s delivery of the line, “Don’t let them lil’ boy come but do some when they try push up,” is so unpolished that it’s hard to believe that it’s actually him rapping.\nThe track ends with 90 seconds of instrumental, which, for some musical pieces, allows the listener to take in what they’ve just heard. Here it seems they couldn’t be bothered to write any more lyrics but needed to fill some airtime to fulfil some contractual obligations.\nDigging deeper into how Cole could have put his name to something which falls so far below the standard that he has set for himself, it became apparent that this track was never mixed or mastered. Perhaps we can give him a pass this time as he has provided so much joy over the years. But we are begging you, please don’t play us like this again.",

        "title": "Top five greatest guest verses from Kendrick Lamar",
        "description": "Kendrick Lamaris an artist who needs no introduction, but we’ve written one anyway. The Compton-born megastar has already inserted himself into the conversation of the greatest rapper of all time due to his unique approach to flow, imperious taming of the art of lyricism with seamless control and use of technique.\nLamar started rapping in high school and released his debut albumSection.80in 2011. Ironically, his big break was gifted to him by Drake, as he opened on the Canadian’s Club Paradise tour; the same tour that introduced the wider community to ASAP Rocky. It didn’t take long for him to make his own way in the genre, though, releasing his second studio albumGood Kid, M.A.A.D Cityin 2012 to huge acclaim. It was all up from thereon.\nThe Californian rapper’s individual discography is one that any other artist would wish to have. He has 17 Grammys to his name, 13 of which are credited to his own tracks. It goes without saying that K Dot doesn’t need to feature on other artists’ tracks, but he does so anyway out of love for the game.\nHere are five of his greatest guest verses.\nThis song is Schoolboy Q’s love letter to weed with a fun, punchy and energetic delivery. Q and Kendrick started blowing up around the same time, and it feels like this was an opportunity for both of them to jump on a track and just have fun. Although Lamar is now a self-admitted teetotaler, he still manages to steal the show with his verse.\nKendrick bursts onto the song with some Spanish lyrics that sound romantic, but in translation leave little to the imagination. Clearly enjoying his newfound fame, he raps about partying and women like they’ll never run out, but brings his signature vibrance and lyricism that he is now known for.\nFollowing his song ‘ORANGE SODA’ blowing up on TikTok, Baby Keem became a modern overnight sensation. As he was starting his career, it was only right for big cousin K Dot to grab a verse on Keem’s hit single, aptly named ‘family ties’, to help push him in the right direction. The image released with the single even includes a family picture of a young Kendrick and an actualbabyKeem.\nAs the beat changes up to a heavier and darker flow, Lamar appears on the track. This beat change, synonymous with Kendrick’s discography, offers a nice contrast to his younger cousin’s contribution to the song and displays the master and apprentice dynamic of the pair. Though in the day of the internet, no one is safe, not even the Compton-born rapper. He was heavily meme’d for the accent he put on the lyrics “amazing, brother pop off, only on occasions, brother”.\nOn a random spring afternoon, Future & Metro Boomin woke up and decided they wanted all the violence. The pair released an album laced with sneak disses and even called itWE DON’T TRUST YOUto warn those mentioned in the release. Unnamed as a feature on the song, imagine the surprise when K Dot suddenly appeared on the beat. In fact, you don’t even have to imagine it. There are a ton of hilarious reaction videos online.\nThe verse is exactly what we’ve come to expect from the California rapper: an aggressive tone with amazing lyricism littered with references and amazing imagery. Technique is not what this appearance will be remembered for, though. Lamar’s verse on ‘Like That’ was the spark that lit the fire of his famousbeef with Drake, specifically calling out the Canadian rapper and J Cole in the line “motherfuck the big three, n-gga, it’s just big me.”\nTravis announced himself to the world with the success of his first mixtape,DAYS BEFORE RODEO,and debut studio albumRodeo.The hype was massive around Scott in 2016, and he capitalised on it by releasing his second studio album,Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. Kendrick was just coming off the success of one of the greatest rap albums of all time; 2015’sTo Pimp a Butterfly. It only made sense to get two of the most exciting young talents in the game on the same song.\nThe track has an eerie undertone, almost unnervingly creepy when the chorus fades off. Lamar understood the assignment perfectly and offered a poetic performance that pushed that vibe further with lyrics like “Peter Piper, picked a pepper so I could pick your brain and put your heart together”. The California native even delivers some vocals that hammer home the ominous feel of the song.\nAfter teasing the release of his seventh studio albumLife of Pablofor almost a year, Ye finally released it in 2016 to a mixed reception. Looking back, it’s an album that grows on you with time, but there were still certainly a couple of gems that were appreciated on its release. One of those shining examples was ‘No More Parties in LA’, which included a surprising feature from Kung Fu Kenny himself.\nKendrick’s verse is a real treat. As West begins the first verse, he’s suddenly interrupted by Lamar, who steals the first verse for himself. The feature is an unexpectedly long one from K Dot, which is just a further gift to fans who crave more of him. The lyrics and flow blend perfectly with Ye’s masterful production and beat, so it feels more like a Kendrick song than a Kanye song.",

        "title": "Five times De La Soul collaborated with Gorillaz",
        "description": "Gorillaz are well-known for their many hip-hop collaborations, but arguably, their most thrilling partners have beenDe La Soul. The virtual band, led by Damon Albarn, has worked with everyone from Mos Def and Snoop Dogg to ScHoolboy Q and Vince Staples over their two decades of making music.\nAs one of the most groundbreaking groups of the late ’80s and early ’90s, De La Soul have inspired generations of rappers through classic albums such as3 Feet High and RisingandDe La Soul Is Dead. But for many kids in the 2000s, the first time hearing Posdnuos, Maseo and Trugoy the Dove’s music will have been from the Blur frontman’s offspring.\nTheir collaborations began in 2005 and have continued over the years, working together as recently as 2023 on the latest Gorillaz album. Still, to this day, seeing De La Soul’s name on their albums provides a similar excitement for their creative chemistry.\nAlbarn recently announced that he’s finishing up a new Gorillaz album, set to be released in 2025. Despite the loss of Trugoy the Dove, hip-hop fans will be hoping another De La Soul track makes the cut.\nBelow, check out five captivating collaborations between De La Soul and Gorillaz.\nDe La Soul joined forces with Gorillaz for the first time in 2005, and the song remains their most popular record together. The classicDemon Daysalbum paved the way for ‘Feel Good Inc’, a certified hit that reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and 14 in the US. It’s easily the band’s biggest song, with almost two billion streams on Spotify.\nTrugoy the Dove steals the show on the track, kicking off his verse with the iconic lyrics, “Laughin’ gas, these hazmats, fast cats/ Linin’ ’em up like arse cracks/ Play these ponies at the track/ It’s my chocolate attack/ Shit, I’m steppin’ in the heart of this here/ Care Bear repping in harder this year/ Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!”\nGorillaz had the weight of the world on their shoulders following the successfulDemon Daysalbum, produced by Danger Mouse, which included hits like‘Dare’ and ‘Dirty Harry’. Hoping to keep that magic alive on 2010’sPlastic Beach, they teamed up with De La Soul again on ‘Superfast Jellyfish’, featuring Gruff Rhys, the lead singer of Super Furry Animals.\nPosdnuos’ lyricism was on display in this one, rapping, “All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers/ No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders/ ‘Don’t waste time’ with your net, our net worth is set/ Ready, go, many know others but/ We be the colours of the mad and the wicked/ We be bad, we re-brick it with the twenty-four hour sign.”\nSeven years afterPlastic Beach, Gorillaz welcomed a new collection of rappers on theirHumanzalbum, including Pusha T, Danny Brown, ScHoolboy Q and Vince Staples. But still, it wouldn’t have been a comeback without the trusty New York trio. De La Soul featured on ‘Momentz’, the fifth track on the album, despite Albarn initially trying to get Dave Chappelle on the record instead.\nRecognising the return, Posdnuos spits in his verse, “De La is also back again/ With a crew that’s bound to pack ’em in/ Got a girl who’s up for the matin’/ I sense the need in her grammar/ Her nose has never been skatin’/ But she’s sippin’ star constellation/ For real, her squirt game was so like 2Pac out of court run towards camera.”\nTrugoy the Dove passed away on February 12th, 2023. Two weeks later, Gorillaz paid the ultimate tribute by releasing ‘Crocadillaz’, a song for the deluxe version of theirCracker Islandalbum. Dave carries an infectious track that makes you wonder how it didn’t appear on the original tracklist in the first place.\nJamaican reggae singer Dawn Penn is also featured in the song, in which Trugoy raps, “Send the sentiment, taste the destruction/ Earth-level angles folded and tucked in/ Your four corners parade in seduction/ Pretty veneer boys, step to the rear/ I’ma play the chairman and step to the chair/ It’s the darling of it all, carving on the wall.”\nDespite not being an official collaboration between Gorillaz and De La Soul, the latter group recruited Albarn to feature onAnd the Anonymous Nobody, their 2016 album that served as their first LP in 12 years. Trugoy the Dove initially didn’t like the sound of ‘Here in After’, but his trumpet player helped change his mind.\nIn the end, the song played an important role in processing the loss of his cousin, who was like a best friend to him. “That song brought me to that place, to thinking about my cousin,” he toldSpin. “It brought me to thinking about my mum and my dad, who also passed. It was like, ‘Yeah, I’m feeling something here.’”",

        "description": "Tyler, the Creatoris one of the most exciting young minds in hip-hop, and since the early 2010s, Tyler, the Creator has been bringing us interesting, boundary-pushing music. FromGoblintoFlower Boy,the LA rapper has been challenging the status quo for years and hasn’t gone unnoticed. As one of the first members of Odd Future to garner mainstream attention, Tyler, the Creator, is Odd Future’s best-performing artist.\nBorn and raised in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Ladera Heights, Tyler the Creator was looked after solely by his mother. LA, akin to New York, was experiencing stagnation during the early 2010s. However, Odd Future (often stylised OFWGKTA) would soon put it to an end. Based primarily out of Los Angeles, Odd Future really burst onto the hip-hop scene in 2011. The collective’s distinct look came with a different sound. OFWGKTA were pioneering in the way they effortlessly fused LA Skate culture with hip-hop.\nOdd Future seamlessly married the two completely separate entities that, before, would have seemed incompatible. The skateboarding culture came through in how they dressed. They always had skateboards in their hands and Vans shoes on their feet. Furthermore, the crew wore skateboarding clothing brands, brightly coloured tees, and humorous sweatshirts, but somehow, they made it work with hip-hop.\nWith group projects such asRadical,The Odd Future TapeandThe Odd Future Tape Vol 2, the collective was unstoppable when at full throttle. However, when it came to members working on solo projects, only a handful of them managed to gather enough of a cult following while in the crew to sustain a solo career after the collective’s dissolution. Unsurprisingly, Tyler was one of them.\nTyler, Frank Ocean, and Earl Sweatshirt were the only members who successfully emerged from the crew as solo artists. However, theIGORcreator would be the standout artist, receiving vast amounts of critical acclaim for his ability to morph and integrate the sonics of hip-hop into other genres.\nWith his own festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, and an array of accolades, the Odd Future founder is still strong today.The surprise release ofCHROMAKOPIAin 2024 showed he can mobilise his fanbase quickly and doesn’t even have to put much effort into marketing his music, as fans rest assured that any project will be amazing.\nThe West Coast rapper has a lot of input into his albums and often produces many of the tracks. For his fifth studio album,IGOR, he showed his love for music by tracking down an extremely obscure sample from an English rock band. This made it blindingly obvious that the lyricist has an eclectic taste in music, but on one occasion, he managed to name his top five.\nDuring a segment for the Adobe MAX 2020 Creativity Conference, Tyler revealed Eminem’sThe Marshall Mathers LPis his number one album ever. However, he also expressed his love for Erykah Badu’sMama’s Gun, N.E.R.D.’sIn Search Of…and Pharrell’s 2006 debut projectIn My Mind. Although he didn’t name a fifth, he has previously shown a lot of love to Kanye West and A Tribe Called Quest as musical inspirations.\nThe appearance of Eminem on the list shocked many, as Tyler and Em were embroiled in a strange beef for years. During the 2010s, theFlower Boyrhymer expressed his disdain for Eminem’s 2010 projectRecoveryand various other albums, such asThe Marshall Mathers LP 2andRevival. Still, from his 2020 interview, it seems he has a deep appreciation for Eminem’s early material.",

        "description": "Carson rapperBaby Keemhas been teasing a new album for months, but fans have yet to hear a new project from the West Coast emcee. In 2023, the lyricist released a song featuring his close friend, Kendrick Lamar, entitled ‘Hillbillies.’ However, Keem let his fans know it wasn’t a single and wouldn’t be appearing on any future project. Keem has been quiet recently and hasn’t released a full-length studio album sinceThe Melodic Blue, which hit streaming platforms in 2021.\nStill, the West Coast emcee is an influential figure and has appeared at various evets over the years. In 2023, he headlined Tyler The Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival and last year he announced that hewill be releasing an album entitledChild With Wolves.Although his sophomore project is yet to materialise, his cult fanbase are still hopeful.\nThat said, Baby Keem still engages with the community and during an appearance onRap Packwith Carl Chery, the ‘Orange Soda’ lyricist opened up about some of his influences and spoke on his love for Kanye West.\nDelving into how he was influenced by West, Keem told Chery, “I didn’t know what it was at the time but hearingGraduationon the radio all the time I was like ‘Okay I’m getting tired of these songs now, let me go and find something myself.”\nHis exposure to Kanye’s third album,Graduation,led to baby Keem to West’s other bodies of work, and one that he loved was Ye’s 2008 hit project,808s & Heartbreak.Explaining this more, Keem continued, “Then I found808s[& Heartbreak]. I was like, ‘Whoa! this reminds me of the wintertime. This is the best winter ever!’ I think it had snowed in Vegas, and I was like, ‘This is the soundtrack to what’s going on right now.'”\nStill, Baby Keem didn’t just enjoy Kanye West’s 2000s bodies of work but also began enjoying his new material as the 2010s began. The fiirst Kanye album of the 2010s wasMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,and this hit a spot with the West Coast emcee.\nThe ‘Durag Activity’ rhymer explained how he loved the 2010 album, elaborating, “i remember gettingDark Twisted,and ‘All of The Lights’ that was my favourite songthat and ‘Amazing’, and ever since then those have been my favourite two Kanye Songs!”\nCarl Chery even asked Baby Keem if he had a favourite Kanye album. Still, the Carson native found it extremely tough to answer due to the sheer number of projects West has managed to release during his career. That said, he still had an answer to the question.\nWhile attempting to nail down his favourite album, the lyricist admitted, “That’s so tough, man! I think my most influential album would be808s & Heartbreak.But my favourite album could beMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.”\nHowever, he conceded that there is no final answer to that question, insisting, “It goes back and forth one day it will be808sand the next day it will beDark Twisted.There’s no wrong answer. That guy is a creative genius!”\nWhile Baby Keem is most probably still riding high from his cousin, Kendrick Lamar’s win over Drake last year, his loyal fans still await a new project. However, at least he has given a working title for the forthcoming project.",

        "title": "Phife Dawg’s favourite A Tribe Called Quest songs of all time",
        "description": "The late emcee Phife Dawg was one of the figures at the forefront of the New York collectiveA Tribe Called Quest. Comprised of Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and rapper Jarobi White, the crew’s jazz-infused work saw them establish a unique breakaway sound. Labelled initially as “progressive rap”, the subgenre and aesthetic would come to be known as jazz-hop by the late 1990s.\nThe ensemble’s creators, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg, were childhood friends who had grown up together in the St. Albans neighbourhood of Queens. Exploring themes surrounding Afrocentrism and The Five-Percent Nation that were arising in neo-soul and other areas of hip-hop the collective were looking at the African-American experience in a more holistic way than other prevalent acts at the time.\nThe four-piece outfit was recorded under many monikers, including Crush Connection and Quest. However, in 1988, they finally settled with A Tribe Called Quest. Appearing on underground records alongside acts such as Jungle Brothers, De La Soul and Roots, in 1989, the crew hired hip-hop’s gatekeeper Kool DJ Red Alert as their manager. With the kingpin of rap music as their manager, the crew gained popularity inNew York City and, before long, the entire East Coast.\nThe ensemble’s 1993 album Midnight Marauders is still regarded asa hip-hop classic, with its single ‘Electric Relaxation’among one of the best hip-hop tracks ever made. However, during a 2015 in-depth interview withVulturemagazine, a year before his tragic passing, Phife Dawg revealed some of his favourite Tribe songs of all time and explained his reasons for picking them respectively.\nPhife Dawg first selected a track from the collective’s 1990 debut project,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. The song ‘Footprints’ was song four of the 14-track body of work and received an official remix in 2015 featuring CeeLo Green when the group celebrated the album’s 25th anniversary.\nSpeaking about his minor involvement in their debut album and Q-Tip’s production on ‘Footprints’, Phife toldVulture,“I wasn’t at a lot of the sessions on the first album. There were a few I was there, but I can barely remember which ones they were. Lyrically, Q-Tip is pretty much genius on this one. And I love the Stevie Wonder sample, the way he flipped it and the drums.” For ‘Footprints’ Q-Tip sampled the 1976 Stevie Wonder song ‘Sir Duke’ as well as ‘Think Twice’ by Donald Byrd.\nThe New York emcee then proceeded to select a track from their iconic albumThe Low End Theoryand unveiled that for this 1991 project, the group really came together and he was heavily involved in its creation. ‘Check The Rhime’ was the lead single of the legendary album.\nSpeaking about the collective’s attitude when makingThe Low End Theory,Phife explained toVulturemagazine, “We were absolutely in the studio for this one. It just sounded like we were Siamese twins, we were so in tune. It sounded like Tip could finish off a sentence and vice versa, and that’s really what made Tribe Tribe. ‘Check the Rhime’ showcases A Tribe Called Quest for what we really are!”\n1993 was the year that A Tribe Called Quest really hit their stride and began to enter the hip-hop public consciousness. It saw the collective enter the top ten of the Billboard 200 for the first time, and the project’s second single, ‘Electric Relaxation’, has an extraordinary legacy. However, Phife Dawg didn’t choose the previously mentioned as one of his favourites but instead the track ‘Lyrics To Go’.\nSpeaking about the track sampled by Q-Tip for the song, Phife excitedly stated, “First of all, Minnie Riperton probably had the greatest voice that ever lived. Two, the way Q-Tip sampled this song [‘Inside My Love’] and was able to incorporate it with the drums, that was crazy. I wish I had been able to think of that!”\nThe 1996 fourth album from A Tribe Called Quest debuted straight at number one on the Billboard 200, and ‘Wordplay’ is one of Phife Dawg’s personal highlights. Not released as a single, the J Dilla-produced song was minimal and distinct from a Q-Tip beat, which Phife liked.\nSpeaking about the track, the lyricist toldVulture,“It’s a dope record because J Dilla is known for his drums, kicks, snares. The bass line is crazy. Most of the time, when I say that I like something, it’s usually because of the production and the bass line. [J Dilla] wasn’t at the actual session, but it was myself, Q-Tip, and Consequence, just being in the control room freestyling, and eventually writing, and then going in the booth and laying it down.”\nThe Love Movementwas the last album of A Tribe Called Quest’s run and saw them bow out with more beats from J Dilla and ‘Find A Way’ was released as the lead the single due to its sonic greatness.\nIn fact, Phife believed it was the most superior track they had ever recorded, stating, “J Dilla is just the man, period. I love the beat, the tempo, the bass line, and the way we made up our own hook and made everybody think that the lady was really saying that. That’s like my favourite Tribe record ever. Period.”",

        "title": "Top 5: The five best songs from hip-hop’s first golden age",
        "description": "Within hip-hop, there has been an age-long debate about the term “golden age” and what period it encapsulates. Many would apply this label to the 1990s due to the sheer amount of music and excitement that decade provided fans of the genre. However, vast amounts of crucial figures are insistent that the phrase only be used when referring to the ’80s because it was the decade during which the culture first found its legs.\nIt’s fair to say that irrespective of your generational preference concerning hip-hop, nobody would or could apply the term golden age to the 2000s. Rap music had blossomed by the turn of the millennium, and for vast swathes of rappers, the “golden age” refers to a time when the genre’s rules were still unwritten. By 1999, hip-hop had an identity that has since remained relatively fixed.\nOf course, it is natural that depending on your birth date, you are bound to have an affinity for specific eras and artists within the genre. That being said, from the perspective of a hip-hop purist, the “golden age” would undoubtedly stretchfrom 1979 to 1989.These were the culture’s formative years, so to speak. During this period, there was an abundance of experimentation and compelling material created through mere trial and error.\nAlthough a fair amount ofground was broken in the ’90s, many of the decade’s pioneers had their career beginnings firmly in the ’80s, making 1979 to 1989 unequivocally the “golden age”. In this article, we will do a deep dive into the legendary era to see if we can find the five best songs from hip-hop’s golden age.\nMan Parrish was a legendary producer and integral part of East Coast hip-hop in the early 1980s. Parrish helped create, define and develop the electro of the ’80s and undeniably helped push it to the masses. Parrish, along with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa, was a kingpin concerning the popularisation of electro. One of his most epic productions was ‘Boogie Down Bronx’.\nThe 1984 track features vocals from Cool Johnski of the Freeze Force Crew. ‘Boogie Down Bronx’ became a hit. Derived from the song, ‘Boogie’ has become a famous turn of phrase and a way to refer to the Bronx.\nLL Cool J was an iconic figure of hip-hop’s golden age. Although he didn’t start as a solo artist and was, in fact, part of The Extravagant 3, for LL, that was merely a launchpad into the higher échelons of rap. LL Cool J  is a certified New York legend and, along with other Queens acts such as Run-DMC, dominated the ’80s. As a solo act, LL worked with many talented individuals. However, his collaboration with Rick Rubin is what really catapulted him to the top.\n‘Rock The Bells’ was the third single from LL’s platinum-certified debut album,Radio.Executively produced by Rick Rubin,Radiowas one of the most impactful projects of the ’80s. The single had the impact of electro, utilised the scratch, yet had the bounce of the late ’70s. The track was not electro, yet it still managed to effectively use the electronic drum machine. The track was Rick Rubin’s take on the 1982 song ‘Breaking Bells’ by Crash Crew and has stood the test of time as a hip-hop classic.\nThis track was iconic when it was put out and is widely considered the first hip-hop record ever. The song was released in 1979, making it one of the only rap songs to be produced and recorded in the same year as DJ Cool Herc’s Sedgewick Avenue block party. The track samples ‘Good Times’ by Nile Rodger’s band Chic and was one of the first hip-hop to enter the US charts. ‘Rapper’s Delight’ entered the top 40 in America, reaching the top three in the United Kingdom and even number one in Canada.\nAkin to Dr Dre’sThe Chronic,‘Rapper’s Delight’ has been archived in the Library of Congress and has been preserved as a culturally significant artefact. Although the single has received much critical acclaim, many take issue with the song as the group is somewhat of a façade. Many have declared that the name “Sugar Hill Gang” was purposefully misleading as (curated by Sylvia Robinson) not one individual from the group from the Sugar Hill area of Harlem. It has since become common knowledge that the collective is from Englewood, New Jersey. However, the song has still maintained its legendary status.\nThis track had to be on the list because it was the first of its kind. Before the release of ‘The Message’, there had never been a politically charged hip-hop song. This single, rapped by Melle Mel and produced by Clifton “Jiggs” Chase of Sugarhill Records, was the track that sparked the idea of hip-hop as a vehicle for social change. If it was not for this 1982 record, there would have been no Public Enemy. Political hip-hop was non-existent in 1982, and ‘The Message’ was pioneering in every possible way.\nFurious Five member Melle Mel has explained previously how, initially, ‘The Message’ was a track nobody wanted to record. The golden age artist explained that he only recorded the track because Sylvia Robinson of Sugarhill Records begged him to. He and his crew thought nothing of it and assumed it would go nowhere, but they were wrong. That summer, everybody in New York was blasting ‘The Message’, and it has been a cultural milestone ever since.\nEric B & Rakim completely changed the game with their 1987 album,Paid In Full. Rakim showed a level of complexity in his rapping that many had never heard before. En masse, lyricists cite Rakim as the first MC to break out of the genre’s rigid mould concerning rhyme schemes. In its early stages, hip-hop artists delivered basic raps and rhymes with funky intonations. However, the style was growing tired by the latter stages of the ’80s. Rakim is said to be a lyrical pioneer, and when this track was released, it set a precedent and effectively changed the course of lyricism in hip-hop.\nHowever, Rakim was only one-half of the duo. The track itself was produced by Eric B and contained several samples. Still, the most famous and intriguing selection is his use of the Israeli singer Ofra Haza’s vocals from her track ‘Im Nin’alu’. Outside of the electro subgenre, hip-hop struggled to broaden its horizons concerning sampling. Mostly interpolating funk from the 1960s and ’70s, the culture was hesitant to let go of its funky origins and identify more abstract samples. Eric B successfully advanced the culture production-wise.",

        "title": "Top 5: The five best Swizz Beatz instrumentals of all time",
        "description": "Swizz Beatzgrew up in the Bronx during the 1980s, immersed in a musical environment and, thanks to his family’s involvement in music management, he would later become a legend. His father, Terrence, came from a lineage of entrepreneurs, and in the late ’80s, the family decided to start their own production company and label—the iconic Ruff Ryders Entertainment.\nBased in the Bronx,Ruff Ryders Entertainmentemerged as a production company that offered artist management, booking services, an in-house studio, and a resident producer. Surrounded by music in the vibrant hip-hop scene of the ’80s, the beatmaker initially started his journey as a DJ. However, faced with a crowded market and realising he had access to equipment from his family, he soon shifted gears from DJing to focus on music production.\nBefore too long, Swizz had started to carve out a name for himself in the Bronx. With excitement growing around him, his uncle, the iconic record executive Joaquin ‘Waah’ Dean, appointed him as the company’s resident producer. Shortly after, he was working with thelikes of DMX, Eve and even The Lox— still, this was only the beginning.\nSince launching his career in the mid-’90s, Swizz Beatz has built an impressive portfolio over the past thirty years, contributing to producing more than 160 albums, encompassing studio projects, compilations, mixtapes, and even soundtracks. He has produced some great instrumentals but we have compiled a list of his five best of all time.\nThis beat is an interesting yet simple example of East Coast hip-hop in the 1990s. With its prominent horn section and minimalistic drum loop making it an extremely sparse arrangement, it gave a lot of space for Noreaga and those featured to deliver their verses.\nHowever, this song and instrumental is merely the intro of another unreleased beat. In aDrink Champsinterview, Swizz Beatz revealed he was unhappy with NORE for taking the beat and stated, “‘Banned From TV’ is the intro to the beat that was made. They didn’t even wanna get to the beat. I was like, ‘Let’s get to the other [part of the] beat, they just ignored me the whole time.”\nUnlike many of Swizz Beatz instrumentals, this track from Jay-Z’sBlueprint 3featured multiple samples from the 2007 track ‘D.A.N.C.E’ by the EDM duo Justice. Like many of the musician’s beats, ‘On To The Next One’ has a four-bar switch with some very dark sounds, making it highly eerie.\nThe sample is almost used in place of percussion as it provides the bulk of the track’s momentum and it is impossible to say the song itself is not catchy. It was one of the album’s highlights and was aJay-Z’s warmpup for 2011’sWatch The Throne.\n‘I Can Transform Ya’ is an instantly recognisable Swizz Beatz production. The Bronx producer had a certain sonic in his early days, using many guitars and simple melodies. However, in the 2000s, he began producing more industrial-sounding beats. Chris Brown’s ‘I Can Transform Ya’ is an example of this.\nWith its aggressive synth-driven melody with flurries of distorted electric guitars, this bass-heavy track was a single from Chris Brown’s third studio album,Graffiti,and was a double platinum single. It also features a verse from legendary Young Money emcee Lil Wayne.\n‘Party Up (Up in Here)’ is a classic DMX track and was released as the second single from his third studio album. With a classic Swizz Beatz whistle in there to add energy to the beat, the Bronx beatmaker serves an infectious symphony of electronic horns, and upon closer listening, even the faint sound of a crowd runs throughout the instrumental.\nPerRolling Stone,DMX didn’t want to finish the song and Swizz forced him. Explaining this, he told the publication, “I mean, it worked for DMX one time with ‘Party Up.’ But if you listen to ‘Party Up,’ he does everything against the track. Like you could tell he didn’t want to do the song. But I forced him because we was on a deadline. It’s the most disrespectful verse I think he ever did, and it’s the biggest song we ever made.”\n‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ was the world’s introduction to DMX, and Swizz Beatz knocked it out the park. Featuring as the lead single on his first ever albumIt’s Dark and Hell Is Hot,the simple beat was led a number one project.\nThe inspiration for Ruff Ryders Anthem came from Swizz’s time in Atlanta. Recalling what he was trying to emulate, the Bronx native he told BET, “‘Ruff Ryder’s Anthem’ came kinda organically it was a sound that I made while I was in Atlanta. I was looking, and I’m seeing these pep rallies and the different games and things I was going to. They had the marching bands and these different  particular chants, and I was like, ‘Man, I wanna bring that energy into music!’”",

His decades-spanning career has seen him produce tracks for the likes of Mobb Deep, Nas, Jadakiss and Ghostface Killah, to releasing collaborative albums with rappers such as Freddie Gibbs, Curren$y, Roc Marciano, Larry June and Earl Sweatshirt.\n2024 was a massive year for the producer, having inadvertently involved himself in the Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake beef after producing the menacing ‘Meet the Grahams‘. This came after only producing ‘Wick Man’ for Drizzy’sFor All the Dogs: Scary Hours Editionin 2023.\nA collection of Alchemist’s best work wouldn’t be complete without including the late Prodigy and Evidence, whom he met during the early stages of his career and still collaborates with.\n“I’ve been able to have a lot of waves in this game,” he toldNo Bellsin an interview last year. “As a producer, you’re able to do that, maybe more than an artist. You’ve just gotta keep your ears and eyes open and be welcoming to the next shit.”\nHe continued, “I remember when I first saw MIKE. I remember when I first saw Wiki. I can name a bunch of other things, too. It was like, ‘That’s dope,’ and there’s things there I can learn. Patterns, styles. I learn from all my young homies, and that’s always a blessing.”\nAlchemist’s career might not be what it is today without some legendary beatmakers inspiring him. He once toldGeniusthat DJ Premier, Dr Dre, DJ Muggs, Large Professor and Q-Tip were his top five producers.\nHe called Premier his “illegitimate father” and Dr Dre the “pinnacle of sound,” while crediting Muggs’ “beautiful mess.” He also said Professor “personified all the elements of rap” and described Tip as “the master.” After listing his favourites, he also gave a late mention to Madlib, calling him his “number one inspiration.”\n2025 is looking to be another year for the books. In February, he released his collaborative album with 2 Chainz and Larry June,Life Is Beautiful, before dropping hisMixed Fruit Vol 1: Pineapple Gingerproject in May. His much-anticipatedForensicsalbum with Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def) is also scheduled to arrive.\nCheck out our playlist of Alchemist’s 25 best beats below for a glimpse at his illustrious career.",

        "description": "Aship hopshot into the stream of public consciousness and commercial success in the 1990s, there became two clearly defined headquarters for the genre that were producing the majority of the artists: California and New York. As this became apparent, the two states started competing with each other, which birthed the East Coast-West Coast rivalry.\nTwo rappers became the faces of the rivalry and almost the designated leaders of their respective locations: East Coast-based artist Biggie and West Coast-based rapper Tupac. Even their record labels were beefing as there was no love lost between New York’s Bad Boy Records and Los Angeles’s Death Row Records.\nThe feud came to a violent and tragic pinnacle in a six-month period in 1996 and 1997 that saw both Biggie and Tupac lose their lives to the feud, both dying in drive-by shootings. This loss of two of the brightest young talents that rap had to offer was a sobering conclusion to the rivalry. The battle formally ended with a peace summit in 1997 on the orders of Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader.\nWhat was interesting about the competition was that it shouldn’t have been a contest in the first place. New York had five of its massive boroughs producing a lot of talent: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island, and The Bronx. LA only had two: the Bay Area and, of course, Compton. This was especially poignant considering Compton’s population is in the 90,000s, completely dwarfed by the likes of Manhattan’s 1.6million.\nThe fact that Compton still held its own in the face of the giants of New York is ridiculous, but when you consider some of the artists that the little city has produced, it makes sense that it’s regarded as a rap Mecca.\nThese names include NWA, Kendrick Lamar, The Game, Suge Knight, and Vince Staples; the list goes on and on. With such a legacy of talent, the discography on offer is any rap fan’s dream.\nWe’d be remiss if the first song mentioned wasn’t the aptly titled ‘Straight Outta Compton’, the iconic debut single by legendary rap outfit NWA that thrust them into the spotlight. The title, combined with the aggressive lyrics and punchy delivery, let everyone know what Compton was about.\nThe street of the city could be lined with gold considering the amount of Grammys that home-grown talentKendrick Lamarhas brought back with him. Somehow, he didn’t win one for the perfectly harnessed chaotic energy of ‘M.A.A.D City’. This track brings the dark underbelly of Compton to the foreground and discusses in poetic detail the harrowing experience of living in the gang-run city.\nCoolio killed it with his track ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’. He, too, details in detail what living life on the hard streets of Compton was like and the man it moulded him into. The heavy beat, complemented by Coolio’s discussions of death lurking around every corner, is truly impactful.\nThe range of tracks that have come straight out of Compton is as diverse as they are entertaining. Hip-hop wouldn’t be where it is today without Compton and all of its success stories. We have therefore created a playlist to help in your rap history education.",

        "title": "The 25 most essential underground California hits of all time",
        "description": "The genre ofhip-hop, without question, began on America’s East Coast in the Bronx borough of New York City. However, as the genre began to spread across the nation, the people of California took it and made it their own. They would talk about life on the West Coast, LA gangs, and lowriders and make it a little funkier.\nBut the West Coast is too often associated with G-funk, Death Row, and Dr. Dre. Although it is impossible to deny the impact that Dr Dre and Death Row Records had on hip-hop culture, California has produced a wide array of different MCs over the years, and not all of them adopted the G-funk sound.\nDespite the obvious commercial viability of G-funk and its immense popularity, many lyricists and hip-hop purists in California chose to keep a more New York sound. Others, especially in Oakland, ended up in the Hyphy scene, and some forged ahead with more experimental productions of their own. That said, while Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre topped the charts with their distinct and renowned sound, other West Coast artists continued to make music. Unfortunately, they remained under the radar for the entirety of their careers. Some briefly crossed over, but for the most part, the California underground was jam-packed with talent that remained in the shadow of Dr Dre.\nOf course, Death Row wasn’t the only California-based record label that entered the mainstream during the 1990s, and it would be foolish to ignore labels such as  Sick Wid It and Bust It Records. However, there were other artists not on either of these labels who made waves in the underground. Many artists cite Ras Kass as an unbelievable emcee who doesn’t get his flowers. Furthermore, Eminem fans have seen him indirectly praise the San Francisco lyricist Paris.\nThere are a slew of California groups and artists akin to De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest who decided to ditch the funk and experiment with jazz. However, the epicentre of this movement was on the East Coast. As such, many of the avant-garde groups on the West Coast were getting little to no recognition on a national level. The LA and Oakland underground were undeniably thriving more than the South’s in the 1990s, but artists and groups such as Del The Funky Homosapien (Ice Cube’s cousin), Styles of Beyond and Aceyalone are underappreciated.\nThe overall output of the West Coast is arguably better than the East’s, especially during the ‘90s, and many would say Kendrick Lamar is the ultimate culmination of California’s rich musical history. Still, many of the MCs who made the most essential underground anthems of all time are, to this day, unknown, unrecognised and unheard.",

        "description": "J Dilla’slegacy is one of a mysterious figure who created pure magic and hip-hop history from a dingy basement studio in Detroit. The late producer and emcee worked with several acts during his career. However, his impact on the culture was profound.\nJ Dilla produced for The Roots, Common, Erykah Badu and many other artists in the 1990s and revived people’s love for soul and jazz with his samples and, as hip-hop production became more robotic, managed to humanise music withhis unique beat-making style.\nDilla (real name James Yancey)was an official member of Slum Villageand gained tremendous attention with his production style, which countered the gritty sound of New York with a smooth, soul-inspired sound that was heavenly.\nYancey is known for his ingenious way of utilising the MPC 3000, a piece of technology that led hip-hop instrumentals to become highly stiff, mechanical, and too perfect regarding timings. Yancey found beauty in the imperfections that humans brought to music—the slightly offbeat hit off a snare, the erratic movement that percussionists intuitively provide. As such, with his purposefully wonky drums and haphazard approach to sampling, Yancey gave his machine a soul.\nIn a 2006 documentary on J Dilla’s career and life, Chicago rapper Common referred to him as an “esoteric spirit” who came down to earth and returned to heaven. However, his most significant gift to hip-hop while he was on earth wasDonuts, an entirely instrumental project widely considered his magnum opus.\nIn 2002, Yancey was diagnosed with a dreadful illness. Suffering from thrombocytopenic purpura combined with lupus, J Dilla was hospitalised and told that his body was turning on itself and destroying his organs. As such, he was hospitalised. However, wheelchair-bound and dying, the Detroit native began working on a final album.\n29 of the album’s 31 tracks were made in his hospital room, and its chaotic yet beautiful arrangement was perceived by many as Yancey’s way of musically confronting death and the notion of an afterlife. Following its release in 2006, fans were made aware that some of the album’s closing tracks were made days before the musician began palliative care in preparation for death.\nJ Dilla used a range of samples forDonuts, but some iconic songs he sampled more than once although listeners would never be able to tell. From soul to electro and jazz, some tracks were the backbone of the project. Below, you can see some of the samples that madeDonuts.",

        "title": "A playlist of the best songs sampled by Wu-Tang Clan",
        "description": "Wu-Tang Clanwas a staple of hip-hop in the 1990s and one of many mega-crews that emerged in the culture during that period. Thanks to RZA’s ingenuity, the sound of the Staten Island collective was gritty, raw, and unpolished.\nRZA presided over iconic projects such asEnter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), GZA’sLiquid Swordsand Raekwon’sOnly Built 4 Cuban Linx…the beatmaker was the mastermind behind several platinum-selling albums.\nWith pure ingenuity, RZA brought a lo-fi production style that he skillfully fused with a grimy and abrasive edge. This sonic would become the Clan’s calling card. The slightly underproduced grit and imperfection it provided, sonically, reflected the streets in a way the professionally cleaned-up and polished rap albums didn’t.\nFrom the reasonably desolate New York City borough of Staten Island and operating from the basement of his mother’s house to the top of the charts, RZA’s instrumentals became seminal hits.Whether it’s ‘C.R.E.A.M’ or ‘Protect Ya Neck’,his production was lauded for his creative use of samples.\nSometimes, when producers sample, it’s extremely obvious which song has been used. Within hip-hop, there has been a propensity to use a copy-and-paste formula. Not only is it an uninspired way to make music, but it also leaves the listener feeling like they are listening to a mere remix of the original.\nSome beatmakers are unbelievably shrewd in how they can hide and blend the samples they use. Sometimes, the songs are hidden with the instrumental so well listeners aren’t even aware one is there.\nThat said, RZA was among one of the best sample selecters in hip-hop. The crew’s most famous single ‘C.R.E.A.M’ sampled the intro of the 1967 song ‘As Long as I’ve Got You’ by The Charmels, a Memphis female quartet. The piano melody has since become synonymous with the Clan.\nThe crew’s other breakout hit ‘Protect Ya Neck’ sampled not just one but four different songs. Including the legendary 1970 funk piece, ‘The Grunt’ by The JB’s, ‘Cowboys To Girls’ by The Intruders, a repurposed portion of GZA’s ‘Words of A Genius’ and even LL Cool J’s 1985 smash ‘Rock The Bells’.\nThe sheer number of samples in ‘Protect Ya Neck’ should have made creating a coherent beat impossible. However, RZA managed to arrange the instrumental in a way that made perfect sense and iconic to listeners. From funk to Motown and, in true Wu-Tang Fashion, samples of Kung-Fu movies, anything that could be used to create music, the collective utilised it and made magic in the process.\nThe success of RZA’s production made other East Coast beatmakers unafraid to start using more detuned, less harmonic samples to restore the sound of what was initially a street-born, heavy-hitting, rebellious and sonically creative culture.\nBelow, you can see all the tracks that perked RZA’s ears up while he was digging through the crates in the late 1980s and early ’90s. Furthermore, you can see how he adapted them to create masterpieces, which are still listened to today.",

        "description": "Pop Smoke’scareer was unfairly cut short in 2020 when he was murdered in LA. Following tracks such as ‘Diro’ and ‘Welcome To The Party’, the Brooklyn drill artist gave rise to a new wave of New York MCs and immediately cut through to the mainstream.\nAlthoughhe was heavily influenced by UK drilland even worked with some of the subgenres producers such as 808Melo and AXL beats, the lyricist made it palatable to an American audience and quickly became a pioneer of sorts.\nMany other musicians, such as Bobby Shmurda, Fivio Foreign and 22Gz,helped popularise the sound in Brooklynduring the Mid-2010s. However, Pop Smoke’s rise to fame was a monumental moment for the genre and the tipping point which effectively led to drill becoming the de facto sound of New York.\nSince then, figures such as Moneybagg Yo and Pooh Shiesty have achieved an unfathomable amount of notoriety using the sound. That said, in 2020, Pop Smoke sat down with Annie Mac to speak about his favourite tracks for a party.\nMuch to the surprise of many, the New Yorker revealed that he was a fan of Coldplay, specifically their track ‘Arabseque’. The downtempo track is a far cry from drill. With some verses sung in French, it was an unusual pick from the emcee.\nHowever, concerning British rock bands, Pop Smoke made it clear he was a fan, naming bands such as Bombay Bicycle Club and Sports Team, as well as the singer Jacob Collier and the EDM duo Prospa.\nAlthough Mac asked him to name his best songs for a party, the rhymer only named a few hip-hop tracks and, aside from three of his own, Pop Smoke highlighted Pa Salieu, 50 Cent, Travis Scott, Future and Louisiana emcee Juvenile.\nDespite Pop Smoke’s seismic impact on the New York hip-hop scene, some older figures have asserted that his success was to the city’s detriment. During an interview last year, G-Unit legend Tony Yayo detailed how, although Pop’s rise was good for New York, it also led to more crime, revealing, “Now, New York is worse than Chicago, And California, with the drill, because n*ggas is throwing like n*ggas dead friends in there.”\nHe concluded, “When we had battle raps with Ja Rule and them, n*ggas was still alive. But there’s no remorse with the drill music. N*ggas shooting little kids.” You can see Pop Smoke’s ultimate party playlist below.",

        "description": "The 2000s produced some incredible hip-hop talents, many of whom have become multi-millionaires and exceptional entrepreneurs, andLil Wayne’slegacy is undoubtedly as one of those artists. The New Orleans star has been one of the most influential rappers and is an integral figure in the rise in popularity of Southern rap.\nHis catalogue is unbelievably eclectic, having released over 29 mixtapes and 14 studio albums, and his business credentials are not insignificant. As a lyricist and music executive, he has been highly successful and is responsible for many of the stars we see on the charts today.\nHis Young Money imprint gave a platform to a range of artists. From Drake to Nicki Minaj and Tyga as the face of Bridman’s Cash Money and the founder of Young Money, he has profoundly impacted hip-hop since his emergence at the turn of the millennium.\nAs a youngster, Lil Wayne grew up on a range of different kinds of music. Althoughhe grew up in the south,he loved music from other parts of the US. From Death Row on the West Coast to Roc-a-Fella on the East Coast, Wayne paid attention to these movements and listened to the artists to hone his skills as a lyricist.\nWhile he was growing up, he also listened to southern artists. From Geto Boys and UGK to Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG. However, from Lil Wayne’s mixtape releases, it is evident that he had a love for all sorts of subgenres of hip-hop.\nDuring the early 2000s, when working with DJ Drama for hisDedicationmixtape series, Wayne covered various songs. On his 2006 mixtapeDedication 2,Wayne rapped over East Coast instrumentals such as The Diplomats’ ‘Get From Round Me’ and Jay-Z’s ‘The Game Iz Mine’.\nDuring a 2019 interview with DJ Khaled on his exclusive Amazon podcast,The First One,Lil Wayne spoke about some of the artists that inspired him in the game, and some of his picks were undeniably fascinating.\nTwo unsurprising picks were Brooklyn legends Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls; however, remaining in New York, he also picked Cam’ron, telling Khaled, “I was the biggest Cam fan.” He also selected female emcee and icon Missy Elliott, stating, “Missy Elliott — that was my favourite rapperbecause that would be why I was making so many sounds. You know, Missy was into the whole ‘Brrrrt’ [sound]. You know what I mean? She’s about to make the ‘hehehehe ha’ [sound].”\nHowever, he also revealed that he loved the Noreaga (N.O.R.E.), the host ofDrink Champs,explaining, “I was the hugest N.O.R.E. fan,” adding, “He had this thing about him where he could be from anywhere, and you fucked with him.”\nWayne’s choices were interesting, to say the least. Thereby, we have compiled what Wayne would undoubtedly consider the ultimate playlist of all time, featuring only his favourite MCs and their best work.",

        "description": "When we’re talking abouthip-hopsubgenres, there are so many to choose from. Each has a different tone and texture, and subgenres can form in several ways and have a rich history. In fact, some become so far removed from their predecessors that they become new genres in their own right. However, sometimes subgenres arise due to lyrical content and occasionally even lyrical delivery. An example of this is conscious rap.\nOver the years, many different subgenres and terms have been created within hip-hop due to lyrical content. When the genre was first created, almost all records were made with the intention of making its listeners dance with lyrics about parties, dancing, positivity and more.\nHowever, that changed upon the release of‘The Message’ by Grandmaster Flashand The Furious Five. This track’s lyrical content was more realistic than optimistic about the predicament of African Americans and was very politically charged. Slowly but surely, more people began to make music like this.\nOther acts began to make hip-hop with a similar tone. As it developed, many came up with different names for it; some labelled it as political rap because it addressed political issues, and others marked it as activist rap because it seemed to be made by social activists. Still, over the years, it came to be known as conscious rap.\nIt was labelled so because those who made it were evidently aware and conscious of social and political issues, whereas many were oblivious to them.Consequentially, it came to be known as conscious rap.\nOther kinds of rap have emerged and prospered since, such as gangster rap, mafioso rap and mumble rap. However, conscious rap remains suppressed. Many have questioned why educated, conscious rappers who promote change are not supported to the same extent as gangster rappers by major record labels, but to no avail.\nIrrespective of whether or not they are currently held in the same regard as mumble rappers, conscious rappers are a massive part of hip-hop culture, and if they were not present, hip-hop would see an uncomfortable void so as a tribute to conscious rap, we have created the playlist for conscious rap newbies.",

        "description": "Jay-Z’sone of the wealthiest men in hip-hop. He has been putting out music consistently since the 1990s, and as a well-connected Brooklyn rapper, the ‘Dead Presidents’ musician has been around hip-hop since he was a teenager in the 1980s. In 2019, Jay-Z became the first artist from the genre to achieve billionaire status.\nAs a result, the rapper (real name Shawn Carter) is considered one of the best rappers of all time and is revered as somewhat of a god within the culture,with a business portfolio like no other emcee.\nBorn and raised in the infamously poor Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn, Jay-Z grew up in the ’80s. During this period,Brooklyn was a musical hotspot. As New York entered the 1990s, the borough became more musically active than the Bronx, to the surprise of many.\nAlthough the culture originated in the Bronx, it is fair to say that in New York, the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens have arguably produced the biggest legends over time, including Nas and Ol’ Dirty Bastard.\nJay-Z has previously admitted that he looked up to local MCs such as Biggie Smalls, Jaz-O, and Big Daddy Kane as an adolescent. However, over a decade later, when asked about his favourite emcees on the LA radio showThe Neighbourhoodwith host Big Boy, Carter responded, “I got the usual suspects – Biggie, Pac, Scarface, Eminem and Andre 3000. Off the top of my head, that would be my top five.”\nThat said, nearly a decade later, when he became the first hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame, the Bed-Stuy lyricist paid homage to over one hundred other rap acts who inspired him on his journey.\nDuring his speech, Jay-Z didn’t just name old-school classic acts but also spoke about newer artists who have given him drive over the years, including the likes of Travis Scott and J Cole. Below, you can see a playlist of tracks from 100 artists Jay mentioned.",
