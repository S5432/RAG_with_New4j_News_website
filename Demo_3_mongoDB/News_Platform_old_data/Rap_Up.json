On Saturday (Jan. 4), the South African pop star clapped back at a fan who responded negatively to her most recent photos on the app formerly known as Twitter.\nIn her initial post, she shared beach pictures with the caption, “Lookin like a tourist in my country,” to which a user responded, “Tyla why don't you just walk naked in public, seems like you hate clothes.” She replied, “You want me to wear a onesie on the beach? Stfu.” The fan came back after saying sorry but users on social media quickly dogpiled against the naysayer, questioning why he would give her a hard time because she wore a bikini with a cover up on the beach.",

        "description": "BYAhmad Davis/ 1.4.2025\nDrakeand LeBron James have a highly public kinship that has seemingly strained since James attended Kendrick Lamar’s Juneteenth concert,The Pop Out: Ken & Friends. Drake’s recently leaked “Fighting Irish Freestyle” has bars fans use to find the crux of the issue between the two former friends.\nOn Friday (Jan. 3), acclaimed producer Conductor Williams released anow-deleted videoon his YouTube channel that quickly made its rounds on social media. During the track, the “Knife Talk” rapper exclaimed, “The world fell in love with the gimmicks, even my brothers got tickets/ Seemed like they loved every minute/ Just know this s**t is personal to us, and it wasn't just business.” Fans suspect this line was directed at James andDemar DeRozanshowing up to The Pop Out.\nLater in the song he spit, “'Member we tradin' watches? I gave you that Arabic dial, you gave me a numbered edition/ You would even check up on my son like a pediatrician/ Sure convinced the gang this s**t was rooted in love when it isn't.” Shortly after, he said, “Talkin' 'bout we family, well, I'm not the cousin to visit/ God forbid we ever got to tarnish your public image/ All that brother talk as if I really discovered a sibling/ Six degrees, my memory's retrivin' our humble beginnings.”\nThese lines were seemingly attached to his relationship with James, who he even has tattooed on his arm. The tattoo features a picture of the NBA champion wearing his high school jersey from St. Vincent-St. Mary’s Fighting Irish, with James’ signature No. 23. When discussing the alleged diss track, radio personality Bootleg Kev stated, “Drake dissed LeBron James, a man whom which he tattooed a portrait on his arm. You can’t make this s**t up. Aubrey has turned into a professional victim I swear.”",

On Friday (Jan. 3),Billboardreported, “Nicki Minaj has been sued for assault by a man who claims the rapper physically attacked him following a concert in Detroit last April, according to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.”\nThe lawsuit asserted that her former manager, Brandon Garrett, claimed that Minaj attacked him, hitting him multiple times backstage on April 21, after he had another tour employee grab her prescription on his behalf. After finding out, Garrett stated that Minaj responded, “Are you f**king crazy having him pick up my prescription? You have lost your f**king mind and if my husband was here, he would knock out your f**king teeth. You’re a dead man walking. You just f**ked up your whole life and you will never be anyone, I’ll make sure of it.”\nThe complaint further noted that Minaj “open-handedly struck” Garrett on his face and wrist before ordering him out the room. Shortly after, Garrett claimed he locked himself in the bathroom for hours before receiving a text claiming that he would not be able to take the tour bus from Detroit to Chicago. After taking a flight to the next tour stop, he immediately contacted Chicago Police Department for a police escort exclaiming, “He feared for his safety and did not know if his belongings had been removed or tampered with.”",

He spent eight months in jail and wasreleased in December 2022after entering an Alford plea.”\nAnAlford pleais an agreement where a defendant acknowledges the evidence against them while maintaining their innocence. “Gunna's plea could not and was not used at Thug's trial, and he was never even named as a witness,” the legal professional explained. “He received a five-year suspended sentence with no reporting, no travel restrictions, no living restrictions, and no probation.”",

At one point, he was even developing one inspired by 2014’s “Only One,” though the project — like many of the Chicago native’s earlier efforts — was eventually shelved.

Taking to hisInstagram Stories, the Harlem native shared a meme of former NBA player Jeff Teague smirking while holding up his phone.\nAttorneys for the rapper-turned-podcaster have since slammed EPD for releasing details surrounding the case. \"The allegations against Mr. Budden are a minor charge, not even resulting in an arrest. A charge Mr. Budden is looking forward to beating in court on the merits, not in the press,” Nima Ameri toldTMZ. “The Chief's comments are reckless and, in our opinion, racially motivated.”\nAmeri further explained, “Our research has not shown a single press release on a disorderly person charge on the police website this year. His choice to single out Mr. Budden in our opinion is self-motivated and based off of Mr. Budden’s race andcelebrity status.\"\nEarlier in the month, the “Joe Budden Podcast” returned to co-host Parks Vallely’s basement, leaving many to assume the rapper was actually forced out of their previous studio. “I just sleptwalked somewhere I shouldn’t have sleptwalked,” he hinted at the legal ordeal during episode 786. “Nobody could go through this stuff but me. It’s only me. So you gotta deal with what comes with that. You would’ve never guessed it.”",

I don’t [have] my clothes on yet. So y’all basically see me naked.”\n“Y’all [are] not giving me a second to get dressed. Before I could dress the song up, y’all judge it,” Lil Uzi Vert further emphasized. Of course, when it came time to choose, they simply describedleaksas “horrible”: “It’s not even a over or underrated.”",

On Wednesday (Jan. 8), the “Surprise” singer joined Scott Mills and Derrick Johnson on “The Breakfast Club” to talk about the forthcoming NAACP Image Awards. However, the sit-down took an admittedly awkward turn when she was asked about her rumored romance with Burna Boy.\nAbout halfway through the interview, guest host Loren LoRosa asked Chlöe if she’d be bringing a date to the ceremony, which airs on Feb. 22 via BET and CBS. The songstress responded, “My godmom and my manager,” followed by her being questioned about whether Burna Boy would be there. “You’ll have to ask him,” she replied.\n“You’re here, he’s not,” LoRosa shot back before bringing upfootage of the two artiststogether in Nigeria in December 2024. Chlöe, reasonably trying to steer the conversation elsewhere, shared, “Nigeria was so beautiful. I had the best time. I had some good food. I had pepper soup. I had lots of spicy chicken. Really good.”\nUnfortunately, the detour didn’t last long, with Charlamagne Tha God evidently growing impatient with all the beating around the bush. “We want to know, is that your boo?” LoRosa asked directly, to which Chlöe politely answered, “Well, I’m a grown woman. I had a great time in Nigeria.” She noted, “He’s a grown man, just like I’m a grown woman.”",

Craig responded to the claims by sharing screenshots from his account messages without any responses from him, arguing that she is looking for clout.\nOne social media user replied to Elizabeth’s post exposing the baller, stating, “Megan let another n**ga named Torrey shoot his shot and look at the outcome. She really shot herself in the foot with this one.” Another user said, “Y’all b**ches really be lame AF because it was no reason for you to post this but to get clout. Megan seriously deserves better.” Someone else stated, “We all knew they been talking or whatever but you wait until a pic goes viral to do this. Cornyyy.

The performance was part of NPR’s Black Music Month programming, spotlighting albums that shaped culture and continue to resonate today.\nOriginally released in 2010,Kush & Orange Juicefused laid-back production with a lifestyle-first approach that became a signature for the Pittsburgh native. For this late anniversary celebration, he curated a live set that pulled from both the original mixtape and his recent follow-up,Kush & Orange Juice 2. The sequel builds on the original’s energy with a more mature edge, and the two projects sat comfortably side by side in this live reimagining.\nWiz Khalifa’sbandbrought a hometown feel and familiar chemistry. With DJ Bonics on turntables, Kenneth Wright as music director and bassist, Uncle Bubz on keys, Russell Gelman-Sheehan on guitar and Kendall Lewis on drums, the group worked through a six-song set that included “Mezmorized,” “Never Been” and “Red Eye,” to name a few.",

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 6.10.2025\nRap fans are done hearing Drake “complain about b**ches,” at least, that’s how JPEGMAFIA sees it. In a Tuesday (June 10) interview withBillboard, the “Baby I’m Bleeding” artist weighed in on why listeners are craving something new, not just from Drake, but from Hip Hop at large.\nWhen asked if he thinks hardcore music might increasingly crossover with rap — something he’s already flirted with heavily onI LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU— the New York native responded, “I think a lot of people are gonna jump on that.” He continued, “[People are] gonna realize [that] what you guys are doing is boring as s**t. People yearn for something new, especially in rap.”\n“We don’t wanna hear Drake complain about b**hes anymore,” JPEGMAFIA said. “We don’t f**king care. He’s 40.” For the record, the Canadian superstar is actually 38, and while plenty of his songs admittedly revolve around women, he’s also branched out into more genres than most artists could dream of. His February track “NOKIA” tapped into dance territory, and “Calling For You,” offFor All The Dogs, found him testing the waters of sexy drill.\nThis isn’t the first time JPEGMAFIA took a jab at Drake. He previouslytook shots at the “Hotline Bling” hitmakeron his aforementioned 2024 project. Most notably, on “New Black History,” he accused people of “cashing out for PDFs and rapers (No Drizzy).” Then, on “it’s dark and hell is hot,” the Brooklyn native appeared to double down on the same accusations Kendrick Lamar leveled on “Not Like Us,” with him spitting, “If I show you a Drac’, I ain’t playin’ with kids.”",

On Monday (June 9), the Chicago rapper’s latest $4.5 million bail offer, which included cash, 24-hour home detention, electronic monitoring and private security, was denied.\n“The sentence is mandatory life without parole, which could make flight the rational choice for any innocent defendant,” U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgeraldreportedly said. While he acknowledged Lil Durk “does not appear to be a candidate for flight,” the five-page court ruling did point to the rapper’s alleged attempt to flee the country to Dubai.\nThey also argued the proposed terms, which include Lil Durk’s mother’s home and $1 million from Alamo Records, lean “very much” in his favor. According to prosecutors, the $4.5 million proposed bail makes up only a small fraction of the Grammy Award winner’s net worth, meaning he would “still have his intellectual property with which to earn a handsome living abroad.”",

Although her profile rises by the day, she is seemingly sticking to her roots of being “F**k n**ga free.” Sunday morning (Jan. 12), the multi-platinum rap star shared her reasoning for remaining single as she continues to grow.\nIn anInstagram Story video, GloRilla stated, “I ain’t got no n**ga because I’m such a real n**ga myself, and you n**gas be b**ches.” Further explaining her point, she said that she goes as far as cursing men out who she feels have played with her, and she is not afraid to let any of them know.\nOne fan responded, “As much as people want to downplay being in a relationship; being in love is a beautiful thing to the right person.” Shortly after, another user shared, “She hasn’t found anyone to put her in her feminine energy.” While another person explained, “Idc how much money you got, don’t no man want a masculine woman.”\nThe overwhelming sentiment on the clip was that Glo has some underlying issues that prevent her from being able to be happy with a partner. Some people pointed to her lyrics in various songs to build out the narrative that she is not willing to be feminine towards her partners. The Memphis-raised emcee has had multiple emcees try to their luck when it comes to trying to take her out. Artists like Fredo Bang,Bossman Dlowand more have expressed interest in the buzzing bar spitter.\nAlthough her love life may be a source of criticism, musically, GloRilla is at the top of her game. The “LET HER COOK” recording artist received multiple Grammy nominations for her hit song, “Yeah Glo!” The radio-friendly smash is up for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the67th Annual Grammy Awards. The prestigious award show is scheduled to take place on Feb. 2, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\nWatch the music video for the Grammy nominated banger below!",

Chief Justice John Roberts, however, quickly outlined the Court’s “main concern”: ByteDance’s legal obligation to cooperate with Chinese intelligence operations.\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who stepped in for theBiden administration, weighed in on the potential risks, noting that most of TikTok’s 170 million American users likely don’t see the danger now but might regret it later. “For the Chinese government to have this vast trove of incredibly sensitive data about them, I think, obviously exposes our nation as a whole to a risk of espionage and blackmail,” she shared.",

He added, “Also, the prisoners who were out there risking [their] lives need time [knocked] off their sentences.

The incarcerated participants volunteer through the Conservation (Fire) Camps Program, which spans 35 camps across 25 counties in California. According toCBS News, they assist by “cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to help slow fires' spread.” Other duties include cooking, operating the water treatment facilities and doing laundry.\nIn an earlier Instagram post, Brown claimed that someone was “starting these fires,” a theory that may have some truth to it. Los Angeles authorities arrested a man in Woodland Hills following reports of someone attempting to ignite a blaze. The suspect, whose identity hasn’t been released, was allegedly armed with a “propane tank or a flamethrower.”\nA Los Angeles resident himself, the “No Guidance” artist didn’t share whether he was affected by the fires, although plenty of others have.

The legal proceedings come on the heels of the controversial rapper being involved in an altercation at one of the popular gym chains.\nOn Friday (Jan. 17),TMZreported that “Tekashi — real name Daniel Hernandez — is alleging the gym staff was not properly educated or informed regarding security protocols at LA Fitness, claiming employees failed to promptly request police presence once they were aware of the attack.” The alleged assault happened in 2023.\nIn response tothe story, one fan exclaimed, “He thought LA fitness employees were about to scrap for him getting paid $14.99 an hour.” Another user asked, “So suing the move in Hip Hop now?” This question is seemingly alluding to Drake’s pending lawsuit againstUniversal Music Groupand streaming giant, Spotify. Many fans believe when a rapper willingly includes law enforcement in their issues, it is taboo within the genre.\nTekashi 6ix9ine has been known to ruffle the feathers of many people within the rap community. Artists like Lil Durk, Meek Mill and many others have shown disdain for the multi-colored-hair emcee. While he has faced some criticism from many artists, he has also collaborated with top level recording artists such as A Boogie Wit da Hoodie,Kodak Blackand Trippie Red.\n6ix9ine has had a long-standing relationship with equally controversial media pundit, DJ Akademiks. The YouTuber-turned-culture-critic closely documented his career, including his heavily covered racketeering charge. In November 2024, the “Trollz” rapper was “slapped with a 45-day jail sentence as punishment for violating the terms of his release [in October] — as a Manhattan federal judge pilloried him, saying that the rainbow-haired rapper doesn’t ‘believe the rules apply to you,’” according to theNew York Post.\n6ix9ine has yet to publicly comment on the new lawsuit.",

Ironically, while the Republican leader was an early advocate for banning the app, he promised during his presidential campaign to “save TikTok.” Whether he can follow through in time is anyone’s guess.\n“Our position on this has been clear: TikTok should continue to operate under American ownership.

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 1.15.2025\nDrake is playing chess, not checkers. On Wednesday (Jan. 15), less than 24 hours afterdismissing his first of two legal petitionsagainst Universal Music Group, theMore Lifecreator filed a defamation suit in federal court over Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.”\nThe new lawsuit claims that UMG “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit from a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile.\" Throughout the Mustard-produced track, Lamar called the Toronto artist a “certified pedophile” and “69 God,” in addition to the notable “I hear you like 'em young” line.\nInterestingly, Drake is not actually targeting the Compton MC. “This lawsuit is not about the artist who created ‘Not Like Us,’” legal documents obtained byBillboardread. “It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false but dangerous.”\nElsewhere, the filing revealed that Drake tried to settle the claims with UMG privately, even speaking with the label’s CEO Lucian Grainge, whom hereportedly inked a $400 million dealwith in 2022. Per the rapper, the world’s largest music company said he would “face humiliation if he brought legal action — presuming that the public would be unable to understand UMG’s role in exploiting and profiting from this dispute.”\nThe suit more or less doubles down on many of the points introduced in the “Nonstop” hitmaker’s earlier petitions. UMG is being accused of using bots and payola to boost the aforementioned diss track in an attempt to devalue his brand and music.\nElsewhere, Drake argued that “Not Like Us” — which used his Toronto mansion, The Embassy, for its cover — “subjected him to the risk of physical violence.” He then cited a drive-by shooting, presumably referring to the incident thatleft one of his security guards hospitalizedin May 2024. According to his lawyers, the five-time Grammy Award winner was “left with no choice but to seek legal redress against UMG.”",

According to theViewsartist, Interscope Records executives simply wanted to “maximize their own profits.”\n“The suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue,” a spokesperson for the music conglomerate responded. “No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.”\nSpotify, for its part, stated it had “no economic incentivefor users to stream ‘Not Like Us’ over any of Drake’s tracks.” In their statement, they explained, “Only one of Spotify for Artists’ tools, Marquee, was purchased on behalf of the song, for €500 to promote the track in France. Marquee is a visual ad that is disclosed to users as a Sponsored Recommendation.”\nIt is worth mentioning that Drake’ssecond petition against UMG, filed in Texas, remains active, with a hearing set for later this month. Originally scheduled for Monday (Jan. 13), it was postponed to Jan. 28. In that particular legal action, he argued that UMG distributed “Not Like Us” with the knowledge that it “falsely” accused him of being a pedophile.\nSince lodging the two petitions, a surprising number of artists have voiced their support for Drake. 50 Cent, for instance, told Andrew Schulz on the “Flagrant” podcast, “Everything he said [UMG] did in that lawsuit, they did it.”Russ also weighed in, pointing out that Spotify “outing major labels is a lose-lose for everyone involved.”",

On Thursday (Jan. 23), the record company submitted a 144-page motion to throw out the case, which they claim was filed in the wrong state in the first place.\nIn thecourt filing, UMG alleged that Drake “resorted to strategic legal retaliation” in an attempt to “pressure them to limit the distribution” of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” It further stated, “The [Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991] protects parties from this exact kind of legal retaliation by providing an expedited process to summarily dismiss legal actions, including petitions for pre-suit depositions brought under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 202, that are designed and intended to intimidate and punish people for exercising their First Amendment rights.”\nElsewhere, UMG contends that the petition should be dismissed because Drake “did not file his peition in a ‘proper court'” since no representatives for the company reside in Bexar County, as required by state law. They also argued that he “already filed suit on his potential claims, obviating any need for pre-suit discovery.” That, of course, refers to the defamation case the “Best I Ever Had” artistlodged in New Yorkearlier in the month.\nUMG’s motion to dismiss offers a glimpse into the defense strategies they’ll likely use in the upcoming lawsuit. On Wednesday (Jan. 22), Judge Jeannette Vargas granted the company a 34-day extension due to the Los Angeles wildfires. She ruled that their response to the rapper’s claims would now be due by March 17 instead of the original Feb. 11 deadline.\nAs for the pre-action petition in Texas, Drake and UMG’s hearing is scheduled for Jan. 28 — unless a judge decides to dismiss it.

The “Dark Knight Dummo” hitmaker first began dating Leray in 2019, though they later split that same year.

On Tuesday (Jan. 28) night, during an interview with CBS, the “Nights Like This” creator shared that awards should not change how artists see their work but rather serve as confirmation that they are evolving.\n“I wanna say, and this is in the most respectful and grateful way, that it hasn’t changed anything. These things shouldn’t shape your perception of your art as an artist,” the Oakland, California native explained. “They should just confirm that you’re getting better at telling your story.”\nKehlani has been nominated a total of five times to date, two of which stem from their fourth studio album,CRASH. The 13-track offering is competing for Best Progressive R&B Album against Childish Gambino’sBando Stone and The New World, Avery*Sunshine’sSo Glad to Know You, NxWorries’Why Lawd?and Durand Bernarr’sEn Route.",

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 1.29.2025\nJ. Cole completed another trip around the sun on Tuesday (Jan. 28). Ahead of his 40th birthday, he launched a new blog called The Algorithm — an extension of his“Inevitable” audio series— to share “random s**t” with fans. While many fans took it as a sign that his long-anticipated seventh studio album,The Fall Off, was near, the North Carolina rapper wasted no time clarifying that is not the case.\n“I [have] been wanting a lil blog for years. Somewhere to post random s**t I f**k with where the audience is way smaller than it is on the social media platforms,” he shared on Monday (Jan. 27). “[I] finally pulled the trigger. [Bear] with us as we [are] still developing this page and the layout.”\nAlongside an attachment of Ahmad Lewis’ “Back in the Day - Remix,” which J. Cole said he has “been loving” since he was 9, he took a moment to thank fans. “Now, at midnight, I will turn 40. [I] might save the sentimentals for a post tomorrow. But in a nutshell, I’m grateful,” theBorn Sinnerartist wrote. “Happy New Year to y’all, and God bless. 2025 will be a good one.”\nIn afollow-up postthe next day, J. Cole addressed the album speculation. “Not exactly,” he said regarding whether it was on the way. “When it’s time for something, you will know. This is not that. I just wanted a place to share documentaries I [watch] on YouTube and songs I f**k with.”\nThe North Carolina-raised artist launched the first — and so far, only — season of “Inevitable” in November 2024. Spanning 10 episodes, each named after one of his projects, the series chronicled the Dreamville Records founder’s journey in music. Coinciding with the drops, fans finally gotThe Come Up Mixtape Vol. 1andFriday Night Lightson DSPs, along with the deluxe edition of2014 Forest Hills Drive.\nThoughThe Fall Offdoes not have a release date at current, J. Cole is set to headline the fifth and finalDreamville Festat Raleigh, North Carolina’s Dorothea Dix Park in April. “Watching people from all over the world and all walks of life gather here each year has been one of the most fulfilling chapters of our journey,” event organizers shared on social media.",

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 2.4.2025\nDespite “Not Like Us” being one of 2024’s biggest records, Kendrick Lamar surprised fans by leaving it off his sixth studio album,GNX. However, thanks to Terrence “Punch” Henderson, we finally have some insight into why. On Monday (Feb. 3) night, the Top Dawg Entertainment president practically summed it up in one word: “integrity.”\nWhile celebrating Top Dawg Entertainment’s historic night — with Doechii becoming thethird woman to win Best Rap Albumand SZA taking home Best R&B Song — Punch took some time to answer questions from fans. One person asked, “Do you have some education for us as to why Dot didn't include the mega smash on the album?”\nPunch responded, “Integrity. That record was for the battle. The album was a separate thing. Could have put it on there to boost overall sales but choose to leave it for what it was.”\nHad “Not Like Us” been included onGNX, it would have only added to the LP’s massive success. After all, the projectdebuted atop the Billboard 200 chartwith 319,000 album-equivalent units. As for the diss track itself, it surpassed 1 billion streams on Spotify in January, preceded by two nonconsecutive weeks at the top of the Hot 100 the previous year.",

PARTYNEXTDOOR croons, “I wanna be your favorite again / Let's reconnect on the jet on the way to where I live / Give you a second to get ready, then we right back into action.”\nAlongside the trailer, Drake shared a link to his “Members Only” playlist — named after their collaboration onFor All The Dogs— which basically consists of all of their greatest hits over the years. Starting with 2013’s “Over Here,” the collection of songs included fan favorites like “Recognize” and “Come and See Me.” There were also tracks fromIf You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, like “Wednesday Night Interlude” and “Preach,” as well as “Since Way Back” from 2017’sMore Life.",

There are text messages and communications that totally refute these baseless claims. Additionally, Ms. Luna and Ms. Altayri were never employees of Top Dawg Entertainment.

After all, Ye has name-dropped a lot of people recently — Drake, Dave Chappelle, Adin Ross, Diddy, andeven the late Virgil Abloh— so the list of possibilities isn’t exactly short.\nDespite the obvious threat at hand, Ye continued his days-long tweeting spree. In anow-deleted post, he urged Kendrick Lamar to shout, “Free Puff” at the Super Bowl LIX and, for some reason, started posting adult content. It’s a rather unfortunate way to watch the Hip Hop icon spiral, but he’s surprisingly bounced back from plenty worse.",

Arguably the most athletic on the field that night, the “Himothy” artist scored a touchdown with less than a few seconds left on the clock.\nLivestreamed on YouTube, Quavo caught the ball across the field, sprinted down the sideline, and hit Duke Dennis — who, naturally, was playing for Kai Cenat’s opposing team — with a hook and ladder before making it to the end zone. With barely any time left to close the one-point gap, Mike Vick made a last-ditch attempt at a comeback, but YouTuber Adam Waheed thankfully intercepted the ball.\n“I feel like the MVP, you know what I’m saying? Great moments happen at the end of the game. You got to step up and win,” the Atlanta rapper said in a post-game interview. “I started out a little sluggish, you dig? TheFanaticsparty had me slow a little bit, but we’re having fun. Speed told me to step up. I had to get my s**t together.”",

I can have so many other records that have different narratives and tones, you know, like reflection, right?”\nHe went on to say, “To reserve a space for that one that I want everyone to hear, that’s what pushes me. That’s why I like ‘man at the garden.’ Even the fact that it’s at the top of the record.”\nOf all the tracks onGNX, “man at the garden” might be the least popular, given that it lacked the jabs and sly references that fueled much ofthe Pulitzer Prize winner’s 2024 run. Instead, Lamar took a moment to reflect on why he “deserves it all,” from respect and accolades to more money and freedom.\n“I mean that s**t, bro. ‘man at the garden,’ I mean every word on that motherf**ker, man.

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 2.17.2025\nMegan Thee Stallion is officially in the wine and spirits business. To celebrate her 30th birthday, the “Bigger in Texas” rapper launched herlong-anticipated tequila brand, Chicas Divertidas, Spanish for “fun girls.”\nAvailable for pre-order starting on Saturday (Feb. 15), blanco is Megan’s go-to for a smooth pour, with citrus notes and hints of rosemary and green tea that combine for a “silky-smooth finish.” Meanwhile, reposado was made for slow slipping. It features a mix of caramelized agave, American oak and cooking spices for a more “elegant finish.”\n\"As someone who values good vibes and great memories, I knew I wanted to create a tequila that was designed to be shared and savored with my Hotties,\" Megan shared in apress statement. \"Smooth, sultry, and premium. This process has been years in the making, and I'm so proud to take this next step in my journey as an entrepreneur and launch this brand.”\nTheGrammy Award winnerwent all out with the bottle design — arguably one of the best we’ve seen from a rapper in years — drawing heavy inspiration from the alluring but deadly flower Angel’s Trumpet. The crown features a dagger-pierced heart, which, according to Megan, represents the brand’s motto: “Keep it cute, classy and cut-throat.”",

After being announced as Def Jam’s newest signee in January, he has been on an absolute roll. Setting the tone with the release of the remix of his hit song “Tweaker” withLil Wayne, the former ball player left it all on the court with his performance during the NBA’s Saturday (Feb. 15) night edition of All-Star Weekend events at the Chase Center in San Francisco.\nThe performance showcased the former NBA G League prospect’s first televised production since performing the hit song at the 2025 NFL playoff game. After being announced by his older brother, Lonzo Ball, Gelo swerved and bent the corner with a group of Golden State Warriors dancers to recite the catchy hook from his new single. After getting settled onto the court, he ran through his two verses even though he was seemingly a bit out of breath towards the end of the track.\nDuring the performance, various high-level athletes and sports media personalities had feedback regarding his new offering. Jemele Hill stated, “That breath control got Gelo fighting for his life.” Skip Bayless asserted, “Good for Gelo Ball. He couldn't play basketball the way his younger and older brother can, now he's become a THING in the rap game. Unbelievable.” While this critique was kind, it could be a bit bias seeing as though Bayless is a huge fan of Lil Wayne, who was featured on the “Tweaker” remix.",

As it turns out, Steel was “unaware,” which completely makes sense, considering the tracklist was only unveiled that same morning.\n“I have had the honor and pleasure of meeting with Mr. Graham,” Steel wrote backvia email. “He is so kind, considerate, generous, inspirational, intelligent — a true leader and great model for our community.\"\nIn a separate reply, the legal professional went on to say, “I want no attention. I truly want our community to stop suffocating people and the attempt to stop [the] advancement of ideas, inventions, cultures, [and] freedoms for all.” Though Drake has teased but a few songs, namely “Crying In Chanel” and “$omebody Loves Me,” one can only imagine “Brian Steel” is the Grammy Award winner’s first collaboration with Young Thug sincehis release from prisonback in October 2024.\nThe two artists last teamed up on the 21 Savage-assisted “It’s Up” as a part of Drake’s 100 GIGS rollout. Prior to that, he and the YSL Records rapper worked together on “Oh U Went” and “Parade on Cleveland” from 2023’sBUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 2.12.2025\nIt seems like everyone is stepping away from Ye these days, including his most frequent collaborator, Ty Dolla Sign. On Wednesday (Feb. 12), the “Memories” singer took to social media to condemn hate speech, coincidentally just days after his ¥$ counterpart’santisemitic tirade.\n“I do not condone any form of hate speech towards anyone,” Ty Dolla Sign wrote on hisInstagram Stories, alongside raised fist emojis in every skin tone. Though he didn’t mention Ye by name, the timing said it all.\nThe real question is: Why now? Back when Ye was fresh off the “White Lives Matter” T-shirt controversy and denying the Holocaust, Ty Dolla Sign was one of the first artists to stand by him. In fact, their 2023 collaboration “VULTURES” had Ye doubling down on the very thing that cost him millions: “How I'm antisemitic? I just f**ked a Jewish b**ch / I just f**ked Scooter's b**ch and we ran her like Olympics.”\nOne of the more obvious reasons for Ty's IG Story message is that standing next to Ye can be a business risk, especially when you don’t have his$2.77 billion net worthas a safety net. If the California native was fine working with the “Heartless” rapper through every past controversy, it could very easily be damage control.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Ty Dolla Sign and Ye dropped “Wheels Fall Off” not long after the whole “Yaydolf Yitler” comments and everything that came with it. Not to mention,VULTURES 3is still on the bill for 2025, marking the third and likely final installment in their album series under the ¥$ moniker.\nKnowing Ye, it wouldn’t be shocking if it gets pushed back once again or scrapped altogether. After all, his Shopify store and social media accounts were shadow banned or deactivated within the past week, so the rollout already isn’t looking great.\nTy Dolla Sign really only has two choices here. One is to distance himself from a longtime friend and collaborator. The other is to drop music so good that people move on from everything that’s happened. Given the success of their chart-topping hit “CARNIVAL,” both are possible, albeit risky. If Ty did cut ties, would you feel that at this point, it’s too little, too late?",

On Wednesday (Feb. 12) at midnight, the artist dropped herWhat Happened To Forever?EP, which, as the title suggests, seemingly unpacks herturbulent split with Trippie Redd.\nThe five-song offering opened with “Keep It,” in which Leray crooned, “All the times I caught you cheatin' / I should've killed you, but now you gon' have to see this / Supposed to be my peace but broke me right into pieces.” Interestingly, it was one of the first tracks teased from the short-notice release — and arguably one of her most vulnerable.\nThe project later moved into “Leave You Alone,” where Leray comes to terms with the fact that some things just are not meant to last. “Should’ve kept it real, but you was fraudulent,” she declared on the Taylor Hill-produced track.\nBy the time the EP wraps up with “Lick Back,” Leray is fully in her bag. On the track, she flexes about only dealing with rich men and ballers “just like Babe Ruth” while rocking “big diamond chains,” among other braggadocious bars. It is a noticeable departure from the heavier moments earlier in the project, but a refreshingly happy one at that.",

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 2.10.2025\nKendrick Lamar put Hip Hop front and center at theSuper Bowl LIX. On Sunday (Feb. 9) night, while the Kansas City Chiefs suffered a brutal loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Compton rapper brought the energy of his hometown straight into New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome.\nLamar opened his roughly 13-minute set with an unreleased song, which admittedly was an unexpected move for one of the biggest televised events of the year. Before segueing into the next track, he declared, “The revolution 'bout to be televised / You picked the right time, but the wrong guy.” Fittingly, he followed it up with his fifth Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 track, “squabble up,” which, to date, has amassed over 41 million YouTube views.\nBut before he could finish it, Uncle Sam — played by Samuel L. Jackson — interjected, “No, no, no. Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto. Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game? Then tighten up.” That led straight into “HUMBLE.” and “DNA.,” two of the rapper’s biggest records fromDAMN., arguably his most commercially successful album.\nIt would have been great if Lamar kept the momentum going with chart-topping hits like “m.A.A.d city,” “Money Trees” or even “Alright”; but, in true K. Dot fashion, he was totally unpredictable and gave viewers a live rendition of “euphoria,” one of his scathing Drake disses released in April 2024. And the crowd went wild!",

On Tuesday (Feb. 25) night, representatives for the Canadian rapper announced the trek’s surprise cancellation due to a “scheduling conflict.”\nAlthough they didn’t share further explanation — perhaps it’s something to do with Drake’s lawsuit against United Music Group — new dates will be announced in the near future. “Due to a scheduling conflict, four of Drake’s 16 sold-out shows in Australia and New Zealand will be postponed,” the tour update read, perRolling Stone. “We are actively working on rescheduling these dates along with adding some additional shows.”\nThe “Hotline Bling” artist began the arena run on Feb. 4 at Perth’s RAC Arena and, after a few nights there, moved on to the Rod Laver Arena and Qudos Bank Arena (also known as The Sydney SuperDome) in Melbourne and Sydney, respectively. From there, he did back-to-back shows at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.",

The diss came in response to Barker’s “Cry Bhabie,” which many argued borrowed elements of Latto’s flow — which is fitting, considering she previously appeared in the Atlanta rapper’s “Brokey” video.\nBhad Bhabie then took a dig at Barker for mentioning her child’s father, Le Vaughn, cleverly nodding to Will Smith’s infamous Oscars slap in 2022: “Keep my baby daddy name out yo' f**kin' mouth 'fore I Will Smith it / This h** belong all in the zoo, see, I don't understand / She f**ked on Tyga and killin' babies, I seen the sonogram.”\nThroughout the rest of the two-minute-long offering, Bhad Bhabie impressively manages to pack in plenty. She name-dropped Soulja Boy, the Kardashians,Marlon Wayansand Jackboy, referenced Drake’s “God’s Plan,” and even played with a Travis Barker look-alike toward the end of the Apex Visions-directed video.\nWho would’ve guessed the “Cash Me Outside” girl would be the one to set off 2025’s first rap feud, especially given how often today’s rap girlies trade subliminals, but we’re not complaining.

The project leaned heavily into R&B with tracks such as “CN TOWER” and “DEEPER,” but there were definitely some rap-heavy moments too, like “SMALL TOWN FAME,” “BRIAN STEEL” and “GIMME A HUG.”\nThe Valentine’s Day release notably served as Drake’s 14th overall No. 1. He now ties JAY-Z and Taylor Swift, whom — if his burner Instagram account is anything to go by — he could possibly surpass later in the year. For PARTYNEXTDOOR, however, the achievement was a major first.\nThe \"Break From Toronto\" singer's most recent solo album,PARTYNEXTDOOR 4 (P4), debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 in 2024. Meanwhile, his previous releases,PARTYNEXTDOOR 3andPARTYMOBILE, fared slightly better at No. 3 and No. 8, respectively.\nHistorically, R&B projects haven’t had an easy path to No. 1, but the past few months have been a welcoming change of direction. SZA’s sophomore album,SOS,returned to the topin December 2024, largely thanks to the release of its deluxe edition,LANA.

On Thursday (Feb. 20), the North Carolina rapper unveiled his first release of the year, \"cLOUDs,\" in which he touched on everything fromDonald Trump’s assassination attemptto the growing conversation around artificial intelligence.\n“Before long, all the songs the whole world sings’ll/ Be generated by latest of AI regimes/ As all of our favorite artists erased by it scream/ From the wayside, ‘Aye, whatever happened to human beings?’\" Cole spat in the song’s second verse. Earlier in the DZL- and Omen-produced cut, available exclusively viaThe Algorithm, he name-dropped Spike Lee and called out “billionaires who don't care the world's gon' break,” among other topics.\n“Just wanted to share,” he wrote on his website. “Made this a few days ago, then I added a second verse and was like, ‘Man I got a blog now, I can put whatever I want up there.’”\nCole obviously isn’t the first artist to question AI’s role in music, but his take certainly brings the conversation back to the forefront. Instead of calling for bans and regulations — as we’ve seen withCardi B, Nicki Minaj and several others — the Dreamville Records founder instead reflected on the growing fear that artificial intelligence could replace human creativity much sooner than expected.\nAI, much like in other industries, is a bit of a mixed bag at the moment. Some, like Drake and Ye, have embraced it, with “Taylor Made Freestyle” — which used the late Tupac Shakur’s likeness — andVULTURES 2, respectively. On the other hand, more than 200 artists, including Doechii, Metro Boomin, Ayra Starr and Hit-Boy,signed an open letterwarning against the “predatory use of AI” in 2024.\nIn April, the “No Role Modelz” rapper is slated to headline the fifth and finalDreamville Festfrom April 5 to April 6 at Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, North Carolina. Unfortunately,The Fall Offseemingly won’t be dropping before then.

Some party songs would be fun, you know, things that they would play in the club,” she said.\nOne example, in particular, that really drove the point home was her Grammy Award-winning \"Hrs & Hrs.” Long even recalled hearing the record in rotation with Hip Hop acts like Sexyy Red andXXLFreshman Class pick BossMan Dlow in the club. “Everybody, including the men — thugged out; I’m talking about all types of chains and gold teeth and all that.

On Tuesday (Feb. 18), during a sit-down withBritish Vogue, the “PUSH 2 START” singer made it clear she is putting the whole Black vs. Coloured debate behind her for good.\n“You know that even if you give the best explanation, people will still choose not to understand,” Tyla told thepublicationregarding why she is not wasting energy trying to make everyone see the bigger picture. “But I’m at a point where I know who I am. I know I’m a Black woman, and I know I’m a Coloured woman as well, and you can be both.”\nShe added, “And the people that care to learn, they understand now. And that’s enough for me.” One would hope the Johannesburg, South African native would not have to keep explaining herself, especially when the loudest critics are the ones unwilling to grasp the cultural context in the first place. But here we are.\nThe controversy surrounding Tyla’s identity picked up traction in 2023 after an old TikTok resurfaced where she described herself as a “Coloured South African.” The Grammy Award winner’s phrasing particularly caught stateside fans off guard, given that “colored” is an outdated term tied to segregation in the United States. However, inSouth Africa, “Coloured” is still an official racial classification with a completely different meaning.",

She gave him half a point before noting, “I feel like you [can] tell when I’m upset when I give you the silent treatment.”\nElsewhere, they talked about their favorite TV show to watch together, with Durk naming \"Bates Motel\" and \"Dexter.\" According to Royale, though, it’s actually \"Game of Thrones.\" He joked, “I be playing with her. ‘So, who do you want to protect you: me or Jon Snow?’ I know she’s really saying him [in the back of her mind], but she says me to make me feel good.”",

The last-mentioned city would’ve been the leg’s final stop.\n“Towards the end of our rehearsals, Renée damaged ligaments in her knee, and whilst alongside our team, we have tried our best to find a solution, we just aren't able to give you the show we want at this time and a tour that you deserve,” the letter to their fans continued.",

Come on, my boy,” he claimed via hisInstagram Story. “I don’t even do none of this. Everybody knows the factuals, though.” Dex later warned his “Goyard” collaborator to “stop playing with me.”\nThough Rich The Kid didn’t directly respond to the “PICK IT UP” rapper’s comments, he coincidentallyposted a videoon Sunday (March 2) of Dave Chappelle’s iconic Tyrone Biggums skit, where the character makes a peanut butter and crack sandwich. Notably, Dex has struggled with drug addiction for years, particularly with Xanax, to the point that he even went to rehab.\nDex taking credit for Rich The Kid’s career is a serious reach, especially given that the “Plug Walk” hitmaker was one of the first artists signed to Quality Control Music. He also had an impressive run with Migos — some even considered him the group’s unofficial fourth member — thanks to tracks like “Trap,” “Goin’ Crazy,” and “Change.” Not to mention, “New Freezer” featuring Kendrick Lamar gave the Queens native his first Hot 100 entry.\nIf anything, YoungBoy Never Broke Again andYe probably played a bigger rolein Rich The Kid’s more recent success, given how far “For Keeps” and “CARNIVAL” went. That being said, Dex is still one of the most successful artists to come out of Rich Forever Music, previously home to Jay Critch, 83 Babies, and Young Bino.\nRich The Kid and Dex have patched things up before, so it’s not entirely out of the question that they’ll do it again.

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 2.27.2025\nASAP Rocky’s legal troubles with Terell “ASAP Relli” Ephron aren’t over just yet. Despite the Harlem rapperbeing found not guiltyon two gun assault charges earlier in the month, he’s now facing another round in court.\nOn Wednesday (Jan. 26), a Los Angeles judge scheduled a Jan. 12, 2026, trial date for Ephron’s civil suit against Rocky, which had been on hold during the criminal trial proceedings. Much like the previous case, the plaintiff is claiming the rapper pulled a handgun and fired at him during a verbal dispute on Nov. 6, 2021.\n“We intend to continue litigating this case. The standard in a criminal case is much higher than the preponderance of the evidence standard in a civil matter,” Melissa Mikail, Ephron’s lawyer, shared with the court, perRolling Stone. She added, “We still believe that our claims have merit, and we intend on fully litigating them.”\nThere’s definitely a chance the civil suit could play out differently than the criminal case. The former has a lower burden of proof, meaning Ephron only has to show that it’s “more likely than not” that Rocky committed the alleged act — far from the “beyond a reasonable doubt” requirement that led to his acquittal on Feb. 18.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that at least one juror wasn’t convinced byRocky’s “prop gun” defense. The jury pool, made up of five women and five men, had some members who “didn’t really believe it,” at least according to her: “It was kind of a little mysterious the way it disappeared, and they couldn’t produce it, you know, as evidence.”\nThat said, Relli’s credibility took a massive hit during the criminal trial — especially after he admitted to deleting text messages — and Rocky’sdefense teamwill likely use that to argue against his claims again. Ultimately, it’ll all depend on how the evidence is framed come 2026.",

On Wednesday (Feb. 26), the lateCrenshawrapper’s brother, Blacc Sam, confirmed that new music will be arriving in the summertime.\nDuring an interview with Power 106 Los Angeles, Blacc Sam shared that Hussle had been working on a project with Bino Rideaux that was “pretty much” 80 percent complete before his passing. “The team kind of came in and got some unreleased verses in music that he had done with Bino, and just kind of tightened it up,” he explained. “It sounds amazing, and it should be dropping this summer.”\nMike & Keys, Axl Folie and My Guy Mars, who worked on songs like “Double Up,” “Dedication” and “Hustle & Motivate” from 2018’sVictory Lap, are also confirmed on the production side.

Taking to social media later that evening, the Chicago rapper clarified that the brief snippet fans heard was actually AI-generated.\n\"I'm not in the middle of none of this AI beef, people throwing my voice on things, the whole 'CARNIVAL' sample,” Ye said via hisInstagram Stories. The Grammy Award winner also revealed that he had just gotten off the phone with Travis Barker, the father of Alabama Barker, who “Ms. Whitman” was directed at.\n“I would never be in the middle [of this],” Ye added. “I don’t even know what’s going on. I just got sent a song and asked if I could clear the sample.\" Even so, to say he’s unaware of the track might be an understatement, considering a representative from his team reportedly told Bhad Bhabie her diss record was “harder than the original.”\n“The only reason I clear anything is because so many people try to stop me,” the father of four explained later in the video. “They stop clearances and everything. It’s been very difficult for me, so if somebody asks me for something, I always clear it.”\nAnyone familiar with Ye knows he’s had his fair share of clearance issues.VULTURES 1, for example, ledDonna Summer’s estateto sue him for “shamelessly” using her “I Feel Love” on the now-removed “GOOD (DON’T DIE)” without permission. Prior to that, Black Sabbath’s Ozzy Osbourne took issue with Ye sampling “Iron Man” for the chart-topping “CARNIVAL.”\nThe bottom line is that Ye is “not cool with being put in the middle” of Bhad Bhabie and Alabama’s feud. Despite if it has a remix with Ye or not, the Florida native’s “Ms. Whitman” is putting up incredible numbers on the board. To date, the accompanying video has over 3.5 million YouTube views and still holds the No. 1 spot on the platform’s trending music chart.",

I am so famous that I could see the preview,” she joked a few seconds into watching the two-minute clip. Season 5 picks up with Joe seemingly falling for a new character, Bronte, despite claiming he’s buried his “old self.” Of course, his wife, Kate Lockwood, and son, Henry Goldberg, are still in the picture — which admittedly makes everything all the more interesting.\n“Who’s doing the killing?” Cardi B asked. “Who’s raising the boy?” As to be expected with the series, Joe doesn’t appear to be turning over a new leaf anytime soon. There’s still plenty of blood, deceit and obsession to go around, hopefully with Tati Gabrielle returning to portray Marienne Bellamy.\n“I cannot wait. Oh my God, I gotta watch this season,” the “Up” artist said. “I gotta finish my album so I can watch this season in peace,” she added, referring to herlong-overdue sophomore effort, which was supposed to be released in 2024.",

I feel like superstars go through that,” she emphasized. “Every superstar has [gone] through something in their career, and that’s how you overcome it.”\nShe’s got a point, given that plenty of female rappers have faced the same struggle. Flo Milli, for example, went viral with “In The Party,” only to have to once again remind the world of her star power with “Never Lose Me” a few years later. Despite stacking hit after hit, Ice Spice also landed in that weird space where the internet has seemingly moved on just as quickly as it crowned her.\nIn fact, Yung Miami also brought up that point later in the sit-down. “I feel like people move on easily. It’s like you’re hot today and cold tomorrow,” she said. That doesn’t mean the Florida native lost her core audience, though.

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 3.6.2025\nNine Vicious is a name Hip Hop will be hearing a lot more often in the coming months, at least if the “You Said” artist’s latest co-sign from Young Thug means anything.\nOn Wednesday (March 5), theBarter 6rapper quoted the “Oh, you fancy, huh? / You pop tags, huh?” lines from Nine Vicious’ “U Fancy.” The track, which now has a little over a quarter-million views on its visual treatment from last year, sampled Drake’s early classic “Fancy.”\nEven before the aforementioned track, Nine Vicious had already built momentum with SoundCloud drops like “I Love You” and “I’ll Neva,” both of which had the familiar bounce of new-age Atlanta music. Then, in 2024, he stepped it up withB4SAand his debut mixtape,Studio Addict. The 13-track project delivered surefire cuts like “F&N,” “Tokyo,” and “Ye,” where the Athens native name-dropped Travis Scott and Diddy.\nComing off the heels of January’sB4TM, Nine Vicious seems to be gearing up for more new music. On Tuesday (March 4), he revealed the cover art fortumblr music— an interesting choice, considering most of his fans are probably too young to have ever used the platform. The cover itself is a recreation of Tupac Shakur’sAll Eyez On Me, which has already raised some eyebrows. Then again, plenty of people were skeptical of Young Thug’s creative direction early on and look how that turned out.",

As if the lineup weren’t stacked enough, Henry Winkler is also on board,Varietyreported on Tuesday (March 4).\nSeveral scenes were filmed at last year’s Rolling Loud Miami, with production already underway in Atlanta.

For one, it’s R-rated, so hopefully, the film won’t be watered down for a mainstream audience. Then there’s the star-studded cast, which opens up the possibility for more surprise cameos.\nWilson’s past work notably includesWedding Crasherswith Vince Vaughn, theZoolanderseries and the martial arts-packed western comedyShanghai Noon.\nThoughRolling Louddoesn’t have an exact release date, we know it is set to be released sometime in 2026. In the meantime, the festival itself is gearing up for astop at Inglewood’s Hollywood Park Groundson March 15 and 16. ASAP Rocky will headline night one, while Playboi Carti takes the stage for night two. The lineup also includes Sexyy Red, YG, Ski Mask The Slump God, Ken Carson, Blxst and more.\nAs usual, Rolling Loud is expected to make its way back to Miami toward the tail end of the year.

On Monday (March 17) night, the biggest names in music gathered at Los Angeles’ Dolby Theater, with GloRilla, SZA, BossMan Dlow and many more taking home awards.\nStarting with the coveted Hip Hop Artist of the Year Award, GloRilla came out victorious among her stiff competition. The “TGIF” rapper was up against Travis Scott, Drake, Future and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of the Compton native, his “Not Like Us” — which saw five Grammy Award wins back in February — nabbed Hip Hop Song of the Year.\nAs for the genre’s Best New Artist category, BossMan Dlow became a first-time winner. Also vying for the award were “rock your hips” hitmaker 310babii, BigXthaPlug, sexy drill front-runner Cash Cobain and Jordan Adetunji, who was seemingly placed in the wrong nomination pool to begin with. The London-born singer blew up with the mega-viral “KEHLANI,” so one of the R&B categories likely would’ve been more fitting.\nWhen it came to R&B Artist of the Year, SZA secured the well-earned title following her chart-toppingLANArelease and Lamar’s Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show. She beat out Usher, Chris Brown, Muni Long and Victoria Monét — all of whom had incredible runs last year.\nBest New Artist for R&B went to4batz, the Dallas crooner who won many of us over with 2023’s “act ii: date @ 8” and subsequent singles like “act iii: on god? (she like)” and “roll da dice.” Meanwhile, Muni Long took home the R&B Song of the Year award for “Made For Me,” one of the many ballads TikTok couldn’t get enough of in 2024.\nIt’s not often that artists outside of the usual mainstream favorites get their flowers at major award shows, but the 2025 iHeartRadio Music Awards, fortunately, gave them their due shine. Take a look at all the Hip Hop and R&B winners below.\n“Like That” – Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar\n“Lovin On Me” – Jack Harlow\n“Not Like Us” – Kendrick Lamar (Winner)\n“Rich Baby Daddy” – Drake featuring Sexyy Red and SZA\n“TGIF” – GloRilla\nDrake\nFuture\nGloRilla (Winner)\nKendrick Lamar\nTravis Scott\n310babii\nBigXthaPlug\nBossMan Dlow (Winner)\nCash Cobain\nJordan Adetunji\n“ICU” – Coco Jones\n“Made For Me” – Muni Long (Winner)\n“Sensational” – Chris Brown featuring Davido and Lojay\n“Water” – Tyla\n“WY@” – Brent Faiyaz\nChris Brown\nMuni Long\nSZA (Winner)\nUsher\nVictoria Monét\n4batz (Winner)\nAmbré\nInayah\nJosh X\nMaeta",

[Drake’s] complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.”\nIt’s worth mentioning that the filing opened with a quote from Drake’s 2009 classic, “Successful”: “Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it / Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it.” If nothing else, the label’s lawyers knew how to make the 32-page legal document at least somewhat entertaining.\nIn their response, the attorneys argued that “Not Like Us” falls under “chilling legitimate artistic expression safeguarded by the First Amendment.” They also zeroed in on the visual companion’s “exaggerated imagery,” which notably saw Lamar smashing an owl-shaped piñata and whispering to a clown that he sees “dead people.”",

It is watching Black artists with massive platforms recycle the same tired attacks on Black movements while ignoring the actual systems killing us,” they continued. “Black Lives Matter has supported Black families who have lost loved ones topolice violence. We have built programs, funded mutual aid, and fought in courtrooms and on the streets to protect our people.\"\n“They had bought mansions, and you probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about Black people and don't follow Black news,\" Lil Yachty told Blackwell during the airing. While it’s true that the organization purchased a 6,500-square-foot California property for $6 million in 2020, the space, according toAP News, was intended as a “refuge for those grieving loved ones killed in incidents of police violence.”\nAs for his other claims, the \"One Night” artist might want to bring some actual evidence next time — let alone pick a more fitting platform to make them — before taking aim at the movement again.\nControversy aside, Lil Yachty’s “Feeding Starving Celebrities” was arguably one of the most entertaining we’ve gotten so far, largely due to his long history with Blackwell.

Letting her honey-hued vocals shine through and through, she continued, “You ain’t even worth it, got me out here looking crazy/ I shouldn’t have ignored all the signs/ You wasted all my time, know you gonna miss all of the times that we had shared.”\nToward the verse’s end, she reaches the conclusion that there’s only one Chlöe in the world and all the other women “never could compare.” The “Have Mercy” singer has remainedrelatively tight-lipped about her dating lifesince stepping out with Burna Boy last December, so leave it to the internet to speculate who the verse is aimed at.

The visual effort has over 5.4 million YouTube views in the month since its debut, with even more impressions on social media after fans caught wind of their on-screen chemistry.\nOn Thursday (March 13), during an interview withBillboard, the East London-born singer spoke about enlisting Kehlani for the remix, opening up for their “CRASH WORLD TOUR,” and much more. “We shot the video the day after the London show,” she detailed. “Both me and Kehlani were sick. It was a tough one to get through, but we did it.”\n“We already had the idea of me being in front of the car, and one-take videos are a running theme for me, so we went from there,” kwn explained. According to her, director Chris Chance envisioned something “[that’s sexy and feels] like you’re stuck in this moment” without the viewer being \"too distracted.\" She continued, \"We decided to shake the Internet a bit and get this song really popping off — and that’s what we did.”\nThe video itself unfolded in a dimly lit room, with the two pacing around a black Ford Mustang Fastback and a Shibari dancer suspended in the background. Around the three-minute mark, they locked eyes and shared a kiss. The rest, of course, is history.",

On Tuesday (March 11) night, State Farm dropped a Super Bowl-worthy extended cut of its “Batman vs. Bateman” commercial, which, much like the name suggests, starred Jason Bateman.\nThe clip opens with Cenat documenting the Joker’s escape just moments before a prisoner transport vehicle comes crashing down on another car. The next scene introduces internet personality Jordan Howlett as Commissioner Jim Gordon, who is shining the bat signal. “Batman?” he asks, only for the “Ozark” actor to step into the frame with his signature deadpan delivery: “Close enough. Bateman. I gotta tell you, the suit really bunches up in the old batcave, if you know what I mean.”\nFrom there, Bateman finds himself on the receiving end of some serious punishment from Gotham’s villains, including the Riddler, Two-Face, Poison Ivy and Catwoman — played by none other than SZA. In almost every instance, except for the moment when the “Snooze” singer lands a brutal kick, the realBatman, whose identity remains a mystery, swoops in to save the day.\n“Go home, Bateman. Do a podcast or something,” the masked hero says, to which the wounded Emmy Award winner responds, “That’s hurtful.” The extended version treats fans to a little more action, with Cenat being strapped to barrels of toxic waste in one of the scenes.

World Tour” — enough for social media to speculate that she was on Ozempic, the antidiabetic drug often associated with weight loss. She eventually shut down those rumors by sharingher actual workout routine, which, for an artist of her stature, isn’t for the faint of heart.\n“B**ch, I'm too lit to be walkin' around / Chanel-y, Prada, Gucci / But today it's Emilio Pucci / He wanna taste me, chase me, choose me / But I'm not a regular smoochie,” Ice Spice continued over a bouncy drill beat, presumably produced by frequent collaborator RIOTUSA.

The “CFWM” rapper said, “Everybody [says] you look good, but then you have the little 5% that’s just like, ‘She looked better when she was fat.’”\nShe added, “I was just referencing [the fact that] you can’t make [everybody] happy. They always got something to say when it comes to women’s bodies.” Now more than ever, the goalpost for women across any genre seems to be constantly moving as it relates to what’s considered attractive or acceptable.\nFor context, Yung Miami appeared on the “Club Shay Shay” podcast on Wednesday (March 19), where Shannon Sharpe asked if she thought society pressures women into getting cosmetic surgery.\nLike many others, she agreed and brought upLizzoas an example: “Everybody was like, ‘Oh my God, she’s so fat.’ She looks so good now. Now it’s like, ‘Oh my God, ew.’ ... Pick a side. What do you want?” Of course, nothing foul was said, though it doesn’t exactly take much for a quote to get clipped, taken out of context and turned into a talking point.",

Not only did the home team walk away with a 124-115 victory at State Farm Arena, but Harry the Hawk also popped out for a surprisingly accurate recreation of Kendrick Lamar’sSuper Bowl LIX halftime show.\nWearing an Atlanta Hawks letterman — a nod to the custom Martine Rose one Lamar sported at the Super Bowl — and a mock pgLang chain, the mascot opened with “peekaboo,” one of the many standout cuts fromGNX. Then came the Drake-aimed “Not Like Us,” where he hit the Compton emcee’s iconic walk from the Big Game and lifted the mic in the air as the crowd shouted, “A minor.”\nNot to mention, there was also an Uncle Sam double, clearly playing off Samuel L. Jackson’s Super Bowl cameo from February. Take a look below.",

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 3.22.2025\nIt’s officially been a year since the rap song that flipped the industry on its head dropped. On Saturday (March 22), Hip Hop took a moment to celebrate the anniversary ofWE DON’T TRUST YOU, Future and Metro Boomin’s joint project that housed Kendrick Lamar’s explosive “Like That” verse — the same one in which he took aim at J. Cole and Drake.\nIn the several diss tracks that followed, it became clear some relationships weren’t bouncing back. Drake, for one, still hasn’t made peace with either Future or Metro Boomin, despite how often they’ve worked together in the past.\nAside from Future and Metro Boomin — who probably were the only ones in on what Lamar was about to do — “Like That” ended up exposing a lot of quiet tension in the industry. Just days after it dropped, Rick Ross was accused of “picking a side” for jamming to the track. His co-sign quickly snowballed into a full-blown diss, with thePort of Miamirapper responding to Drake’s “Push Ups” with “Champagne Moments” in April.\nNAV also got swept into the chaos, having quietly unfollowed theViewscreator around the same time. Meanwhile, The Weeknd seemingly revisited Drake’s attempt to sign him to OVO on “All to Myself,” one of the many pointed offerings onWE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU: “They could never diss my brothers, baby/ When they got leaks in they operation/ I thank God that I never signed my life away.”\nTo many, “Like That” had less to do with the lyricists Lamar called out and more to do with the ripple effect it caused. Artists who had been quiet or riding the fence for years suddenly found their voice. Ultimately, it served as a much-needed reminder that Hip Hop is still a competitive space, and the pgLang founder’s verse pulled some of the biggest names right back into that headspace.",

They used her.”\nIt’s worth mentioning thatInvasion of Privacywas no ordinary debut. The project took home Rap Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammys and spawned the first-ever song by a woman in Hip Hop to be RIAA-certified Diamond, “Bodak Yellow.” On top of that, it housed a plethora of other classics, like “I Like It,” “Bartier Cardi,” and “I Do.”\nIt’s entirely possible that if the 13-track body of work weren’t as strong as it was, Cardi B’s momentum would have faded by now. Then again, she also has one of the most loyal fanbases in rap, rivaled only by The Barbz — and that’s certainly something she’s well aware of. As she put it, “I’m anointed, and I have a real fanbase. [Other artists] come and go, but The Brim is still here and will stay!”\nEven beyond her followers, the mother of three hasn’t eased up on the competition in the years sinceInvasion of Privacy. Whether it’s the Megan Thee Stallion-assisted “WAP,” massively successful “Up,” or her plethora of stellar features — GloRilla’s “Tomorrow 2” and Latto’s “Put It On Da Floor Again,” to be specific — Cardi B is anall-around incredible artistwith a personality people evidently can’t get enough of.\nAs for when fans can expect Cardi B’s sophomore album, she’s promised 2025 several times already. The previous year didn’t go quite as planned, especially with herwelcoming baby No. 3and splitting from Offset. However, it’s safe to say that whenever she does finally decide to drop, the anticipation will be just as strong.",

Clock it,” the Grammy Award winner said in reference to the tired narrative that women only succeed in music because men make room for them.

It is not an agenda; it’s God.”\nTo some, it may seem like Doechii blew up overnight, especially since she doesn’t make the typical “fast bulls**t,” to quote Tyler, The Creator. However, anyone who’s been following her journey knows that the Florida native put in serious work. She went from recording songs like the now-viral “Anxiety” in her bedroom to dropping pandemic-era gems like “Yucky Blucky Fruitcake,” and now she’s fully reaping the rewards of 2024’sAlligator Bites Never Heal.",

The rest comes courtesy of streaming numbers, according toLuminate data, as the Tampa native continues her winning streak from a huge 2024.\nDoechii’s numbers look even better when you think about how quickly music comes and goes in the streaming era. Plenty of albums drop one week and vanish from the conversation the next — deluxe editions and tours included — but Top Dawg Entertainment’s leading ladies seem to have figured it out (see SZA’sSOSreturning to No. 1 nearly two years later).\nNot only did the Swamp Princess parlay her breakthrough moment into a Grammy Award — thanks to a select few festival performances, her tour and the “DENIAL IS A RIVER” skits — but her TikTok-viral “Anxiety” also played a huge part. In fact, adding the song to the extended version ofAlligator Bites Never Healpushed the LP up to No. 12 on the Billboard 200 in March.\nSpeaking of theWill Smith-approved track, “Anxiety” also earned Doechii her first-ever Top 10 entry on the Hot 100 chart. Though it's gradually slipped since peaking at No. 10 in late March, its visual companion, which arrived on April 18, has helped maintain its momentum on the chart.\nIn the coming months, Doechii is expected to take the stage at the inauguralCreate & Cultivate Festival, followed by Lollapalooza and Outside Lands in August, so hopefully the aforementioned project and single keep their momentum.",

In the meantime, watch the Alabama native perform “Gripper” below.",

Sometimes you just see her on an interview or see a paparazzi photo, like, ‘Wait, there goes my Miu Miu f**king jacket! What the f**k? I was looking for that since 2021!’”\nMoments later, ASAP Rocky shared that he’s guilty of raiding Rihanna’s closet, too. “That goes both ways,” he joked. “She has pieces she [doesn't] know that I actually stole.” It shouldn’t really shock anyone, given that we’ve seen him embrace the skirt-over-pants trend, wear a kilt at theMet Galaand push plenty of other fashion boundaries — especially for menswear — throughout the years.\nSpeaking of the Met Gala, which he’sscheduled to co-chairon Monday (May 5), theTESTINGcreator revealed he still hasn’t locked down his look. “I’ma be totally transparent and honest with you, I don’t even know what the hell I’m wearing yet.

Of course, ASAP Rocky has a general vision for what he wants on the red carpet, but, according to him, “it’s not that easy” to actually pull it all together.\nThough he skipped out on the 2024 Met Gala — possibly due to RiRi feeling under the weather — he absolutely delivered during the 2021 and 2023 events.

Just last week he was taken into police custody for allegedly hitting a music producer over the head with a bottle during a nightclub incident in 2023.\nAccording toCNN, Brown was required to pay £4 million up front, with an additional £1 million due within the next seven days. The news network also reported that the Grammy Award-winning singer was ordered to surrender his passport, except for when he needs to leave the country for his “Breezy Bowl XX Stadium World Tour,” which is slated to begin in June.\nBrown reportedly wasn’t in attendance when Judge Tony Baumgartner handed down the ruling, and as of now, he hasn’t been asked to enter a plea. Additional bail conditions include staying at a specific court-approved address, avoiding contact with the alleged victim, steering clear of the Tape nightclub and not “applying for international travel documents,” perBBC.\nAsRap-Up previously reported, producer Abe Diaw filed a lawsuit against Brown following the alleged incident, accusing the singer of hitting him over the head with a Don Julio 1942 tequila bottle at London’s Tape Club. The producer reportedly sustained severe injuries, including cuts to his head, torn leg ligaments and “serious emotional distress and trauma.”\nOmololu Akinlolu — a friend of Brown also known as HoodyBaby — was also charged alongside the11:11artist for the same incident. It’s worth noting that Brown was initially scheduled to return to court on June 13. However, asAP Newsnoted, both artists will now face a judge on June 20.\nAs long as the “Residuals” singer complies with the court’s conditions, it looks like the original stops of his \"Breezy Bowl XX Stadium World Tour\" will proceed as planned. He’s due to open the European leg with a sold-out show in Amsterdam on June 8, then continue the trek with another concert in Hamburg.\nOther major cities he’s set to visit before his court appearance include Frankfurt, two back-to-back nights in Manchester, and Cardiff. Bryson Tiller is expected to join him on the road as a supporting act.",

On Monday (May 19), in a Stake promo, the “Hotline Bling” rapper jokingly brushed off the idea that teams or athletes lose after he puts money on them.\n“I feel like I don’t play sports, so, whether I pick the wrong team or not…,” Drake jokes at the start of the clip. “If I could get out there on the field and win for all your favorite teams, I would, but… Nah, the Drake curse is funny to me, honestly.”\nDrake then backed up his point by mentioning theToronto Raptors’ 2019 NBA Finals win, thanks largely to Kawhi Leonard shooting a buzzer-beater in Game 7. “If there was a Drake curse, Kawhi would have never hit that shot. We would have never beat the [Golden State] Warriors,” the OVO rapper argued.",

On Friday (May 16), District Judge Joanne Hirst ruled he should remain detained without bail over accusations that he struck a music producer with a bottle. The alleged incident took place in a London nightclub back in February 2023.\nAccording toPeople, Hirst decided that his charges were \"too serious\" for a magistrates' court to hear them, so he’ll be headed to Southwark Crown Court on June 13. As for why he was denied bail, the judge reportedly received evidence that proved him to be a \"flight risk.\" Brown could faceup to 16 years in prisonif found guilty.\nIn November 2023, producer Abe Diaw sued Brown over the alleged altercation, claiming that the singer struck him over the head with a Don Julio 1942 tequila bottle at London’s Tape Club. He reported serious injuries, including cuts on his head and torn leg ligaments, as well as “serious emotional distress and trauma,” according toTMZ.\nBoth Diaw and prosecutor Hannah Nicholls have reportedly claimed that the alleged attack was captured on CCTV footage. As previously reported by Rap-Up, the video was turned over to the local police afterward. Diaw supposedly knew Brown for “at least seven” years prior to filing the suit.\n2025 was shaping up to be huge for Brown, especially since he's set to kick off his “Breezy Bowl XX Stadium World Tour” next month. However, now that’s up in the air. If he does, in fact, remain detained until his hearing, the11:11singer will likely miss the tour’s opening dates in Amsterdam (June 8) and Hamburg (June 11).

On Wednesday (May 14), theSorry 4 Whatcreator’s legal team, Unite the People, held a press conference to reveal a statement from bodyguard Bradley James, who allegedly claimed thatKelsey Harriswas the one who pulled the trigger.\nHowever, as Megan’s attorney Alex Spiro emphasized, the matter has already been “resolved in the court of law.\" In a statement toXXL, he said, \"Tory Lanez was tried and convicted by a jury of his peers, and his case was properly adjudicated through the court system.”\n“This is not a political matter — this is a case of a violent assault that was resolved in the court of law,” Spiro added.\nAccording to Lanez’s legal team, James — who reportedly worked for Harris at the time — came forward to say the Canadian singer only got involved to smackthe gunout of her hand. He also allegedly claimed that, at least by that point, she'd already fired three shots at Megan. It’s important to remember that Harris received immunity during the “Say It” artist's trial.\n“In essence, Mr. Peterson (Lanez) never shot anybody. Never even touched that gun. He never even fired the gun,” attorney Walter Roberts stated, perVIBE. “This statement aligns with the statement of the only non-party witness to the case, Mr. Sean Kelly, who at trial testified he saw two women fighting, two men break up the fight, one man grab the other one’s arm, gunshots came from the passenger side.”",

Another image showed the Grammy Award-winning rapper seemingly wearing nothing but a fur coat that looked suspiciously similar to the one the NFL wide receiver wore to the2025 Met Gala.\nThe mother of three also posted a video of a room overflowing with enormous bouquets of roses and massive teddy bears, likely courtesy of Diggs. Meanwhile, a separate clip from the carousel showed her twerking on the yacht while the football player playfully smacked her behind. She captioned the slideshow, “Chapter five... Hello, chapter six.”",

On Wednesday (May 28), the 47th U.S. President pardoned the “Outside Today” rapper along with a handful of other individuals.\n“I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building — as a man, as a father and as an artist. This moment means a lot,” NBA YoungBoy wrote via hisInstagram Storieslater that evening.\nHe continued, “It opens the door to a future I’ve worked hard for, and I am fully prepared to step into this.” NBA YoungBoy also made sure to thank his lawyer, Brittany K. Barnett, for “all [her] hard work to make this possible,” and gave a special shout-out to “pardon czar” Alice Marie Johnson.\nIn December 2024, NBA YoungBoy pleaded guilty to his involvement in aUtah pharmacy drug ring. He was initially facing felony identity fraud and felony forgery charges that were ultimately reduced to misdemeanors. Luckily for theTopartist, he avoided prison time in that case.\nHowever, just one month later, he received a 23-month sentence and five years' probation for two federal gun charges. One of which stemmed from an April 2024 house raid in which authorities found a semi-automatic pistol in his Utah home. The other originated from his 2020 arrest in Louisiana for possession of a firearm. According toThe Guardian, the rapper reached an agreement with prosecutors, acknowledging that he had a handgun while filming a music video in Baton Rouge.\nDespite his legal hurdles, NBA YoungBoy seemed to remain optimistic about 2025. On May 15, he announced his “Make America Slime Again Tour.” The trek is slated to begin in Dallas on Sept. 1 before sweeping through major cities like Los Angeles, St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Nashville and New Orleans. With DeeBaby, EBK Jaaybo andk3billed as supporting acts, the tour is expected to wrap up on Oct. 22 in Birmingham, Alabama.\nIt’s been ages since NBA YoungBoy was last on the road, so he’ll likely have plenty of new material to work with. In March, he releasedMore Leaks, and last year, fans got another full-length drop withI Just Got A Lot On My Shoulders.",

Take Lamar’s \"Grand National Tour\" co-headliner for example; SZA snagged Favorite Female R&B Artist and Favorite R&B Song for “Saturn.” Also representing Top Dawg Entertainment was Doechii, whose “Anxiety” won Social Song of the Year.\nIn the other rap categories, Eminem’s Best Male Hip Hop Artist win shocked some viewers — including streamer Kai Cenat — as he beat Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Future and Tyler, The Creator. The decision raised a few eyebrows, especially considering only one nominee notably won a rap battle in 2024 and landed a Super Bowl performance the next year.

Elsewhere, on the Thundercat-produced “Funny Papers,” Miller reflected, “Yeah, somebody died today, I/ I saw his picture in the funny papers/ Didn't think anybody died on a Friday,” which, coincidentally, is the same day of the week hepassed away.\nProduction-wise, much ofBalloonerismwas crafted by Miller himself, along with frequent collaborators Dylan Reynolds and Taylor Graves, and The Internet’s former keyboardist Kintaro.

He announced the release date after his sold-out birthday show on Saturday (Dec. 7) at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. He has been teasing the new LP on social media for a few months.\nLil Baby has been met with a high level of critique since his public feud with Gunna. The “Bigger Picture” track creator seemingly sent multiple shots at his former collaborator after Gunna took a negotiated plea to be released from prison during theYSL RICO trial. Artists like Boosie Badazz, Future, Lil Durk and many others have also distanced themselves from the “HIM ALL ALONG” recording artist.\nWhile he never came out specifically and name-dropped Gunna, fans believed Lil Baby wascalling out Gunnaon his track “350” when he rapped, “Ain’t never say nothin’ ’bout it, n**ga, you know you a rat.” Gunna shot back on “prada dem” and addressed claims that he snitched when he said, “I set the trend, I'm a trendsetter (Yeah)/ I'm not a rat, still gettin' cheddar (Gettin' cheddar)/ Audemars wrist, timeless (Timeless)/ Certified factory diamonds (Factory diamonds).”",

I love Halle’s voice. Please, omg I loveeeee [it].” The genius of the two artists moved a second user to tweet, “That new Leon Thomas song with Halle is absolutely PERFECT.

Jordan, who plays twin brothers Smoke and Stack alongside actor Woody McClain.\nElsewhere, toward the end of his lone verse, Rod Wave referenced the vampire themes in the Ryan Coogler-directed effort: “If he knew I was a slave to the state/ Go tell him I ain't afraid of ghosts, vampires, whips and chains.” The rapper feels somewhat out of place riding through cotton fields in a Ford Model T, but his music certainly does speak to the “stay-afloat” nature of that era. Watch “Sinners” below.",

Released on Friday (March 28), the bubbling Atlanta rapper teamed up with GloRilla and KARRAHBOOO to make one thing crystal clear: They don’t need a man “for a godd**n thing.”\n“B**ch, I'm up, I'm a cash out queen/ KBOOO too, pretty lil' thing,”Anycia, dressed in a long red fur coat and matching nails, spat early in. A few bars later, KARRAHBOOO kept the pressure on: “N**ga pressed to get me back, say he tryna talk it out/ Runnin' laps around these h**s, it feel like I'm workin' out.”\nElsewhere, on the second verse, GloRilla tells the girls who needed to hear it, “H**, stand the f**k up and stop cryin' 'bout that n**ga/ B**ch, go outside instead of spyin' on these n**gas.” It’s a promising lead-in to Big Nene’s upcomingGangsta Grillzmixtape with DJ Drama, aptly titledGrady Baby.\n“I wanted to make something that really spoke to women standing on their own, not just in relationships but in every part of life,” Anycia described the track toBillboard. She added, “I said, ‘Let me find the most disrespectful women I can to get on this track with me!’”",

It’s their first time on a track together, though the singer and producer has penned for the R&B veteran behind the scenes.\nThe guts of the original song — beat, structure and even the emotional weight — remained mostly the same, but Brown stepped in to take over the second verse. “Baby, I’m a different breed,” he crooned before delivering lines like, “We can take our time, what's the rush?/ You can bring a friend, girl, I don't judge/ You know I'm a freak, got me tryna eat it up.”\nIt’s a welcoming take on the viral track, which previously got the remix treatment from Freddie Gibbs.

One major conversation that continues to bubble up in Hip Hop is about how this new generation approaches sampling. While artists are choosing the right songs — classics that already hold cultural weight — these new iterations often fall short in their execution and creativity. \"Never Need\" is the latest example of how tricky that balance can be.\nLet’s talk history first. Before “p**sy rap” had a label, Khia was already out here pushing the envelope. Her lyrics were sexually free, her tone was raw and her confidence made sure you felt every word. \"My Neck, My Back (Lick It)\" and \"Don’t Trust No N**ga\" are still considered essential records — these anthems don't rely on male approval. In particular, \"Don’t Trust No N**ga\" is loud, aggressive and proudly independent. That’s why \"Never Need\" feels like it had so much potential.

Check out the list below!\nIt has been a while since someone’s introduction into the music industry caused a public debate.4batz’s unique approach to social media and his dynamic digital marketing strategy seems set up with intention from start to finish. The ski-mask-wearing high-pitched crooner uses his street image as the perfect juxtaposition to his music’s subject matter. After garnering major co-signs from artists such as Usher, Drake and Ye, the Texas-raised singer is looking to secure his place within the new era of young male singers. His breakout hit, “act ii: date @ 8,” also landed a lengthy feature from the Toronto hitmaker before the new talent inked an EP deal with OVO Sound. Although he only has one full-length project to date, he has already secured features from one of R&B’s greatest living artists, Usher, on his popular track “act iv: fckin u again (18+).”",

As the first female rapper signed to Top Dawg Entertainment, the Florida-born artist quickly proved she’s a force to be reckoned with. Her fearless versatility, electrifying stage presence and razor-sharp lyricism sets her apart in an industry that thrives on reinvention. Whether delivering rapid-fire bars, hypnotic melodies or playful, genre-bending cadences, the hitmaker has a way of commanding attention. While her solo catalog speaks volumes about her artistry, her guest appearances highlight her adaptability and star power.\nIn a “Studio Sessions” interview, Doechii’s engineer, Jayda Love, took readers through a typical studio session. “She likes to record in the day, and she likes to record her demos herself. It helps her write. She needs to write on a mic, so she’ll record herself,” she explained. “Once she’s confident in the song, she’ll bring it into the studio and then we can load it up from there.”\nFrom turning up the heat alongside Tyler, The Creator on “Balloon” to holding her own next to the likes of Katy Perry and JENNIE, Doechii’s features are scene-stealing moments. With a growing list of collaborations that showcase her range, it’s clear why she’s in such high demand.\nHere are 11 of Doechii’s best guest appearances that prove she is one of the most exciting voices in music today.",

        "description": "BYMalcolm Trapp/ 2.19.2025\nDrake’s climb back into the limelight has not been easy, especially after Kendrick Lamar’s nearly career-ending “Not Like Us.” The diss track made history as the first — and so far, only — one to win five Grammys and top the Billboard Hot 100 three separate times. But beyond the numbers, the “certified pedophile” accusations left a serious mark on Hip Hop’s once golden child, so much so that he later filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group.\nWith all that being said, 2024 did not see Drake at complete rock bottom. Outside of diss tracks like “Push Ups” and “Family Matters,” fans got quite a bit of new music, like the beloved “SOD” and “It’s Up,” one of his and 21 Savage’s better collaborations post-Her Loss. He also went on quite the feature run, flipping Metro Boomin’s “BBL Drizzy” on Sexyy Red’s sophomore project,InSexyy We Trust, and wrapping up the \"It's All A Blur Tour — Big As The What?\"\nWithout further ado, here are 12 ways Drake tried to get back in the public’s good graces after his feud with Lamar.

Thankfully, we’ll get to see more of that on their joint \"Grand National Tour\" in April, which, by the way, will be both of their first time doing all stadiums.

        "description": "BYJon Powell/ 4.18.2025\nFor some of your favorite artists, receiving a co-sign fromDrakeoften becomes a strategic move that can reshape a rising star’s momentum and public image. His influence has helped boost a range of acts — from mysterious R&B newcomers to regional rappers and global stars across languages and genres. Drake’s choices on who to acknowledge reflect his awareness of timing, virality and how to place an artist in front of the right audience.\nSome critics view Drake nods as mutually beneficial at best or opportunistic at worst. There’s a long-standing narrative that he uses these moments to align with rising trends and artists tomaintain his own cultural dominance. However, others could argue that it’s a little of both: While Drizzy extends his brand in the process, his reach genuinely helps launch talent into the mainstream.\nIt’s also worth asking — who co-signed Drake? Before his reign at the top, he was championed by Lil Wayne, who brought him into the Young Money Entertainment fold and gave him a global platform. Before that, lesser-known collaborations with the likes of Phonte and Nickelus F slowly pushed him to the center of multiple rap circles.\nWhether you love him or love to debate him, Drake’s position in music is about more than his chart-topping albums or viral moments. Through those achievements, he’s become a cultural barometer with the power to introduce the next wave to the world. It’s like a cheat code of sorts, or a seal of approval, that can turn a bubbling regional act into a household name and an underdog into a serious contender.\nRap-Up compiled a list of artists whose paths were significantly elevated or even transformed by the 6 God's involvement.",

It was all puppy love and dancing his heart out, and honestly, that’s part of what made everybody fall for him. Fast forwardalmost 20 years, and he’s nowhere near that shy kid anymore. Brown has turned into a full-blown R&B heavyweight, and the way he talks on tracks now? Yeah, he’s grown grown.\nHis cute little flirty lines turned into songs that sound like late-night texts you probably shouldn’t be answering. The “Under The Influence” crooner’s confidence took over the music in the best way. Brown has never been the type to stay stuck in one lane, and you can hear the way he’s leveled up with every album. One minute he’s pulling you in with a love song, and the next he’s talking real reckless — and somehow it all just makes sense.\nWatching him go from teenage heartthrob to certified problem has been a journey. And when it comes to sexy lyrics, Breezy doesn’t play around. Let’s get into some of the lines that remind you exactly why he’s been able to keep a chokehold on R&B for two decades.",

Intimate, vibey and rooted in feeling, his sound carries hints of classic R&B. However, he doesn't lock himself into one genre. Falls knows how to ride a groove without losing the story, and when he strips it all back, his vocals speak louder than any production ever can.\nRather than chasing what’s hot, the Orlando native builds something honest. His music feels fresh, honest and sometimes a little raw. Whether it’s a slow jam or a mid-tempo ride, there’s a quiet confidence to his work that pulls you in.\nFalls isn’t trying to fit into a box.

So, it kind of dives into all of that!\nWhat made you split the project into two parts?\nIt was kind of likea business move, to be honest. The common problem with my fans was that they were always like, \"Hey, we want more music.\" So, I decided [in 2025], instead of giving them an album all at once, [when] later in the year [they’ll] want more music, I'm gonna give it to them in doses — where I give them nine [songs] and then I give them nine [more] later in the year, probably around like August, or some s**t like that.\nIs it going to be a different vibe for the B-side, or are you only breaking up the project to feed your fans’ hunger for new music?\nNah, it's definitely gonna be slightly different. I kind of wrote…the majority of [the first half] by myself. [For] the second half, I was with my boys in Los Angeles for like a month. My in-house producers, Luxury Lane… we kind of all wrote the second half of the album together. So, it's definitely a little different on the on the B-side, but it's still in the world.",

It’s part of what makes him so iconic and, quite frankly, such an entertaining artist to keep up with.\nKeeping that in mind, Rap-Up rounded up 11 times Lil Wayne left us questioning things a bit. Take a look below.\nImagine forgetting some of the greatest albums in rap history, especially when they're yours. While celebrating the 15th anniversary ofTha Carter III, Lil Wayne openly admitted toRolling Stonethat he remembers next to nothing about the series’ early installments. “You could lie, you could ask me [about] such and such song, I wouldn’t even know what [we’re] talking about. So, it holds no significance to me at all,” he told the publication. To his credit, he’s often mentioned that he doesn’t write his rhymes down, so maybe he just used that brain space for something else.",

One track in and suddenly you’re thinking about that one text you never sent or that time you swore you didn’t care but did. The St. Louis native doesn’t sugarcoat anything; she leans all the way into the mess. Insecurity, jealousy, wanting to be chosen, knowing you deserve better but still staying? She’s not afraid to admit it, and that’s why her deep cuts hit different.\nThe songs that didn’t get radio push are arguably the ones that really spill the truth. Some of these sound like pages from her diary while others feel like they were meant only for herself and one other person but we all got to listen in. That’s her gift; she says the things people are scared to say out loud.\nSZA isn’t chasing perfection in these records. She’s honest, even when it means contradicting herself. Her deep cuts hold weight because they’re not polished for approval. If you’re listening close enough, you’ll hear a version of yourself in every line.

One genre thrives on storytelling and bars, the other on choreography and sheer perfectionism. However, in practice, crossovers between the two categories have produced some of the most exciting, chart-dominating music in the last few years.\nThe collaborations have birthed successful remixes like BTS enlisting Megan Thee Stallion for an updated take on “Butter” or Stray Kids hopping on Lil Durk’s Grammy Award-winning “All My Life.” And there are more than enough original hits to choose from, too, be it Jung Kook’s collaborations with Latto and Jack Harlow on “Seven” and “3D,” respectively, or the magic JENNIE and Doechii made on “ExtraL.”\nThat said, the real test for pretty much all of these joint efforts aren’t merely sales or numbers, but who left a mark.

His name carried weight in the city long before the mainstream ever tuned in. He had the melodies, the pain, the truth and the hunger. His mixtapes gave a front-row seat to survival. Chicago had him on repeat, and so did St. Louis, Detroit and Indianapolis. The Midwest knew who he was before the blogs caught up.\nLil Durk’s come up is what it really looks like to grind when nobody’s watching. He stayed loyal to his city and didn’t chase headlines or switch up to get noticed. Even when things got quiet around him, he kept recording like his life depended on it. That hunger paid off. He’s had multiple platinum singles, sold-out tours and chart-topping singles with some of the biggest artists in the world.\nIn the early 2010s, while the music industry was still figuring out what drill even sounded like, he was in it, shaping the sound from the ground up. In fact, he played a key role in pushing the genre beyond Chicago. What started in the trenches turned into a global sound, and Lil Durk was one of the voices leading that charge. Now, he’s charting with the same pain and truth he started with. The industry might call him a star today, but Chicago always did.\nThe drill pioneer’s deep cuts are a reminder of who he was before the fame and how far he’s really come. Let’s get into the ones that tell his real story.",

Each of his albums feels like a layered confession, cultural study and psychological deep dive all at once. Though his most recognizable tracks might’ve sparked chants at protests or played through car speakers worldwide, the true weight of his artistry often lives in the songs that didn’t land on the charts. These deep cuts are often buried at the end of a tracklist or tucked between the singles; however, they’re the records in which Lamar sharpens his questions, wrestles with guilt or directly confronts the contradictions within himself.\nThe \"DNA.” hitmaker doesn’t use filler; every beat, voice shift or pause in his discography has intention. Sometimes, his most impactful bars aren’t even the loudest, either — they’re the ones whispered under layered vocals or spoken through a character. That’s where Lamar separates himself. He’s not simply performing, he’s constructing entire realities, pulling listeners into the mind of a young boy in Compton, a conflicted man of faith or a father navigating generational trauma.\nHis deep cuts are like journal entries we were never really supposed to read, but Lamar leaves them there, open, raw and real.

Today (May 29), the New York rapper debuted a new single titled “Roemello” alongside its visual companion.\n“I’m doing God’s work givin’ jobs to the killers/ Take a drug dealer, turn ‘em into J Dilla/ You n**gas say you mobbin’, but you ain’t a made n**ga,” he spat on the high-energy cut. “I am Harlem Project Pat/ She rub me the same, like Anderson .Paak/ Pull up to my show, but I don’t wanna dap.”\nWhile fans mostly reacted positively to the song, many questioned why ASAP Rocky wasn’t on the final version. Earlier this month, Ferg teased a rendition of the track that featured his “The Mattress” collaborator.\n“This is a joint with me and Rocky. It’s called ‘Roemello,’” the musician said in anInstagram Livesession earlier this year. “Y’all gotta spam Rocky all day and tell him, ‘Let’s drop ‘Roemello.’’ I’m running it back.”",

Elsewhere, Skillibeng lent his vocals to the opening and outro: “Original girl, you are no replica / Smooth, dean, no regular degular / Pretty for real and pretty pon my cellular.”\nWatch the music video for “Jump” below.",
