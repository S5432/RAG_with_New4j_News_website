        "description": "\n3-timeGRAMMY®-winning Hip Hop superstarFutureextends his historicMIXTAPE PLUTOalbum today with the release of his latest official music video for standout song “LOST MY DOG.” The black-and-white feature, directed by collaboratorHenri AlexanderLevy,depicts a reflective and emotiveFutureas he laments the loss of a close friend to a drug overdose. He processes his grief while putting his full emotions into the performance, matching among the most heartfelt lyrics in his catalogue. Watch the music videoHERE.\nAs the song’s subject matter speaks on a critical issue that has not only affectedFuturepersonally, but also many communities far and wide, today he is announcing that he is highlighting the initiatives and educational programs available to communities across the United States from D.A.R.E. America with a donation via hisFreewishes Foundation(freewishes.org).Epic Recordswill also be making a donation to the cause. Alongside this, fans are encouraged to participate in making their own donations to the organization viewing the “LOST MY DOG”s video on YouTube or by visitingdare.org/donate.\n“LOST MY DOG” marks the 6th video to be released offMIXTAPE PLUTO, following “TOO FAST” (here), “TEFLON DON” (here), “TOLD MY” (here), “SKI” (here), and “BRAZZIER” (here).\nMIXTAPE PLUTOwas released last fall to critical acclaim and broke historic records, becomingFuture’s11thnumber 1 album on the Billboard 200 and notably his 3rdconsecutive number 1 album in 2024 following his smash collaborations with Metro Boomin,WE DON’T TRUST YOUandWE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU. The trifecta of releases was the first to achieve the milestone this decade, asFuturebecame the first act to achieve this since The Beatles in 1965-1966, and the first hip hop in chart history. Most impressively, he remains the first solo artist to achieve this chart feat ever, regardless of genre. The fruits of his labor in 2024 paid off in spades, as he is currently nominated for 4 GRAMMY® Awards at the 2025 ceremony with Metro Boomin, forBest Rap Album(WE DON’T TRUST YOU), Best Rap Song (“LIKE THAT” featuring Kendrick Lamar), Best Rap Performance (“LIKE THAT” featuring Kendrick Lamar), and Best Melodic Rap Performance (“WE STILL DON’T TRUST YOU”featuring The Weeknd).\nMIXTAPE PLUTOwas executive produced by 808 Mafia bossSouthside, and co-executive produced byWheezy.A homage to the legendary Dungeon Family and late Rico Wade,MIXTAPE PLUTO’salbum art depicts infrared purple lighting emanating from the windows of the original Dungeon Family house in Atlanta. It is the location of their storied studio, and the basement of Wade’s mother’s home where the legacy ofFuturewas born. It’s a fitting statement: the notably featurelessMIXTAPE PLUTOdistillsFutureto his core essence. It highlightsFuture’sinfluence over the sound of hip hop as a new chapter is written in the career of one of rap’s most inventive and influential wordsmiths. A body of work stripped down to pure, unadulteratedFuture, it’s simply 100% Pluto. It’sMIXTAPE PLUTO.\n\n\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash. All rights reserved.",

His latest project,Microwave Safe EP, is a testament to his artistic vision, combining relatable storytelling with experimental soundscapes. It reflects his desire to craft a body of work that can be appreciated on multiple levels, whether as a casual listen or a rich auditory experience for those willing to explore its layers.

His messaging remains consistent throughout his work: no matter the challenges, it is possible to rise above adversity.\nRiley’s influences are iconic and varied, grounding his artistry in the legacies of some of music’s greatest figures. Michael Jackson’s emphasis on presentation has profoundly impacted how Riley approaches his work, ensuring his music is not just heard but experienced. Nas’s persistence serves as a blueprint for resilience in a competitive industry, while The Notorious B.I.G.’s ability to make the mundane sound extraordinary is a skill Riley has honed in his own storytelling. These influences shine through in theMicrowave Safe EP, where each track feels deliberate, inspired, and finely tuned to resonate with listeners.\nEvery artist faces obstacles, and Riley is no exception.

He began producing his own videos, which led to a deeper understanding of filmmaking. Today, this self-reliance is evident in his multifaceted approach to creating, from music to short films.\n\nRiley’s creative process is rooted in his fascination with sound.

Every verse is imbued with honesty, designed to resonate with listeners on a deeply personal level. This authenticity creates a powerful connection, reminding audiences that they are not alone in their struggles and that perseverance is always an option.\nWhileMicrowave Safe EPis a major milestone, it’s just one chapter in Riley’s artistic journey. A full-length album is already in the works, promising to further showcase his evolving sound and lyrical depth. Beyond music, Riley has ventured into filmmaking, producing two short films that explore comedy and suspense. These projects highlight his versatility and his ability to captivate audiences across different mediums.\nCollaboration is another cornerstone of Riley’s career. His upcoming collaborative album with his favorite rapper and friend Epperson is eagerly anticipated. This partnership reflects Riley’s belief in the power of creative synergy and his dedication to producing work that pushes boundaries.\nAs the CEO/COO of Sound Investment Media, LLC, Riley’s contributions extend beyond his personal artistry. He is committed to fostering a creative environment that supports innovation and authenticity. His work ethic and vision make him not only a talented musician but also a leader within the industry.\nRiley’s journey is a testament to resilience, passion, and the transformative power of art. From shooting his first video at 17 to producing a genre-defying EP, he has consistently demonstrated an unwavering commitment to his craft.

        "title": "Donald Trump’s Presidency: An Astrological Perspective",
        "description": "\nAstrologer Tatiana Borsch\nAs an astrologer, I rely on the stars to reveal the underlying forces shaping key events. I would like to share with you my analysis and predictions regarding Trump’s presidency. This topic is fascinating to me—especially since I hadpredicted his victory, and that prediction has come true. Donald Trump’s presidency offers a compelling case study. His second term as the 47th president of the United States began with astrological signs that foreshadow both triumphs and challenges. Now, let’s examine the dynamics of his presidency, starting from the day of his inauguration.\nThe Inauguration Horoscope: Optimism and Challenges\nThe day of Trump’s inauguration marks the birth of his new administration, and analyzing this chart reveals key tendencies. One thing stands out immediately: Trump’s heavy reliance on his team. The chart suggests that both Trump and his team are optimistic about achieving grand transformations in the U.S., but this optimism may prove fragile.\nVenus in Pisces—a sign governed by Neptune—is at the heart of the issue. Neptune often represents illusions, and Venus’s close aspect with Saturn highlights a clash between idealism and reality. Saturn pulls toward traditional values and limitations. This may indicate conflicts between deception and truth. Uncovering secrets, scandals, and deceptions could become a central theme of his presidency. But this won’t be an easy journey—the established system will resist and actively counteract, and the struggle will be intense.\nHis team consists of dreamers and idealists, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is likely that not everything they envision will materialize. However, in many areas, Trump will see significant progress in advancing his reforms.\nOne key development is the strengthening of U.S. military capabilities, including its nuclear arsenal, as indicated by Pluto’s central position in the inauguration chart.\nEconomic stabilization in the U.S. will be limited in the early part of this year but will become more pronounced in the second half of 2025 and into early 2026. During this period, the U.S. will be in the spotlight, and “Trumpism” as a political movement will give a tailwind to right-wing parties around the world. Trade and economic activity in the U.S. will grow. For Trump personally, this period will also be financially rewarding—it is highly likely that his (or his family’s) fortune will significantly increase. However, all of Trump’s successes will be met with increasingly fierce resistance from the Democratic Party and other opponents. The more he achieves, the stronger this opposition will become, and it may reach intense levels.\nThe most challenging period of Trump’s presidency will be the first half of 2025, particularly up until June. Late March and the last week of April 2025 are particularly dangerous periods for Trump and the United States. During these times, political opposition and external threats could converge, creating volatile situations. Despite Trump’s patriotic intentions to “Make America Great Again,” natural forces and other uncontrollable factors may hinder his plans.\nThe Moon’s hostile aspect with Mars warns of potential dangers for Trump, particularly during travel. His adversaries within the U.S. political elite are numerous, and caution will be essential.\nTrump’s Natal Chart: Optimism, Risk-Taking, and Unwavering Luck\nTrump’s personal horoscope offers further insights into his leadership style and the outcomes of his presidency. As a Gemini with a Sagittarius Moon and Leo Ascendant, he exudes charisma, adaptability, and confidence. His birth during a Full Moon enhances his emotional intensity and dual nature—he can be both a visionary and impulsive.\nHis horoscope reveals the energy of someone who retains a youthful spirit well into old age, carrying the energy of a teenager. This youthful enthusiasm, combined with adolescent idealism and a revolutionary attitude, will be evident throughout his presidency.\nHis Sagittarius Moon imbues him with boundless optimism and a youthful, almost adolescent outlook. This quality, coupled with his Leo Ascendant, makes him a showman who thrives on attention and high stakes. The configurations in his chart highlight artistic talent, dynamic energy, and exceptional luck.\nIn 2024, Jupiter—the planet of expansion and fortune—was perfectly aligned with his Sun and in a favorable aspect to his natal Jupiter, making his electoral victory highly predictable. However, his second term will not be without obstacles.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Trump will need to exercise caution—his enemies, particularly during the first half of the year, will stop at nothing to try to bring him down.\nImmigration, Greenland, and European Discontent\nTrump’s approach to the migrant crisis, especially concerning Latin American countries, will yield some tangible results. While progress will be made, the deeply rooted nature of the problem means that a complete resolution is unlikely.\nTensions with Europe, already visible, will intensify. Trump’s actions could accelerate the process of fragmentation within the European Union, with signs of its potential breakup becoming evident by 2030. His role as a catalyst for this geopolitical shift underscores his impact on global affairs.\nWhile plans to annex Canada will fail, the situation with Greenland appears more promising for Trump. His influence over the territory is likely to grow, and discussions about some form of association with the U.S. could become a reality. Although this is unlikely to happen in 2025, it could materialize between 2026 and 2027.\nTensions with Europe will also grow, primarily over financial and economic matters, including contributions to NATO. Ever the businessman, Trump will push for Europe to shoulder more of the financial burden. However, this pressure will further strain relations, and significant rifts between the U.S. and Europe will widen.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict and China\nTrump’s ambitious claim to bring peace to Ukraine and Russia within a day has already proven unrealistic. A more feasible timeline would be three to four months, but even then, the initial negotiation attempts are likely to fail.\nHe will set conditions that Russia is unlikely to accept, prolonging the stalemate. However, his efforts will help break the deadlock, and by the second half of the year, we can expect a freeze in active hostilities.\nRussia will achieve its objectives, or come close, through military means rather than diplomacy. Trump will have to acknowledge these outcomes, despite his reluctance to grasp the full depth of the conflict. His lack of emotional investment in Ukraine’s fate further complicates matters.\nChina will present another challenge, as it is not inclined to follow the U.S.’s lead. China will continue pursuing its own agenda, likely extending the economic conflict that began during Trump’s first term.\nPluto’s Influence: Destruction and Renewal\nPluto’s return to its position in the natal chart of the United States marks a period of transformation. In astrology, Pluto symbolizes destruction before renewal—tearing down outdated systems to pave the way for new structures. This transit, coinciding with Trump’s presidency, suggests that he could be a conduit for these changes.\nAs the United States experiences a decline in its international influence, this shift may not signal defeat but rather a strategic pivot inward. The nation’s focus may shift from total global expansion to domestic development, with international relations taking a backseat. While this transition could be perceived as a loss, it may ultimately lead to regeneration and a renewed national identity.\nConclusion: A Presidency of High Stakes and Transformation\nDonald Trump’s second term will be marked by high stakes, major challenges, and significant transformations. From economic struggles and strained international relations to internal conflicts and security risks, the road ahead is anything but smooth.\nHowever, Trump’s role as a catalyst for change, amplified by Pluto’s energy, could leave a lasting legacy. Whether this legacy will be seen as necessary disruption or missed opportunities depends on how the United States navigates this turbulent period. One thing is certain: Trump’s presidency will shape the nation’s path for years to come, fostering both reflection and renewal.\nAbout the Author: Tatiana is an internationally recognised astrologer, author of theComplete Horoscopebook series.

        "description": "\nA-Millie Banks is no stranger to hardship. Growing up in the Bronx, he faced the struggles that come with life in an unforgiving environment. But rather than letting his surroundings define him, he found a way out—through music.\n“I used to sit in my room for hours, writing lyrics as a way to just block everything else out,” he recalls. What started as an escape soon became his purpose, setting him on a path to success in the rap industry.\nA-Millie’s style is deeply rooted in the artists who inspired him—legends like Meek Mill, Rick Ross, Nas, and Benny the Butcher. “I saw myself in their stories,” he says. “They weren’t just rapping about money or cars—they were rapping about real life.”\nBut while these influences played a role in his journey, A-Millie carved out his own unique sound, blending the grit of New York street rap with the high-energy beats of the South. The result? A raw, versatile style that resonates with fans from all walks of life.\nA-Millie’s music isn’t just about telling his story—it’s about inspiring others. His lyrics are filled with the realities of struggle but always carry a message of perseverance. Tracks likeNo More TearsandAgainst All Oddsshowcase his ability to turn pain into motivation.\n“I’ve been through a lot, but I never let that stop me,” he says. “And that’s what I want my listeners to understand—no matter what life throws at you, you can keep moving forward.”\nBefore making his mark as a solo artist, A-Millie was part of a group called Richfaam. “That was a big part of my early career,” he explains. “We had our own sound, and I learned a lot from being in that group.”\nBut by 2015, he felt the need to branch out and develop his own identity. “Going solo wasn’t easy,” he admits. “But I needed to find my own voice.” And that’s exactly what he did, creating music that is deeply personal and unapologetically real.\nA-Millie isn’t content with just making music—he wants to change the rap game. “I don’t just want to be another rapper—I want to bring something new to the table.”\nBeyond his own career, he’s also dedicated to helping other artists break into the industry. “There’s a lot of talent out there that doesn’t get the recognition it deserves,” he says. “If I can open doors for the next generation of rappers, that’s a win for me too.”\nDespite his rising success, A-Millie remains grounded. “People can tell when you’re not being genuine,” he says. “I always try to keep it 100, whether it’s in my music or how I interact with people.”\nThis authenticity has earned him a loyal fanbase and respect within the industry. And with new music on the way, A-Millie is ready to take his career to even greater heights.\n“This is just the beginning,” he says. “I’ve got a lot more to say, and I’m gonna keep grinding until I’m at the top.”\nWith his powerful storytelling, undeniable work ethic, and relentless drive, A-Millie Banks is proving that success isn’t just about talent—it’s about perseverance, vision, and staying true to oneself. And if his journey so far is any indication, he’s only getting started.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

I’m still healing right? So it’s something I don’t want to speak about, but I guess I can say I let the music speak for me,” says Coi, whose new project is inspired by true events. “Best way I can vent is through the music.”\nOver the course of her five new tracks, this vulnerability is exemplified by tracks like “Keep It” and “I Hate Your Friends,” where Coi finds herself almost pleading with her listeners to help her make sense of a confounding personal situation, baring her innermost thoughts for an emotional exorcism. Since her debut in 2018, Coi has been unafraid to explore the many facets of her humanity, even as a consistent source of pop hits, andWhat Happened to Foreverepitomizes this notion.\nCoi’s new deal with Epic comes at a time when the New Jersey native appears poised to catapult into another level of superstardom.

        "description": "\nHip-hop thrives on authenticity, wordplay, and storytelling, and“Mr. Millimeter”byM-Hunt featuring Smoke DZA and Ferris Blusaembodies all three. This hard-hitting track blends street wisdom with intense lyricism over a dark, brooding beat, making it a must-listen for fans of underground hip-hop.\nAt its core, “Mr. Millimeter” personifies a firearm as more than just a weapon—it becomes a confidant, a protector, and a symbol of survival. The repeated hook,“I’m having long conversations with Mr. Millimeter”, reinforces the deep connection between the artists and their struggles, where violence, loyalty, and the streets dictate the rules of engagement.\nSmoke DZA opens the track with his signature laid-back yet menacing delivery, blending his street-hardened persona with slick metaphors:\n“I never run from it, I put some ones on it / Make the problems disappear like I undone it (delete)”\nDZA flexes hisOG wisdom, drawing on past experiences while staying ahead in the game. His reference toJungle Cake (a potent cannabis strain)andhigh-stakes hustleshowcases his dominance, making it clear he plays for keeps.\nFerris Blusa comes in with a different energy—witty, unpredictable, and confident. He drops references toObama, Osama bin Laden, and Colin Kaepernick, intertwining political and cultural moments into his verse:\n“Try to keep me out the game, shit remind me of Colin / Got a flow that’ll prolly send Kanye to college”\nBlusa paints himself as an unstoppable force, combining intelligence with a street-savvy mentality. His ability to balance humor with aggression makes his verse one of the most memorable on the track.\nM-Hunt closes the song with afast-paced, raw, and aggressive versethat refuses to hold back. His lines are packed with sharp metaphors and unexpected punchlines:\n“You ain’t Heath Ledger, bruh, so why you so serious? / Bout to make you wish that semi-colon tat was a period”\nHe also nods to hip-hop legends, mentioningSticky Fingaz from Onyx, proving his credibility while blending modern energy with old-school grit. His confidence and hunger for success shine through, making it clear that he’s here to take over.\nThe instrumental matches the intensity of the verses—heavy bass, eerie synths, and a menacing tempothat amplifies the track’s weight. The beat gives enough space for each artist to dominate, while the hook creates an eerie, almost hypnotic repetition that lingers long after the song ends.\n“Mr. Millimeter” is more than just a track about firearms—it’s a statement of survival, loyalty, and lyrical dominance. Smoke DZA brings his veteran status, Ferris Blusa delivers unpredictable wordplay, and M-Hunt rounds it out with sheer intensity.\nFor those who appreciategritty storytelling, hard-hitting bars, and uncompromising energy, this song is acertified street banger.\n🔥Rating: 8.5/10– Authentic, lyrical, and unapologetically raw.\n© 2025,Variety Press.

His songwriting process is rooted in a deep commitment to lyrical craftsmanship. “I have a robust notes section in my phone devoted to my lyrics,” he explains. “I go lyrics first, adjusting the flow to various beats until I find what sticks and stands out best.” This meticulous approach allows him to craft songs that resonate deeply, combining personal experiences with a broader social and cultural message.\nTrapheauxly’s sound is shaped by an eclectic mix of artists, but none have influenced him more than his own family—specifically his grandfather, the legendary Otis Redding. Beyond this personal connection, his artistic inspirations span multiple generations and styles, including Rapsody, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Mac Miller, Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne, and Kanye West. Each of these artists has contributed to his ability to blend genres, pushing the boundaries of what hip-hop can be.\nLike many independent artists, Trapheauxly has faced challenges in validating his own work within environments that may not always be receptive. “Believing in my own work in invalidating environments has been a challenge,” he admits. However, his approach to overcoming doubt is rooted in persistence and continuous growth. “I consistently work to overcome any doubt I may face by working to improve with every project I put out.”\nOne of his most memorable moments as an artist was the first time he shared his music with his grandparents. His grandmother’s instant recognition of his talent—telling his grandfather that he was destined to be a rapper—served as a powerful affirmation of his path.\nFor Trapheauxly, staying motivated is about embracing life fully. “There is a constant flow of new ideas, and that helps with writer’s block,” he says. “When you can’t create, live.” This philosophy ensures that his music remains fresh, dynamic, and deeply connected to real-world experiences.\nAt the heart of Trapheauxly’s music are themes of love, resilience, and defiance against oppression. His lyrics are more than just words—they are a call to action, an invitation to challenge societal norms, and a celebration of strength in the face of adversity. Through his music, he seeks to inspire, empower, and provoke thought.\nFans can expect an evolution of Trapheauxly’s sound in his upcoming work. Currently, he is developing a project that blends his signature trap-poetic style with experimental elements. The theme? That surreal space between sleep and wakefulness—a sonic journey into the subconscious mind.\nAs he continues to innovate and expand his artistic footprint, Trapheauxly is also spearheading theAtlanta Renaissance, a movement dedicated to revitalizing the city’s artistic and intellectual culture.\nFor those eager to explore his work, Trapheauxly’s music is available across multiple platforms, and his social media presence is a hub for his latest updates and creative endeavors.\n🎶Listen to TrapheauxlySpotify|Apple Music\n📲Follow on Social MediaX|Instagram|TikTok\n🎥Watch His Latest VideosVideo 1|Video 2|Video 3\nTrapheauxly is not just an artist; he is a movement. Through his music, activism, and intellectual pursuits, he continues to redefine what it means to be a modern creator. WithGHETTO POETR¥setting the stage for a bold new era, the world is only beginning to witness the full scope of his artistic genius.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Germany Kent Interviews Mayor Karen Bass On LA Wildfire Management",
        "description": "\nMedia personality Germany Kent attends the 2025 Kingdom Day VIP Breakfast at the USC Galen Center in Los Angeles, California.on February 17, 2025 (C-LEVEL MEDIA GROUP) Photographer Andre David Charles\nGermany Kent has had an impressive career in media by taking on diverse roles, from anchoring the nightly news at FOX to being a public affairs host in West Hollywood, radio personality broadcasting from Inglewood, to primetime TV shows and iconic films in Hollywood, serving as a global media pundit and being a spokesperson for worldwide enterprises, and successfully transitioning from pageant girl to a respected entertainment professional, author, and activist. Her behind-the-camera roles have included producer, director, and writer, for which she is IMDb-accredited. She is also a revered businesswoman and philanthropist.\nAs a pioneering journalist, Ms. Kent has used her platform in the media to spotlight individuals and organizations making a difference and to bring awareness to complex subject matters and attention to current events. Nothing is more pressing these days than the wildfire devastation affecting Los Angeles County. The historic wildfire fallout is top of mind surrounding the backlash over accountability after the devastating wildfires, particularly city leaders’ response to the natural disaster.\nAt the 40th Annual Kingdom Day Parade festivities held on February 17, Kent was granted access to the invite-only VIP breakfast held at the The Galen Center, located at the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles, known for hosting USC Trojans basketball and USC volleyball games, as well as concerts, pageants, and theatrical performances, where she interviewed top city officials.\nIn a behind-the-scenes exclusive interview, Kent spoke with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and got her take on what the city is doing to help those impacted, especially the residents of Altadena.\nIn the video, the mayor says that the city is committed to helping those impacted by the wildfires.\nIn the interview, Kent asked the mayor what it meant to be at the Kingdom Day festivities celebrating the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The mayor was quick to offer up her admiration for the legendary civil rights leader, adding that it was important to move forward with the event, which had to be postponed due to the wildfires.\nThe mayor said, “We’re celebrating the holiday a little late because of the tragic fires that happened.” She acknowledged Black History Month and reflected on how King’s legacy is important. “To be here and to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, to me, just reaffirms and re-energizes our commitment to continue the struggle,” she said.\nBass switches gears to speak on the catastrophic damage to the region and the long road to recovery.”We’ve suffered a terrible tragedy with the pretty much loss of the Altadena community,” she continued, “the loss, the grieving the tragedy, it’s more than you lost a house, you lost history, you lost memories, you lost relationships, because the Altadena community was a tight knit community, as well as the Palisades.”\n“It’s affected all of us in so many different ways,” according to the mayor.\nMs. Kent expressed empathy to the mayor for the loss of her brother’s residence in the Palisades. maintained a hopeful tone and highlighted the potential for rebuilding and recovery.\nConcluding her message, Bass urged unity and determination to move forward, stating, “Our hearts are with them and I know that we’re going to commit and make sure all of those families rebuild.”\nThe mayor acknowledges that she and her team are making progress on the recovery efforts. Her office issued a statement saying, “The Mayor is focused on recovery, which right now is months ahead of expectations, and she is going to continue pushing forward.” Bass has also been touring the city’s four fire recovery centers, where victims can get financial help and job placement services.\nWatch the video here\n\nKent’s interview with the mayor acknowledges not only her transformative impact on storytelling in Los Angeles but also her vision to boost public awareness and hold those in power accountable. By bringing independent reporting to the forefront, her intention is to showcase entire conversations so that people are heard and not just represented by their soundbites.\n“I’m grateful that the mayor granted the interview and made a point to answer my questions,” Kent said. “When I learned that she would take the interview, I was completely shocked. I didn’t expect her to say yes.”\n“I’ve been out volunteering in the community and have seen the politicians avoiding journalists’ questions. Because the devastation is so overwhelming, and it will not be an overnight fix, that makes it a complex issue and complicated process for city leaders, which thereby makes it hard to respond to certain expectations,” Kent said. “The present-day challenges amid the wildfire devastation is taking a toll on peoples’ mental health, and the physical destruction is unfathomable. I believe many victims just want answers to see how to get their situation turned around.”\nKent added, “I am confident that the strong sense of community cohesion with many participating and supporting fellow community members will be the headline later. That said, I believe we’ll look back on this moment to reflect on community resilience and the power to overcome.”\n\nGermany Kent pictured at the 2025 Kingdom Day VIP Breakfast at the USC Galen Center in Los Angeles, California (C-LEVEL MEDIA GROUP) Photographer Andre David Charles\nAlthough she has played a successful reporter on TV and in films, Kent’s real-life work in journalism mirrors art because she has made a name for herself in the field on an international stage.\nKent has made astounding contributions in the field and has been awarded for excellence in journalism at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., for work she shot, edited, and produced. The California-based journalist once won a national award in the same category as theLos Angeles Times. Her writings and syndicated works have been published in outlets such asMSNMalaysia,ForbesIndia,Good Housekeeping(UK),Yahoo FinanceCanada, and many more.\nShe serves as a mentor in the field through her Producing Hopeful Souls initiative that she started over a decade ago, helping to provide cutting-edge training and unique opportunities to help others advance in the media, arts, and entertainment industries.\nAs an example, in 2015, she brought elementary and secondary students to cover the 8th Annual National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Awards Gala, where the students interviewed the likes of Bob Barker, Diahann Carroll, Tavis Smiley, and Joe Mantegna. In doing so, Kent made history by becoming the first journalism teacher and media coach to manage student reporters in that age group to cover the NAEJ Awards, according to the Los Angeles Press Club.\nHer immense contributions have inspired other storytellers and aspiring journalists to report in their communities, on their social channels or start-up media platforms, and she has brought a voice to the voiceless through the media across the country and beyond. She is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading authorities on optimism and self-empowerment. Her efforts and contributions to build a better today and a prosperous future for many is a true expression of Kent’s values, mission and vision.\n\nGermany Kent pictured at the 2025 Kingdom Day VIP Breakfast at the USC Galen Center in Los Angeles, California (C-LEVEL MEDIA GROUP) Photographer Andre David Charles\nAs the wildfires have burned, Kent, a noted philanthropist and fervent supporter of the American Red Cross and other humanitarian aid agencies, has been involved in providing resources and support to affected communities.\nHer leadership has included efforts including rehabilitation, mental health facilitation, and long-term recovery efforts to rebuild lives and communities.\n“This is something that I have never seen in my life,” Kent said. “It is widespread devastation. Those who have been hit hard are demanding immediate solutions. Unfortunately, it is just a hard place right now during this state of emergency,” she said. “The bottom line is somebody has to answer for what has happened because too many lives are at stake, people are hurting, and this is going to be an enormous clean-up.”\nBass has received scorching criticism for her handling of the wildfires, leading many to call for her resignation. The mayor also has faced blowback for seemingly omitting reporters’ questions on social media and ignoring others at news conferences. She was gracious for the chance to tell her unfiltered side of the story to Kent, demonstrating her dedication to the process amid the devastating toll of the L.A. fires.\nThe disastrous numbers from the largest blaze, the Palisades Fire, has burned nearly 24,000 acres in Pacific Palisades and parts of Malibu. The Eaton Fire, located north of Pasadena, has burned more than 14,000 acres and left the community of Altadena in ashes.\nAs of today, at least 27 people have been confirmed dead in the Eaton and Palisades fires. The Eaton Fire is now the fifth most deadly fire in state history.\n“I do not believe that the mayor is at fault for the natural disaster, and I trust that she will structure a successful task force to make critical provisions to streamline rebuilding efforts,” Kent said. “I believe that even though she is facing a critical leadership test, Mayor Bass is going to do everything in her power to make it right,” she said.\nABOUT GERMANY KENT\nGermany Kent is a powerhouse multi-hyphenate artist and transformative leader best known for her influential life and career. She is a renowned journalist who has interviewed hundreds of celebrities, including Oscar, Golden Globe, Tony, Emmy, and GRAMMY-winning performers. She is a recognized agent of change. With over 2,000 inspirational quotes and influential books, she brings a new focus on empowerment. Kent’s impact extends to her community and global status as a social media marketing influencer and thought leader.\nThis article originally appeared on TheCineTalk:https://thecinetalk.com/germany-kent-scores-mayor-karen-bass-interview-on-wildfire-controversy/\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "title": "“I’m Rich” by Kéron Kyle & ROW STACKS – A Powerful Anthem of Self-Worth and Success",
        "description": "\nThe Bronx, New York—a place known for its rich hip-hop legacy—has given rise to yet another powerful collaboration.“I’m Rich”, the latest track from Kéron Kyle and ROW STACKS, is more than just a song. It is a bold statement of self-worth, ambition, and the undeniable energy that fuels those striving for greatness. In an era where wealth is often measured in dollars and possessions, this duo reminds listeners that true riches lie in confidence, resilience, and an unbreakable mindset.\nAt its core,“I’m Rich”is an anthem of self-empowerment. The track challenges the listener to redefine what it means to be rich—not merely in financial terms, but in ambition, drive, and self-belief. Through assertive lyrics and an electrifying beat, Kéron Kyle and ROW STACKS make it clear that wealth is a state of mind, and those who recognize their value are already rich.\nA standout line from ROW STACKS,“When I’m in the room they crowd around, I’m the main attraction. I’m the star you just not in, I’m it!”, encapsulates the theme of self-confidence and commanding presence. His words carry the weight of someone who knows their worth, refusing to be overlooked or diminished.\nThe chorus reinforces this message of abundance:“I’ma keep counting my coins, I’m rich.Bank account stay on point, I’m rich.If I want it then I can afford it, I’m rich.Can’t pick it up, I’ll import it, I’m rich!”\nThese lyrics emphasize the mindset that success comes from within. The idea of being “rich” is not limited to financial success but extends to self-respect, hard work, and the ability to create one’s own opportunities.\nKéron Kyle is no ordinary musician. Their background is as diverse as their artistry, blending multiple cultural influences into a sound that is uniquely their own. As a Two-Spirit, multi-ethnic artist, Kéron Kyle draws from African American, Cherokee, Trinidadian, Venezuelan, and Grenadian heritage. This rich lineage informs their music, allowing them to weave in elements of mysticism, spirituality, and cultural tradition.\nBeyond just being a performer, Kéron Kyle is a producer and lyricist who integrates multiple languages into their craft. By incorporating both ancient and modern dialects, they bring an added layer of depth and universality to their music, making it resonate with audiences from all walks of life.\nROW STACKS isn’t just a stage name—it’s a philosophy. Standing forRejuvenated Observant Wise Strength Trust Always Control Kindness Speaks, his name represents his approach to life and music. He is more than just an artist; he is a mentor and a visionary, dedicated to uplifting his community and helping others achieve success.\nHis storytelling ability shines through in“I’m Rich”, where his words paint a picture of resilience and ambition. His lyrics reflect the struggles and victories of those who refuse to be confined by circumstances. Whether discussing wealth, respect, or personal growth, ROW STACKS’ voice carries authority, making his verses both powerful and relatable.\nWhen two artists with such distinct styles come together, the result is bound to be something special. Kéron Kyle’s spiritual, genre-blending approach combined with ROW STACKS’ grounded, street-smart wisdom creates a track that is both inspiring and infectious. Their chemistry is evident, making“I’m Rich”feel like a perfect fusion of their strengths.\nMore than just a banger,“I’m Rich”carries cultural significance. By embracing their diverse backgrounds and infusing their music with messages of empowerment, Kéron Kyle and ROW STACKS contribute to a larger movement in hip-hop—one that values authenticity over trends, individuality over conformity.\nHip-hop has always been a platform for storytelling, resistance, and self-expression.“I’m Rich”continues that tradition, offering listeners not just entertainment but a philosophy for success.\nWith the buzz surrounding“I’m Rich”, both artists are poised for bigger opportunities. Kéron Kyle continues to push boundaries with their music, blending different cultural sounds to create something fresh and innovative. ROW STACKS, meanwhile, remains focused on expanding his reach, collaborating with other artists, and mentoring up-and-coming talent.\nAs they move forward, their message remains clear: success is not just about what you have—it’s about knowing who you are. And by that definition, they are already rich.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nAtlanta rap surrealistB.U.G Antmandrops “145 mph,” a woozy celebration of fast living out now viaWarner Records. The new single adds to the holistically hypnotic, trippy, and color-saturated world the young artist is building and leads the way to his forthcoming EP,Y’all Ugly, arrivingMarch 21st.\n“145 mph” drops you right into the groove where lo-bit keys pulse, and disembodied voices pinwheel through the ether. B.U.G Antman’s vocals cut through the track, zooming past places he’s been.\nAhead of the release, B.U.G Antman shared his vision for the single. “I’m trying to set a bold tone for my project with this one,” he details. “Showing my vulnerable side. This lifestyle really gets to you sometimes.”\nThe track sees Antman recount his brief flings on the road. As an artist in constant transit, fleeting moments are filled with casual sex and drugs as coping mechanisms, suppressing the perpetual heartbreak he endures in pursuit of his musical endeavors.\nThe “145 mph” video drops B.U.G Antman into one of the many metropolises he mentions, NYC. Even as he walks the streets, overpasses, and subways, the artist is in a world of his own — impeccably styled and working on a joint while the city moves in slow or backward motion. At certain points, it gets markedly strange, with wild zoom-outs that wormhole through windows, crosswalk signals, construction scaffolding, and security mirrors. The POV is entirely his own.\nKeep up as B.U.G Antman picks up speed across 2025.\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nRising to the forefront of Florida’s scene with his sharp sense of humor and neck-snapping flows,1900Rugratis quickly becoming one of the most compelling and unpredictable characters in the modern rap game. After sharpening his skills with freestyles and viral singles for nearly two years, and earning over 150 million streams in the process, the Limestone Creek native sharesPorch 2 The Pent, his highly-anticipated debut mixtape, available now on all platforms viaRemain Solid / 300 Entertainment. Spanning 19 tracks, including the hit “One Take Freestyle” and itsKodak Black-featuring remix,P2TPshows off 19’s considerable skills as it tells the story of his rise from the trenches to the top floor.\nAlong with the tape, 1900Rugrat shares the video for “Way 2 Geeked,” a mixtape highlight. Blessed with an apocalyptic instrumental byEliWTF, “Way 2 Geeked” is an ode to the high life, filled with the off-kilter and out-of-pocket punchlines for which 1900Rugrat is known. Directed byDrewFilmedIt, the video gives a glimpse into 1900Rugrat’s life in Limestone Creek, as he counts his paper and dances on top of the neighborhood’s welcome sign.\nInspired by the high-octane street music he grew up on,Porch 2 The Pentis packed with stadium-sized trap instrumentals, perfectly-suited to 19’s outsized personality. Several tracks on the tape feature production byAkachi, a close collaborator of 19’s all-time favorite artist Chief Keef, whose envelope-pushing fingerprints can be found on songs like “Never Dat” and “Two Tone Maybach.” Other songs, like the recent single“Auntie Ain’t Playin'” ft. Skrillaand the viral“One Take Freestyle,”warp familiar samples into blown-out bangers, unfurling a canvas for 19 to apply his frayed drawl. No matter the backing track, 19 puts his stamp on each instrumental with his bars, unleashing a barrage of head-turning quotables on each song, whether he’s flexing his new Audemar on “Clean N Dirty” or shooting his shot with Taylor Swift on “Way 2 Geeked.” Other songs provide a more reflective mood, like the melodic “LMK” and the closing anthem “Never Be The Same,” which mourns lost friends even as it celebrates new wins.\nPorch 2 The Pentprovides 1900Rugrat with the opportunity to strut his stuff alongside some of the game’s best rappers. On “Cheat Codes,” 19 goes toe-to-toe with fellow Floridian and soon-to-be tourmateBossMan Dlow, his clipped cadences fitting nicely next to Dlow’s stop-start bravado. “Bussin’ Baby” bringsLil Yachtyinto the fold, and on the recent “One Take Freestyle Remix,” 19 and Kodak Black prove to be kindred spirits. Notable among the guests isRickfrmdacreek, one of 19’s closest friends from his hometown of Limestone Creek.\nPorch 2 The Pentis the culmination of a steady rise for 1900Rugrat, as he has established himself as one of 2025’s most exciting new rap stars. His career reached a new level last summer, when he released he “U.O.E.N.O.”-flipping “One Take Freestyle.” Propelled by 19’s snarling delivery, quotable bars, and an electric performance on On The Radar, “One Take Freestyle” went viral, generating over 50 million streams across platforms. The Kodak Black-featuring remix has generated over 2 million Spotify streams and 4 million YouTube views, and hasn’t left YouTube’s trending chart in the 4+ weeks since its release. Last week, 1900Rugrat revealed that he will join BossMan Dlow on his “Dlow Curry Tour” next month, passing through major markets likeAtlantaandToronto, stopping inLos AngelesforRolling Loud CaliforniaonMarch 15.\nBuy tickets to see 1900Rugrat on BossMan Dlow’s tourHERE\n\n\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash.

        "title": "“Blood of Christ” – Jay Bahd, The Game & Joe Young Deliver a Groundbreaking Gospel Anthem",
        "description": "\nIn an era where music often explores themes of wealth, power, and indulgence, Jay Bahd, The Game, and Joe Young have delivered something truly unexpected—a powerful gospel-rap anthem titled “Blood of Christ.” This soul-stirring track is one of the most thought-provoking songs in recent years, blending deeply personal narratives with a strong spiritual message.\nA Spiritual Awakening in Hip-Hop\nHip-hop has long been a space for self-expression, often reflecting the realities of the streets. However, “Blood of Christ” takes a different route, bringing faith and redemption to the forefront. With its deeply introspective lyrics and powerful performances, the song serves as a testimony of personal struggles, divine intervention, and ultimate salvation.\nThe Game: A Heartfelt Confession\nRap legend The Game delivers a compelling verse filled with raw honesty and spiritual reflection. Known for his gritty storytelling, The Game doesn’t hold back as he reminisces about his past in Los Angeles, where survival often meant rolling the dice and staying prayed up:\n“Jesus Piece on my chest / Always believed in God, never needed a vest / I know the opps be watching me, I stay prayed up / Hoping that my Maybach wouldn’t get sprayed up.”\nThese lines highlight his unwavering belief in divine protection amid the dangers of his surroundings. His verse goes further, touching on his upbringing, familial struggles, and the glow of resilience that fuels his faith:\n“Thinking ‘bout them nights when I was in the bed laid up / Mama yelling at me, she was mad that I stayed up / She ain’t understand it back then, she was working late nights / My pops was selling crack then.”\nThe Game’s verse is not just a retelling of his past but a testament to the transformative power of faith. His closing line, “Like Pac and Nip, I got a super glow / That’s why I light one up for them every time they do a show,” pays homage to fallen hip-hop icons while acknowledging his own journey toward the light.\nJay Bahd’s Declaration of FaithGhanaian rapper Jay Bahd punctuates the song with a simple yet profound refrain: “I give myself to Christ.” This recurring line serves as the heart of the track, reinforcing its overarching message of surrender and spiritual rebirth. His verse, delivered in Twi, further grounds the song in cultural authenticity, making it resonate deeply with audiences beyond the English-speaking world.\nJoe Young: A Bold Stand for Truth\nJoe Young takes a more direct approach, addressing societal issues through the lens of faith. His verse speaks to the moral and spiritual decay of the world, lamenting the loss of values and the rise of divisiveness:\n“Let’s pray to God for this wicked world / Ain’t safe for boys and little girls, we running out of time while racism rules the world.”\nHe boldly critiques the manipulation of narratives and the agenda-driven media, emphasizing the need for truth and spiritual guidance:\n“They wanna decide and divide / In a world where the devil ain’t gotta hide.”\nHis words serve as a wake-up call, urging listeners to turn back to faith and uphold traditional values. While his verse may spark controversy, it undeniably adds to the song’s powerful message of redemption and spiritual awakening.\nA Song for the Ages\n“Blood of Christ” stands out as a groundbreaking fusion of gospel and rap, bringing together the street wisdom of The Game, the spiritual resolve of Jay Bahd, and the bold proclamations of Joe Young. At its core, the song is an anthem of transformation, a declaration of faith in a world that often leads people astray.\nWith its gripping verses, heartfelt confessions, and unwavering devotion to Christ, “Blood of Christ” is more than just music—it’s a testimony, a prayer, and a call to redemption. In a genre where authenticity is paramount, this song delivers a message that is as real as it gets.This groundbreaking single is featured on Jay Bahd’s critically acclaimed album entitled “The Return of Okomfo Anokye 2,” which is distributed by Roc Nation Distribution and is currently available on all major platforms.\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/real_jaybahd/\n\n© 2025,Logan.

        "description": "\nLil Master Mayhem is taking the music industry by storm at just 10 years old. Hailing from Greenville, North Carolina, this young rapper is making waves with his positive messages, undeniable talent, and infectious energy. Unlike many artists who rely on controversy to gain attention, Lil Master Mayhem is focused on uplifting his audience and proving that you don’t need negativity to go viral. With record labels watching, celebrities reposting his music, and major performances lined up—including a showcase at J. Cole’s Dreamville concert—he is quickly becoming a name to watch in hip-hop.\nHis love for rap started early, inspired by his dad, his producer Juli, and industry legends like LL Cool J, Jack Harlow, J. Cole, and 21 Savage. Surrounded by music, he developed a unique style that blends storytelling, smooth flows, and energy that resonates with both young and older audiences. He stays away from themes of violence and drugs because he believes that what you speak into existence can become reality. For him, it’s all about keeping it real and setting an example—kids should be kids, having fun and enjoying life without the pressure of trying to prove something negative.\nGoing viral isn’t just about getting views—it’s about getting the right recognition. Celebrities like Anthony Rhyne and Playboy Poppy have already shown love to Lil Master Mayhem, a clear sign that his talent is reaching the right people. With more eyes on him every day, it won’t be long before even bigger names start to take notice.\nDespite his rising fame, school remains a priority. He balances his music career by focusing on studies during the weekdays and dedicating his weekends to music. It’s a disciplined routine, but it’s one that works. As he puts it, he’s giving 100%—and he expects the same level of support from any record label he signs with. While he has yet to make a decision, he knows exactly what he’s looking for: a team that believes in him as much as he believes in himself.\nBeing from Greenville, NC, he takes pride in representing his hometown. Inspired by Petey Pablo and Playboy Poppy, he sees himself putting North Carolina on the map for young rap talent. “Why not me?” he asks, and with the momentum he’s building, it’s a valid question. His music stands out because it carries a message—one that speaks to both kids and adults, a rarity in an industry often focused on fleeting trends.\nBreaking into radio has been his biggest challenge so far, but instead of getting discouraged, he uses it as motivation. The fact that he isn’t being played yet only pushes him to work harder. And with his drive, it’s only a matter of time before the airwaves catch up to what social media already knows: Lil Master Mayhem is a star in the making.\nIf he could collaborate with anyone, he’d choose Jack Harlow, Dee-1, J. Cole, and any artist who puts out positive energy. He respects artists who use their platform for something meaningful and wants to work with those who align with his vision.\nThere’s no slowing down for Lil Master Mayhem. He’s got podcast interviews lined up, an EP and full-length album on the way, and a huge showcase at J. Cole’s Dreamville concert. This is just the beginning for the young rapper, and if his journey so far is any indication, he’s only getting started.\nStay connected with Lil Master Mayhem on social media to keep up with his latest music and performances:\n📺YouTube:Lil Master Mayhem\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "description": "\nThe music industry is constantly evolving, introducing fresh talent that brings unique perspectives and sounds. Among these emerging artists is SyrianG, a singer-songwriter from Carbondale, Illinois, whose deep connection to music and authentic storytelling set her apart. With a style rooted in R&B, soul, and pop, she blends emotional depth with relatable themes, making her music resonate with listeners worldwide.\nFrom her early discovery of her talent to her aspirations for global recognition, SyrianG’s journey is a compelling narrative of passion, resilience, and artistic growth.

        "title": "Sarah Herrera and The Tommy Lasorda Experience: The Punk Rebellion Hip-Hop Forgot",
        "description": "\nIn an era where hip-hop has largely taken over as the dominant voice of rebellion,The Tommy Lasorda Experienceis proving that punk rock still has something to say. Led bySarah Herrera, the Bronx-based band blends theraw energy of classic punkwith the kind of unfiltered lyricism that once made hip-hop dangerous—before mainstream success sanded off its edges.\nBoth punk and hip-hop were born fromoutsider culture, thriving on disruption, social commentary, and a deep distrust of authority. But while much of modern hip-hop has leaned into commercial appeal, punk bands likeThe Tommy Lasorda Experienceare keeping the DIY, no-apologies attitude alive.\nTheir latest album,“A Giant Pinball Going Down The Road”, is asblunt and aggressive as early hip-hop, tackling themes likefame, addiction, and political disillusionmentwith a sharp, sarcastic edge. Songs like“Time To Throw In The Towel”, which repurposes hate comments into lyrics, and“Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied”, which takes on corruption, show a commitment to speaking uncomfortable truths—something hip-hop used to do fearlessly.\nWhile much of today’s rap scene has embracedautotune and luxury-brand flexing, Herrera’s band issticking to distortion, DIY ethics, and good old-fashioned chaos. It’s a reminder of when both punk and hip-hop felt likea middle finger to the system, rather than another marketing strategy.\nThe Tommy Lasorda Experience doesn’t shy away from controversy. Their music isn’t designed forradio airplayorcorporate sponsorships—it’s made for people who still believe music should shake things up. Their sound mirrors the underground hip-hop artists who refuse to conform, staying independent and making music for the streets rather than the charts.\nWith their album set to drop soon, The Tommy Lasorda Experience proves that while mainstream hip-hop may have traded in its rebellion for record sales, punk rock still knows how tokick down the door and set the room on fire.\nFollow The Tommy Lasorda Experience:\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "From Sheerness to Stardom: The Unlikely Rise of M Dot R, Britain’s Dancehall Maverick",
        "description": "On a rainy afternoon along Sheerness beach, beneath a gray sky that makes the Caribbean seem a world away, stands Moses Robert McGeorge better known asM Dot R.Draped in glistening chains and carefully curated threads, he appears simultaneously out of place and perfectly at home, embodying the paradox that defines his remarkable journey.\nBorn Moses Robert McGeorge in Sheerness, Kent, M Dot R’s childhood was anything but easy. Growing up amidst family struggles, including addiction issues at home, he faced adversity early on. At fourteen, Moses was injured during an altercation with his older brother, an incident emblematic of his difficult upbringing. Expelled from school at fifteen and forced into odd jobs, Moses quickly learned resilience. Amidst poverty and instability, music became his refuge, a passion discovered at age ten and never abandoned.\nHow did a white kid from Kent become immersed in Jamaican culture, mastering the vibrant rhythms of dancehall and reggae? The journey began unexpectedly: his older sister’s partner from Saint Vincent introduced him to Jamaican Patois and reggae music at just nine years old. Moses immediately felt a strong connection, listening endlessly to tracks by artists like Shabba Ranks and Beenie Man. Those early experiences planted seeds that would blossom over the years.\nAt eighteen, Moses left Sheerness for Lewisham, London, a thriving hub of Jamaican culture. Surrounded by London’s Jamaican diaspora, he absorbed the nuances of Patois and dancehall, gradually building his identity as an artist. Regular trips to Jamaica further solidified his connection, making the island his second home.\nHis artistic breakthrough arrived in 2017 with a freestyle titled “100 Gyal,” capturing attention both locally and internationally. The track went viral, landing him a spot on Jamaica’s popular TV program,Smile Jamaica, where he won over audiences with his surprising authenticity. That moment in Jamaica marked a turning point: “If Jamaica hadn’t embraced me, I probably would’ve stopped,” M Dot R recalls, recognizing the island as the place that restored his confidence.\nWhile fame arrived suddenly, it wasn’t always kind. M Dot R’s initial exposure brought ridicule along with recognition. Early viral videos, including the track “100 Gyal,” spread rapidly on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, often viewed through a humorous lens by the public. Initially, this attention sent him spiraling into depression. “You can’t fight the whole world,” he admits candidly. “I decided instead to prove myself through my music.”\nAnd prove himself he did. The release of “Turn Bread” transformed his career, skyrocketing him from meme status to genuine stardom. The track went viral, garnering millions of views across YouTube and social media. It wasn’t just catchy it was authentic, filled with unmistakable sincerity that audiences couldn’t ignore.\nIn early 2024, the industry’s validation came when Sony Music signed M Dot R. Shortly after, he announced a high-profile collaboration with legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, cementing his rise from internet phenomenon to respected recording artist. As his reputation grew, high-profile artists—from Popcaan to Sean Paul embraced him, inviting him to perform at major events and further solidifying his credibility.\nYet, fame often brings scrutiny, and M Dot R was no exception. Critics questioned his right as a white Englishman to perform dancehall. His response is clear, heartfelt, and unapologetic: “All I’m doing is sharing something I love,” he says. “I grew up around Jamaican culture; it’s part of who I am.” His connection, he insists, is authentic, respectful, and deeply personal. In fact, Jamaicans themselves largely embrace him for genuinely promoting their culture and traditions.\n“When I’m in Portmore, they love my confidence and respect,” he explains. His acceptance in Jamaica is undeniable proof of the sincerity that defines his music.\nHis passion for Jamaican culture doesn’t stop with music. M Dot R also hosts “Cook and Vibe,” a popular YouTube show that introduces audiences to Caribbean cuisine. It’s another extension of his genuine love for Jamaican heritage, drawing audiences even closer to the authenticity of his persona.\nNow the subject of the forthcoming documentaryWhite Lion, M Dot R’s compelling narrative is being chronicled for global audiences. The film, filmed across London, Kent, and Jamaica, showcases his unique blend of dancehall rhythms, personal authenticity, and cultural respect, capturing the essence of his unlikely journey from local talent to international sensation.\nM Dot R is clear-eyed about his ambitions. Despite the success, he’s not resting easy yet. “I’m nowhere near where I want to be,” he admits. With new singles like “Secure the Bag” on the horizon, and ongoing collaborations including a highly anticipated release featuringSnoop Dogghe remains focused on creating music that resonates deeply.\nHis journey is proof that passion, respect, and authenticity can overcome barriers and defy expectations. He has not only carved out space in a genre traditionally associated with Jamaican artists, but he’s also actively bridging cultural divides, connecting diverse audiences through music.\nM Dot R’s story isn’t simply about fame, it’s a powerful reminder to stay true to oneself, regardless of external judgments or societal pressures. Whether audiences initially encounter his videos with skepticism or curiosity, they’re quickly drawn in by his undeniable talent, compelling personality, and heartfelt respect for the culture he represents.\nFrom Sheerness to the shores of Jamaica, and now to the global stage, M Dot R has become much more than a viral sensation. He’s a symbol of resilience, authenticity, and cultural appreciation, a star whose legacy is still unfolding, one compelling song at a time.\nWritten by LuxxPr\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "title": "Bigg Dame Brings the Chaos and Comedy of the Morning After to Life in Last Night",
        "description": "\nBigg Dame’slatest release, Last Night, is more than just a song—it’s a cinematic experience that taps into a universal moment: waking up after a night of partying, trying to piece together what happened. Based largely on a real experience, the track is a raw, humorous, and relatable reflection of the blurry aftermath of a wild night out. “Sometimes you have a hangover, you might still be a lil tipsy, your vision is still trying to make sense of what’s in front of you, and you might wake up next to somebody you left the club with and don’t even know how y’all got back,” Dame explains. The song’s infectious energy, paired with sharp storytelling, makes Last Night a standout, drawing listeners into its chaotic yet familiar world.\nVisually, the Last Night music video captures this hazy confusion perfectly. Dame worked hand in hand with the director to ensure every frame reflected the song’s essence. The visuals feel like a scene straight out of a movie—intense, mysterious, and comically unpredictable. “Me and the director worked hand in hand on this project. Any idea I had or that he had, we just ran with it— no disagreements at all,” Dame shares. The synergy between the music and visuals brings the story to life, immersing viewers in the disorienting yet exhilarating aftermath of an unforgettable night. Every shot is intentional, pulling the audience deeper into Dame’s world of reckless fun and unexpected surprises.\nBeyond the party-fueled storyline, Last Night highlights Dame’s ability to turn real-life experiences into vivid musical moments. “It’s one of the MANY stories that I have had throughout my life, with many more experiences to come,” he says. The song’s hypnotic production, which Dame describes as “mysterious, like in movies when it’s quiet and intense music starts to build up,” adds to the immersive storytelling. His natural charisma and effortless flow make the track feel authentic, proving that his artistry goes beyond just making music— he’s crafting relatable narratives that resonate with audiences everywhere. He even hints at expanding on the story with a sequel or prequel, depending on what the fans want next.\nMore than just another party anthem, Last Night is a statement piece that sets the tone for what’s to come from Bigg Dame. With a seamless blend of humor, storytelling, and cinematic execution, he delivers a track that not only entertains but also connects on a personal level. “We’ve all been there once or twice or even multiple times,” he says. “Just chalk it up as a memory and be mindful when you are out and about drinking, partying, and having fun.” As he gears up to share even more personal stories through his music, Dame makes it clear—Last Night is just the beginning.\nWatch Last Night Now\n\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "Sly: A Story of Light, Dark, and Resilience in Music",
        "description": "\nIn a world where music often feels larger than life and many artists are presented as untouchable icons, Sly stands as a refreshing reminder that we’re all human. An artist from West Chester, Pennsylvania, Sly brings an authenticity and emotional depth to his craft that resonates with anyone who’s ever struggled, fought, and ultimately found their way back to the light. Not just a regular artist, Sly produces, mixes and writes everything at home which adds a hidden talent to the overall creative and trajectory of his up and coming career.\nSly’s entrance into the music world wasn’t planned or calculated. There wasn’t a master plan or a blueprint to follow. His journey into artistry was personal, born from the need to express the battles he fought within himself. Growing up, life wasn’t easy for Sly. He speaks candidly about facing hard times and wrestling with his mental health, particularly anxiety. For a long time, that anxiety silenced his voice, making him feel closed off and hesitant to fully express himself. But deep down, Sly knew he was meant for more.\n“I have such a human story to tell,” Sly explains. “I’m not an ‘alien’ or a ‘god.’ I’m human, and I fight hard to be who I am and do what I have to do.” His vulnerability and courage to share his journey make him a relatable figure in an industry that often seems distant and glamorous. And it’s that very humanity that sets Sly apart in the music world.\nFighting Darkness to Find the Light\nFor Sly, life has been a constant tug-of-war between light and dark, positivity and negativity. This duality isn’t just a theme in his life—it’s the core concept behind his artistry. His name, Sly, carries the weight of that personal mission: striving to be the most positive person he can be, while acknowledging the moments when negativity takes hold. “It’s like the angel and devil on your shoulder,” he says. “That contradiction of wanting to be good but not always doing it is very human and relatable.”\nThis battle between light and dark shapes not only his personal narrative but also his music. His upcoming album will dive deep into these themes, exploring the concept of balance—how we navigate between the two sides of ourselves and how that struggle can inspire growth, strength, and ultimately, greatness.\nMusic That Moves People\nWhen asked about career highlights, Sly’s answer isn’t about awards, big tours, or chart-topping hits—yet. His proudest moment? Being at a party and hearing people rap his lyrics, seeing firsthand how his music connected with others. “It’s small,” he admits, “but it was evidence to me that my music has the ability to actually touch people.”\nFor Sly, it’s about impact. The fact that his words could find their way into someone else’s life and make them feel something is proof that he’s on the right path. It’s these moments—raw and genuine—that remind him why he does this in the first place. His music isn’t just about the beats or melodies; it’s about giving people a reason to believe in themselves. “I believe everyone has the power to be great,” Sly says. “I want to give people the motivation and confidence to be their truest, most authentic, greatest selves every day.”\nSly is the first to admit that his biggest obstacle has always been his own mind. Anxiety loomed large, making him doubt himself and worry about how others would perceive him. For a long time, he let that fear keep him in the shadows. But eventually, Sly made a choice: he wasn’t going to let his anxiety dictate his future.\n“I determined if I can’t beat my anxiety, I’ll never live my dream,” he says. So, he went to battle with it—and won. Each time he chose to express himself openly and honestly, he found more love and acceptance than he ever imagined. “I can’t believe I was letting the idea of what people will think of me stop me from being me,” Sly reflects. “Getting over that was definitely the most challenging thing for me so far.”\nAnd with that challenge behind him, he’s only becoming stronger.\nWhen Sly looks ahead, he sees big things on the horizon. In the next few years, he envisions himself making waves in the mainstream music world—not necessarily at a Drake level, but in his own lane, shining with his own light. “I see myself creeping into that mainstream light, not like a Drake mainstream light, but an Ian kind of light,” he says, referencing a unique, authentic style of success that fits his vision.\nHe dreams of winning a Grammy one day—not just for the trophy, but to show people that you can remain authentic and grounded, even after achieving major success. Sly wants to be an example, much like LeBron James is in the sports world. “I want to lead by example in the way LeBron does and be an example of what to strive to become. I want to inspire and make people feel.”\nHis aspirations don’t stop there. Sly wants to do it all—the radio interviews, the Nardwuar moment, Genius lyric breakdowns. He wants to see people wearing clothes he’s designed and hear his songs blasting from speakers on street corners. “I could go on all day about my aspirations,” he says with a laugh. “So I’ll leave it here.”\nA Narrative of Light and Dark\nSly’s music is deeply tied to the narrative of balance, of battling light and dark, and finding harmony between the two. His upcoming album is a direct reflection of this theme. It’s an album that promises to explore the highs and lows of life, to pull listeners into the emotional conflicts we all face and offer a way through them. By sharing his story and his struggles, Sly hopes to connect with people on a deeper level.\nHis goal is simple: to make people feel. Whether they’re in their darkest moment or standing in the light, he wants his music to remind them they’re not alone. “Once people start looking inward towards themselves on a mainstream level is when actual change comes to society,” Sly says. “And that’s the true end goal.”\nSly’s authenticity isn’t a marketing strategy or a persona. It’s who he is at his core. He doesn’t shy away from his flaws or past struggles, and he doesn’t pretend to have all the answers. Instead, he leads with honesty, sharing the ups and downs of his journey and showing people that it’s okay to be imperfect. “I’ve fought my way out of the dark and right into the light,” he says. And it’s that fight that fuels his music and message.\nWhat’s Next for Sly\nRight now, Sly is focused on getting his story out there. He’s not using this moment to promote a specific song or album—though that’s coming—but to introduce himself to the world. To let people know who he is, what he stands for, and what his music represents. His upcoming album will dive deeper into the themes of light and dark, offering listeners a powerful and relatable narrative about balance, struggle, and self-discovery.\nIf his past is any indication, Sly’s future looks bright. With a message of resilience, authenticity, and hope, he’s poised to make an impact far beyond his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania.\nConnect with Sly\nSly’s journey is just beginning, and you can follow along as he continues to grow, create, and inspire. Whether it’s through his powerful lyrics, his honest storytelling, or his authentic presence, Sly is an artist you’ll want to keep your eye on.\nCheck out his music and follow his journey here:\n• Apple Music (https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sly-tinez/1640407780)\n• Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/artist/4d2nNrneNVk5Jbc5O7rK5u?si=cUF5Cgn1Rnm8t6asp-hReQ)\n• Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/slytinez?igsh=MTI3M2F0N2h4eDA2dg%3D%3D&utm_source=qr)\n• YouTube (https://youtube.com/@slytinez?si=0Rd5lp72JiXmncST)\nFinal Thoughts\nSly isn’t here to be an untouchable superstar or a mythical figure. He’s here to be real. To share his story in a way that makes you reflect on your own. To remind you that the light is always within reach, even in the darkest times. And through hi\ns music, he hopes to help others find their way—just like he found his.\nIf there’s one takeaway from Sly’s journey, it’s this: authenticity and resilience are powerful. And Sly is living proof of both.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nIn the heart of Brooklyn, a bold new wave of R&B is rising, led by an artist who’s not just shaking up the scene but rewriting the rules altogether. Meet Ashley Robinson, better known as Buttafrossty—a name that’s already becoming synonymous with raw talent, unapologetic authenticity, and a sound that demands attention. Buttafrossty isn’t just another R&B artist; she’s a cultural force whose music pulses with the energy of Brooklyn and a fierce dedication to her roots.\nBorn on December 1st, 1989, in the vibrant borough of Brooklyn, Buttafrossty has always been deeply connected to her community. Growing up in the eclectic neighborhoods of Bed-Stuy and Brownsville/Flatbush, her music reflects the rich mix of cultures, struggles, and triumphs that define her environment.“Brooklyn is my heartbeat,”she says.“It’s where I’m from, and I wear that pride with every lyric. My music is about being real, being unapologetically me, and sharing my story in a way that anyone who’s been through struggle can understand.”\nButtafrossty’s journey into music wasn’t typical. Raised by her late grandmother, she was surrounded by music from a young age, but it wasn’t until high school that she discovered her true calling. After the passing of her grandmother, Buttafrossty was destined to pursue a career in music. It started with freestyling in the halls, battling in cyphers with friends, and eventually finding her voice through writing. What began as playful verses quickly morphed into a powerful form of self-expression. Her music, a potent blend of raw vocals, emotional depth, clever wordplay, and bold lyricism, quickly set her apart.\nWith the release of her latest singles, “Slide” and “OFC” (short for “of course”), Buttafrossty is making waves in the R&B community. Her music is not only being heard but felt, echoing through speakers and playlists worldwide. She also took the R&B genre by storm with latest project “4LetterWord”, which has captured the attention of listeners everywhere, blending smooth melodies with thought-provoking lyrics.\n\nBut it’s not just her music that makes Buttafrossty a game-changer. She’s a voice for the voiceless, an inspiration for anyone who’s ever faced adversity. Through her authenticity, she’s showing the world that no matter where you come from, dreams are within reach.“I want to push boundaries, break stereotypes, and keep creating music that speaks to the heart,”she says.“Brooklyn raised me, and now I’m here to show the world what we’re all about.”\nAs Buttafrossty’s star continues to rise, there’s no question that she’s carving out her own lane in an industry often crowded with copycats. Her fierce lyricism, fearless individuality, and grounded perspective are ushering in a new era for hip-hop and R&B—one where authenticity reigns and everyone has a seat at the table.\n“I’m just getting started,”she says with a smile.“There’s so much more I want to do. I want to create new opportunities, push limits, and make music that moves people.”From Brooklyn to the world, Buttafrossty is making her mark, and the future of hip-hop and R&B has never looked brighter. Get ready—this is just the beginning.\nFor more information on “Buttafrossty”, visit links below:\nApple Music:https://music.apple.com/us/album/4letterword-single/1796909899\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0rKm6p0wZV85JcM96mBOHq\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/buttafrossty/\nYouTube:https://www.youtube.com/@Buttafrossty\n© 2025,Logan.

        "title": "John Monopoly’s Phone Hacked: Leaked Kanye West Video Was Stolen and Is Now Under Investigation",
        "description": "\nLos Angeles, CA – A private video featuring Kanye West confirming his longtime business associate, John Monopoly, was leaked online, sparking controversy over how the footage surfaced. However, sources close to the situation confirm that the video was illegally stolen from Monopoly’s phone, and an investigation is now underway to determine who is responsible.\nThe video, which was never meant for public release, shows a visibly drowsy Kanye West stating, “Hey, this is Ye. John Monopoly does really work for me.” It was recorded as a direct response to Monopoly’s urgent request while he was in the hospital. Monopoly had reached out to Kanye after medical staff allegedly refused to believe his affiliation with the rap mogul. In an attempt to provide proof, West recorded the short clip and sent it privately.\nHowever, shortly after the video was recorded, it began circulating on the internet, leading to speculation about Kanye’s condition at the time of filming. Some critics quickly assumed the worst, while others questioned how such a private exchange made its way to the public.\nTheft of Private Property and Investigation Underway\nAccording to sources close to Monopoly, he never intended for the video to be shared publicly. Instead, his phone was accessed without authorization, and the video was stolen—either by someone within the hospital staff or another third party with access to his device. The breach has raised serious concerns about privacy violations and potential legal consequences for those involved.\nThis situation highlights the growing issue of celebrities and their associates having their personal property accessed and exploited without consent. Kanye West himself reacted with frustration, posting about the situation online, seemingly hinting at the privacy invasion that led to the leak.\nLegal experts suggest that if the culprit is identified, they could face charges related to unauthorized access, data theft, and potential violations of state and federal privacy laws.\nClearing John Monopoly’s Name\nDespite unfounded speculation, John Monopoly did not leak the video, nor did he intend for it to be shared beyond the hospital staff who required verification. The video’s release was a direct result of a breach of his privacy, not any wrongdoing on his part.\nSupporters of Monopoly are urging the public to shift focus toward holding those responsible for the unauthorized leak accountable. As the investigation continues, more details are expected to emerge regarding how the footage was stolen and who may be behind its release.\nFor now, one thing remains clear—John Monopoly is a victim in this situation, not the perpetrator. The real question is, who took the video from his phone, and how will they be held accountable?\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Breaking: Rising New Zealand Artist Jayco Set to Shake the Music Scene with Upcoming Album",
        "description": "\nA new force in the music industry is emerging, and his name is Jayco. The melodic rapper from Palmerston North City, New Zealand, is making waves with his emotionally charged music, and he’s got big plans for the future. With a unique style, a deeply personal storytelling approach, and an unwavering commitment to his craft, Jayco is an artist to watch.\nA Passion for Expression\nFor Jayco, music isn’t just about beats and rhymes—it’s about raw, unfiltered emotion. The rising artist first fell in love with music when he realized it could be his voice for anything and everything. Whether it’s pain, love, or personal struggles, Jayco sees music as his way of expressing what words alone can’t capture.\nThe Sound of Jayco\nDescribing himself as a melodic rapper, Jayco’s sound is dynamic, blending hard-hitting rap flows with soulful, emotional melodies. His music resonates with fans who appreciate deep, heartfelt lyrics wrapped in addictive hooks and vibrant production.\nThe Meaning Behind the Name\nUnlike many artists who carefully craft their stage names, Jayco’s alias came to him organically. His sister-in-law, Bethany, affectionately called him “Jayco” one day, and the name just stuck. “I thought it was hard,” he admits.\nFrom Emotion to Music: The Creative Process\nJayco’s songwriting is deeply personal, often inspired by real-life experiences. His process starts with an idea—usually something happening in his life at that very moment—and from there, he builds a song that captures his emotions in real time.\nOne of his most personal tracks, “All For Mum,” stands as a powerful testament to this. Since he can’t speak to his mother, he poured everything he wanted to say into the song, creating an emotional letter in musical form.\nOvercoming Challenges in the Industry\nLike any artist, Jayco faces obstacles. Writer’s block is his biggest struggle, but instead of stepping away, he adapts—experimenting with new styles or switching genres to keep his creativity flowing. As for criticism? He doesn’t let it faze him. “I know I got something going on, and that’s all that really matters,” he says confidently.\nMilestones and Dream Collaborations\nOne of Jayco’s proudest moments so far has been the release of his debut album, which marked a major breakthrough in his career. But he’s just getting started.\nIf given the chance to collaborate with any artist, NBA YoungBoy tops his list. The Louisiana rapper’s music has played a huge role in Jayco’s life, and he admires his ability to channel emotions into powerful, relatable songs.\nBalancing Life and Music\nDespite his dedication to music, Jayco keeps his priorities in check. Work comes first, but the second he gets home, it’s straight to the studio. His ultimate goal? To turn music into his full-time career and make it his main source of income.\nWhat’s Next?\nJayco is gearing up for his biggest project yet—a brand-new album that he believes will take him to the next level. With big-name artists and producers on board, this project is shaping up to be a game-changer for the rising star.\nAs the release approaches, fans and industry insiders alike are keeping a close eye on Jayco. Could he be New Zealand’s next breakout star? One thing’s for sure—this is just the beginning.\nStay tuned—Jayco is coming.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nAscending with his raw nerve emotionalism and undeniable swagger,DeeBabyis ready to explode out of the Texas scene. Reflecting on his past as he aims to elevate to a new level, the Houston rapper sharesMs. Salazar, his new album. The album is dedicated to Ms. Salazar, DeeBaby’s chosen (non-biological) grandmother, who took him in and nurtured DeeBaby during his childhood, after he ran out of options. Her influence is felt across the album’s 26 tracks, which touch on themes of chosen family, loyalty, and surrounding yourself with people who have your best interests at heart, no matter if they are biologically related. Ms. Salazar makes herself heard on the album’s outro, offering a prayer and kind words for DeeBaby in his present and future.\n“Everybody wants to feel loved, and sometimes it isn’t the person you expect to receive that love from,”says DeeBaby.“I knew that my mother loved me, and I didn’t know my dad, and though I did have a father figure who stepped up, he had his own personal journey to go through before he could be there for me. His mother, Ms. Salazar, isn’t my blood grandmother, but she made me feel like she loved me more than anybody in the world. The fact that she and her family took me in inspires me to this day. This album is dedicated to her, and I worked extra hard on this one to do her proud.”\nMs. Salazaris the most refined conduit yet for DeeBaby’s soulful, Texas-fried sound. The 29-year-old Mexican-American rapper is a gifted storyteller, weaving in tales from his troubled past within his aspirational anthems, his pain echoing through his deeply melodic drawl. The Houston native is an expert flexer, as shown on anthems like “2 Mo’ Cars,” “Private Planes,” and the Kodak Black co-signed “Half A Ticket“, big-upping himself in a way that both silences doubters and expresses wonder at how far he’s come. Despite his tough exterior, he has a knack for romance, showing his sensitive side on jams like “Mírame Baby” and “Ting Ting.” At times, when the pain is almost too much to bear, he channels it into his music, as he ruminates on betrayal on “Changed On Me” and tries to heal his “Permanent Scars.” Eschewing features and presenting 26-tracks of Texas dope, DeeBaby’sMs Salazaris available everywhere viaAlready Platinum / Create Music Group.\nDeeBaby started his rap career in 2021, catching fire with his single“Marz,” racking up over 23 million YouTube views and over 19 million streams on Spotify. “Marz” catapulted DeeBaby to the forefront of the Texas rap scene, presaging a series of successful singles, including “Broken Promises” (14 million YouTube views).DeeBaby’s soulful drawl, tight rhyming technique, and raw lyricism drew the attention ofKevin Gates, who gave DeeBaby his enthusiastic co-sign, affectionately calling him “the Mexican Gates.” Peaking in theTop 10 of Apple Music’s Hip-Hop Albumschart and at#12 on Billboard Heatseekers, 2023’sJunkie Modemixtape was a step forward for the young rapper, racking up over242 million streamsand featuring fan-favorite hits like the inspirational trap ballad “Never Gon’ End,” and the Roxette-interpolating “Listen To Your Heart” (which has over 29 million views in a combo video with “Numb”). Last year, DeeBaby made his mark with theCan You Hear Me Now?tape (#13 on Billboard Heatseekers) and finally connected with his big homie Kevin Gates for the street hit “Millions For My Pain.”\nWithMs. Salazar, DeeBaby asserts himself as one of the South’s most accomplished emcees. Stay tuned for more from the Houston rapper, as he looks to expand his footprint.\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nAtlanta rapperB.U.G Antmanunveils his newEPY’all Ugly, a psychedelic and groove-steeped trip through the aspirations, anxieties, and indulgences of a budding rap surrealist.\nThe immersive project isAntman’smost hypnotic and colorful yet. The tracks zoom through sticky soundscapes, surprising samples, strange interludes, neon highs, and shadowy lows. Our hero is effortless with both melody and rhythm, tumbling bars, and perfectly placed ad-libs.\nOn the previously unheard “Tortoise,”Antmanrides a dark wave of gravity-free synth and skittering drums. Amid the unnerving atmosphere, his voice stays low to the ground, gravelly, as he stays focused on his grind.\nAntmanshared a message to accompany the EP:  “I know the title is a bit confrontational, but there’s a simple explanation! To me, accepting being ugly is analogous to accepting yourself fully and freely, warts and all, because regardless, ‘u gotta love yourself’ — u.g.l.y.”\nSure enough,Y’all Uglyis often focused on winning but also unafraid to explore dark themes.Antmanpreviewed the EP with a pair of singles: “145 mph,” a woozy celebration of fast living that also tapped into the cost and coping that comes with the territory; and “Make Sense,” a lush cut that champions self-expression, intense focus, and getting money. The latter came with a visual rollercoaster of a video (watchHERE) and transfixed tastemakers upon arrival.\nBefore that came the vibrant “Meltdown” — which came with an appropriately drippy video (watchHERE). Throughout, Antman has continued to serve his fans (the “Colony”) music and visuals across his various socials, underscoring his outsized charisma, otherworldly talent, and commitment to an all-encompassing artistic vision. The rising star crawled his way to the top of the new Atlanta scene over the past few years, developing his singular approach across a series of thrilling projects, includingGoats on a Cliff(2020),TrapInfested(2023), andI See Colors(2023).\nAntman hit the gas heading into 2024 with hisBugEP, produced byBakkwoods(SoFaygo, Lil Tecca, Ken Carson), butY’all Uglyis an undeniable level-up the sound of a one-of-one artist coming into his own auteurish vision. Stick around to see whatB.U.G Antmandreams up next.\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Why Astrology Works: 2025’s Predictions Come True",
        "description": "\nBy Tatiana Borsch, Astrologer\nMarch 20, 2025 – International Astrology Day\nDear friends,\nAs we celebrate International Astrology Day on March 20th—the day of the spring equinox, when the Sun enters Aries and a new cosmic cycle begins—I invite you to reflect on the forces shaping our world in 2025. This moment, widely celebrated as Navruz across the Middle East and Central Asia, is far more than a simple festival. It’s a profound tradition, stretching back thousands of years, rooted in the stars and marking the renewal of life as the seasons turn. Here we are, living in an age of dazzling technology and bold visions of the future, yet this ancient practice still whispers to us. I know many wonder how astrology fits into our high-tech, scientific age.\nConsider this: despite advances in physics and cosmology, we still don’t fully grasp what our universe is made of. The Standard Model of Particle Physics, General Relativity, and String Theory offer different explanations, yet none provides a complete answer. Vast portions of the universe—known as dark matter and dark energy—remain largely unexplained. Much of it remains a mystery.\nI don’t claim to outshine scientists, but after more than 30 years as a professional astrologer, I’ve seen how celestial alignments reveal what science still seeks to understand. Let’s test this with myforecast for 2025, published inComplete Horoscope 2025. Now, in mid-March, many early predictions are unfolding. Here’s what’s happening—and what’s ahead.\nThe Stars of Early 2025\nI noted that the first half of 2025—especially January through March—would test us. Jupiter in Gemini, clashing with Saturn, has triggered a battle between old systems and new possibilities. Retrograde Mars (December 6, 2024, to February 24, 2025) has fueled unrest, and March’s eclipse corridor has amplified it all.\nGlobal markets are reeling: the NASDAQ plunged 13.5% over two weeks—this is one of the fastest declines of such magnitude in the last 10-20 years, excluding extreme single-day crashes—while Bitcoin fell 20%. In Germany, a bold new fiscal plan triggered a historic bond sell-off—the worst since the 1990 reunification—affecting fixed-income markets across the Eurozone. These shocks align with my prediction of a “significant worsening” of the financial situation.\nGeopolitics reflects this too. In the U.S., Donald Trump’s return—foretold in my 2024 forecast—has deepened divides and strained ties with Canada and Europe over tariffs. Meanwhile, China’s economy grows, its stocks rising as its influence expands, just as I anticipated.\nCrisis in Conflict Zones\nIn Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky faces his toughest moment. I wrote:\n“The period from December 2024 to February 2025 will be particularly critical for him. His fate remains uncertain, but he may be forced to flee due to mounting accusations from within Ukraine and international sponsors.”\nNow, in March 2025, this prediction is unfolding with striking clarity. The pressure on Zelensky has reached unprecedented levels, driven by three cosmic currents I foresaw. First, the United States—under Donald Trump’s leadership—has turned up the heat. His February 2025 demands, including a push for Ukraine to cede control of its mineral resources in a deal with Russia, have left Zelensky cornered. Second, the Eurozone’s support has faltered, fractured by division among EU nations and a lack of funds to sustain Ukraine’s fight. Third, and most telling, the formal division of Ukraine has begun. Trump’s insistence on a resource deal signals the start of this split—a process I also predicted when I noted that Ukraine could be carved into spheres of influence by 2025. Inside the country, exhaustion and dissent only deepen the crisis. These forces—U.S. pressure, a divided and underfunded Europe, and Ukraine’s division—confirm the stars’ warning of a critical turning point.\nIn the Middle East, the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime has plunged Syria into chaos. Reports of escalating violence confirm my forecast that early 2025 would see worsening tensions in geopolitical hotspots. Even the skies seem to reflect this instability—an alarming rise in plane crashes over the past two months serves as a somber reminder of this turbulent period.\nThe Eclipse Corridor\nMarch 2025 marks a powerful eclipse season, magnifying every challenge. From markets to conflicts, this cosmic spotlight shows we’re at a turning point. But eclipses don’t just bring chaos—they pave the way for renewal.\nA Brighter Horizon\nHere’s the good news, friends: this won’t last. InComplete Horoscope 2025, I promised the second half of the year would bring stability and growth—and I’d love for you to explore thefull forecastwith me. As Jupiter eases its tension with Saturn by mid-2025, economies will recover—slowly but surely. Conflicts will calm, and industries like agriculture, especially dairy, will thrive. Technology will leap forward too.\nFor you, it’s a time of balance—perfect for love, family, and new beginnings like weddings or homes. The stars will reward these early trials with hope.\nTrusting the Stars\nThese events—markets, conflicts, even plane crashes—aren’t random; they’re the universe speaking, as I saw in 2025’s alignments. The mechanism behind astrology remains a mystery, yet it’s worked for thousands of years and still does today. Understanding celestial cycles helps us navigate life’s challenges and opportunities.\nHere’s a curious note: preparing my forecast for Trump’s presidency (Donald Trump’s Presidency: An Astrological Perspective), I noticed his geopolitical ambitions. You may recall how, during his first term, he floated the idea of acquiring Greenland—an idea that sounded far-fetched, even laughable at the time. But it didn’t stop there. Now, in 2025, during his second term, he’s brought it up again, stirring fresh speculation. The stars suggest his ambitions may not be over. I’d say some form of association between Greenland and the U.S. could emerge in the coming years, perhaps during this term of Trump’s. Time—and the stars—will tell.\nOn this International Astrology Day, let’s honor the stars’ timeless wisdom—not because I claim some extraordinary gift, but because astrology, in the hands of those who truly listen, reveals so much. While many study the heavens, few unlock their secrets as this ancient practice does, exploring the quality of time, offering hope, and guiding us through life’s storms with a light that never fades. Curious to test it? Ask today’s AI tools to check these events against my forecasts—you might be surprised how the sky aligns with reality. Don’t shy away from looking beyond modern science; sometimes, the answers are written above.\nTatiana Borsch\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

Captivating listeners all over, “Cardi B” has already garnered significant attention for its infectious beat, clever lyricism, and, of course, its bold title. A name that resonates with hip-hop fans worldwide, “Cardi B” is an ode to the iconic rapper and cultural powerhouse Cardi B.\nThe track also features an exciting collaboration with rising Alabama artist, Bancopee600 who is also signed to Kelo Cash’s label,CRE Records(short for cash rules everything).

        "title": "The Return of JetBoiDaGhxst",
        "description": "\nFrom remixing songs in his bedroom mirror to producing, engineering, and mastering full-length projects, JetBoiDaGhxst has always thrived in evolution. By the time he was 14, he was already deep into music—more fascinated with stereo systems and stacks of CDs than toys. That early passion has since transformed into a self-driven creative path rooted in discipline, independence, and a desire to make timeless music.\n“I’ve loved music since I was a kid,” he says. “While other kids asked for toys, I asked for CDs, a stereo system—anything music-related.”\nGrowing up in Oakland, the signature Bay Area sound was foundational in shaping his early style. “It showed me how to rap and have energy on every song you hop on,” he explains. “I started out making just Bay Area music but then widened my taste and started getting inspired by more artists.” His musical palette expanded to include visionaries like Future, Dom Kennedy, Nipsey Hussle, Bankroll Fresh, A$AP Mob, and Odd Future—all artists known for staying true to themselves while pushing boundaries.\nIn 2024, after a two-year hiatus, JetBoiDaGhxst returned with two powerful releases: his full-length album ReInCarnation and the EP Asura. Both projects marked a creative turning point, reflecting not just a return but a rebirth—shaped by time spent refining his craft, including studying audio engineering at Full Sail University.\n“Those projects meant a lot to me,” he says. “I took the time to reconnect with my roots. I wanted to show everyone that I still had the same energy, but this time, a new and evolved JetBoiDaGhxst had been refining his craft.”\nEach release was self-produced, self-engineered, and self-mastered—a testament to his hands-on approach and steady growth. One standout track, “You Wish,” began as a beat he made just for fun. A freestyle hook followed, and the song quickly became a fan favorite. “Sometimes I write, sometimes I freestyle—it just depends on the song. But with the new stuff, I’ve just been having fun with it.”\nThat independence comes with freedom but also its share of obstacles. Financial challenges, in particular, have been real. “No lie, it was hard for me. I’d travel to LA, pay for studio time, and fund other music business moves. It taught me a lot. I had to get my bag up before I could fully step back into the game.”\nStill, his approach to growth has always been rooted in authenticity. “I just try to be myself. I don’t even bring up my music unless it comes up naturally. People end up discovering it on their own and become part of the family.”\nLooking ahead to 2025, JetBoiDaGhxst is focused and ready. His goal is clear: reach millions and make music that lasts. Whether he stays independent or links with a label remains to be seen—but the mission remains the same. “I just want my music to connect. That’s always been the goal.”\nHe’s got dream collaborations in mind, too. “Pi’erre Bourne,” he says without hesitation. And when it comes to what fans can expect? “A lot of singles, visuals, and live performances. My team and I have some big things in the works we’re keeping quiet to surprise the fans.”\nHe’s had moments that remind him why he does it—like opening for Ramirez in Santa Cruz back in 2017. “Sold-out show. My first stage dive. That night stays in my memory to keep me motivated.” And if music hadn’t worked out? “I’d still be making money somewhere,” he shrugs. “Fulfilling a different purpose.”\nBut music is clearly the calling. “Be yourself and do what you love,” he tells fans. “I just speak about what I live, and I love seeing everyone win.”\nNow based in Florida, JetBoiDaGhxst is tapping into a new energy while staying rooted in California pride. “It’s a different vibe here. I’ve always loved Cali, but I knew I had to leave the West Coast to get where I want to be with music.” As for his favorite artist on either side? He doesn’t hesitate: “Nipsey Hussle.”\n© 2025,Logan.

        "title": "The Underground R&B Revolution That Ignores the “Hits”",
        "description": "\nToday’s R&B isn’t defined solely by chart-toppers—it’s being reshaped by underground producers with bold experimentation and raw emotion. Three pioneering figures—Burial, Neenyo, and Clams Casino—are quietly rewriting the rules, each working from a different corner of the globe.\nIn a modest London studio, Burial turns everyday urban noise into moody, textured soundscapes. With sparse beats, fractured vocals, and atmospheric layers, his tracks like “Archangel,” “Rival Dealer,” and “Ghost Hardware” capture the pulse of a rain-soaked city at night. His work has inspired a generation of artists to explore urban isolation and introspection beyond the polished sheen of mainstream R&B.\nHalf a world away in Toronto, Sean Seaton—better known as Neenyo—crafts a digital blueprint for the modern sound. Eschewing traditional soulful samples, he layers crisp electronic textures with understated melodies. His forward-thinking production can be heard on Drake’s “Plastic Bag” (a collaboration with Future), PartyNextDoor’s “Sex on the Beach” from PartyNextDoor Two, and Future’s “AYE SAY GANG” from MIXTAPE PLUTO. Neenyo’s work bridges digital precision and organic emotion, constantly pushing R&B’s boundaries.\nIn Nutley, New Jersey, Clams Casino is redefining sound with his signature cloud rap aesthetic. His reverb-drenched loops and unconventional twists transform simple samples into expansive, dreamlike landscapes. His influence is best captured on his seminal track “I’m God” and his groundbreaking 2016 album 32 Levels. By blurring the lines between hip-hop and R&B, Clams Casino challenges artists to break from established formulas and explore new sonic territories.\nThough their origins differ, these innovators share a commitment to creative risk-taking. Their music—born in gritty studios and humble setups—has quietly seeped into mainstream playlists, resonating with listeners who crave authenticity and innovation. Their collective output proves that modern R&B isn’t confined to radio-friendly formulas; it’s a genre continually reinvented by those daring enough to blend digital precision with human emotion.\nAs underground tracks influenced by these producers continue to rise, the future of R&B is being written by creators unafraid to challenge convention. Every innovative beat and layered texture is a reminder that true artistic evolution is driven by the spirit of experimentation.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Billboard Success & Global Sound: Inside the Rise of JayForeiign, The Bahamas-Born Hitmaker",
        "description": "Rising Billboard producerJayForeiignis no stranger to standout moments, but his recent projects have pushed him even further into the spotlight. Hailing fromNassau, Bahamas, JayForeiign continues to climb the ranks of the music industry with a unique style shaped by both his Caribbean roots and deep knowledge of American hip hop culture.\nOne of his latest drops—“No Condom”withKey Glock, produced alongside his mentorHoodRich Keem—showcases JayForeiign’s intuitive production skills. “Key Glock just went in the booth and freestyled it in one take,” he recalls, emphasizing the raw energy that fueled the track.\nBut the producer’s most recognized recent release comes in the form of“Baby Drake”, the lead single onNoCap’salbumB.I.D.A. “I made the beat just for him,” JayForeiign shares. “I knew he needed a standout record, and this was it.” The song’s impact affirms his knack for knowing exactly what an artist needs to make a mark.\nFor JayForeiign, inspiration comes from mood, instinct, and a bit of vintage flair. His approach to making music is fluid: “Sometimes I start off with drums, sometimes it’s me just messing around on the piano,” he explains. Recently, he’s found himself gravitating toward older vinyl records—especially fromMotownartists—for sampling and sparking new ideas.\nThis genre-blending curiosity is a signature part of JayForeiign’s workflow, allowing him to craft beats that feel both fresh and nostalgic. It’s a sonic formula that resonates with a wide range of artists.\nJayForeiign’s music is deeply rooted in the lessons he’s absorbed from some of hip hop and R&B’s most iconic producers. He citesSouthside,Metro Boomin,Pharrell,Kanye West, andSpeaker Knockerzas his core inspirations.\nEach of these legends contributes something unique to JayForeiign’s evolving sound. Whether it’s a certain drum loop or melodic pattern, he molds those elements into something original. “I’ve even had the chance to work in sessions with Southside,” he says. “Just watching him work on Future’s album taught me a lot.”\nJayForeiign’s journey wasn’t paved with ease. One of his biggest challenges was breaking out of the local music scene inNassau, Bahamas. “Nobody locally took me seriously,” he admits. But rather than letting that discourage him, he pivoted—hard.\nHe leaned into digital networking, reaching out to artists and managers onInstagram, joiningDiscord beat-making groups, and sending beats via email daily. His hustle paid off.\nAnother personal milestone? Teaching himself how to play the piano. Without a formal teacher, he turned toYouTube tutorialsand learned bits from his sister, who played guitar. These skills added more depth and dynamics to his beats.\n\nOne defining memory in JayForeiign’s career is his first major label placement—withLil Poppaduring the height of COVID-19. “I was just making beats every day with my boy Luhkim,” he recalls. “Then one day, I saw Lil Poppa previewing a snippet of our track on Instagram—it blew up.”\nSoon after,Barolinefrom interscope records reached out to clear the record, and just like that, the track became thelead singleon Lil Poppa’sEvergreen WildChild2. Today, it remains one of the artist’s most streamed songs.\n🔗Instagram: @jayforeiign\n🔗Genius Credits: JayForeiign\nJayForeiign is just getting started. As he continues to collaborate with top artists and shape the sonic landscape of modern hip hop, his roots, resilience, and relentless dedication remain at the heart of everything he creates.\nJayForeiign is fromNassau, Bahamasand is one of the few major producers from the region making waves in the U.S. hip hop scene.\nSome of his notable works include“No Condom”with Key Glock and“Baby Drake”by NoCap, along with a standout track forLil Poppafrom his albumEvergreen WildChild2.\nHe began producing at age 13, teaching himself via YouTube and learning music theory from his sister who played guitar.\nHis sound is shaped by industry icons likeMetro Boomin,Southside,Kanye West,Pharrell, andSpeaker Knockerz.\nHe mainly produceship hop and trap beats, often blending in soul, R&B, and sampled elements from old-school vinyls.\nHis breakthrough came when Lil Poppa used his beat as the lead single for theEvergreen WildChild2album during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "King of Cali Drops New Single “Patrick Mahomes” – A Hustler’s Anthem",
        "description": "\nSan Bernardino, California, has long been a breeding ground for raw, unfiltered talent, and King of Cali is proving once again why he’s at the forefront of the West Coast rap scene. His latest single, “Patrick Mahomes”, is more than just a song—it’s a statement. Inspired by the mindset of making something out of nothing and mastering the hustle, this track cements King of Cali’s status as one of the best songwriters and lyricists in the game today.\nWith a distinct sound and powerful message, “Patrick Mahomes” delivers high-energy bars that reflect the grind, resilience, and championship mentality of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback it’s named after. From the beat selection to the creative process, King of Cali made sure this song embodied the hunger and drive that fuels his career.\nThe Inspiration Behind “Patrick Mahomes”\nFor King of Cali, the foundation of this track comes from a deep-rooted hustler’s mentality. “The inspiration behind this record was making something out of nothing—how to become a real hustler,” he explains. Much like Mahomes dominates the football field, King of Cali dominates the mic with his relentless work ethic and undeniable talent. The song is a direct reflection of that grind, serving as motivation for anyone striving to reach the top.\nA Statement of His Current Place in the Industry\nEvery artist reaches a point in their career where they feel they have something to prove, and King of Cali is making it clear with this single that he’s among the best. “It shows that I am one of the best in the industry when it comes to songwriting and flows,” he states confidently. With a track record of hard-hitting releases and an unmatched work ethic, King of Cali is not just making noise—he’s setting a new standard.\nBreaking Down the Lyrics\nLyrically, “Patrick Mahomes” is a declaration of dominance. “The meaning behind the lyrics is pretty much telling everyone that we are the top dogs in California, and there is no one out here out grinding us or out hustling us,”says King of Cali. The song serves as an anthem for those who refuse to be outworked, sending a message that success is built on perseverance, consistency, and ambition.\nThe Creative Process\nWhen it comes to making music, King of Cali follows a formula that has yet to fail him. “My creative process is pretty much the same with every song. First, I have to find the beat. If I fall in love with the beat, the lyrics come to me—basically, the beat makes the lyrics,” he shares. This organic approach allows him to tap into the raw energy of the instrumental and craft verses that perfectly complement the sound.\nCollaboration with Gentle Beats\nBehind every great track is a producer who brings the vision to life. For “Patrick Mahomes”, that producer was Gentle Beats. “It was a great process. He has a very versatile but still very distinctive sound. Him and I have some more hits to come soon,” King of Cali reveals. The chemistry between the two artists is undeniable, and fans can expect more heat from this dynamic duo in the near future.\nA Preview of What’s to Come\nWhile some artists drop singles as standalone records, “Patrick Mahomes” is just the beginning. “Yes, this single is leading to one of the biggest projects in 2025, with a very similar cadence to this single,” King of Cali confirms. This means fans should gear up for an entire body of work that carries the same intensity, motivation, and high-energy sound that “Patrick Mahomes” delivers.\nThe Fans’ Response\nIf there’s one thing that’s been consistent throughout King of Cali’s career, it’s his ability to connect with his audience. “They love the record. The fans are saying there isn’t that much money music out here anymore, and I give them that void,” he says. In an era where rap music often leans toward melodic or emotional storytelling, King of Cali is bringing back the motivational, get-money anthems that push people to chase their dreams.\nExperimenting with a New Sound\nEven seasoned artists step outside their comfort zones to evolve their artistry. “Yeah, I did. This is the first time I ever tried this sound. It is very different from all my other songs,” King of Cali admits. Taking risks and exploring new sounds is what separates good artists from great ones, and this shift in style proves that King of Cali is not afraid to elevate his craft.\nWhat’s Next?\nIf you thought “Patrick Mahomes” was the highlight, think again. King of Cali is already gearing up for his next release, which he promises will be a game-changer. “I have a very crazy record that is going to be the hottest song of 2025 titled ‘Mmhmm.’ Stay tuned,” he teases. With an undeniable work ethic and a steady stream of new music on the way, there’s no doubt that King of Cali is on a trajectory toward legendary status.\nFollow King of Cali\nStay updated with King of Cali’s latest music, announcements, and exclusive content by following him on social media:\nFinal Thoughts\nKing of Cali’s “Patrick Mahomes” is more than just a song—it’s an anthem for hustlers, dream chasers, and anyone striving to be the best.

        "description": "\nHip hop has always been a platform for rebellion, truth, and resistance, and Lazarus is taking that legacy to new heights. By becoming the first rapper to shoot an official music video at the Pyramids of Giza, he is not only making history but also delivering a powerful message about knowledge, oppression, and the fight for truth.\nProduced by Dr. Zeus, the track carries an urgency that matches its historic setting. The booming instrumental serves as the perfect backdrop for Lazarus’s hard-hitting lyricism, which goes beyond typical rap themes to address deeper societal issues. He calls out government control, religious manipulation, and the suppression of free thought, forcing listeners to question the world around them. His bars dissect the system with precision, as seen in lines like “They want patriotism, that’s satanism, they doin’ through the tax you payin’ or take you to prison”. This is not just music, it’s a challenge to authority.\nLazarus also connects the past to the present, referencing ancient landmarks like Petra, Chichen Itza, and the Roman Colosseum to emphasize the timeless nature of struggle and perseverance. By filming at the pyramids, he symbolically places hip hop in the lineage of great civilizations, proving that rap is more than just entertainment, it’s a force for change.\nWith this historic video, Lazarus is breaking barriers not only in hip hop but in the way music can challenge the system. He is using his platform to inspire thought, question norms, and remind the world that hip-hop is a global movement, just as powerful as the pyramids standing behind him.\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/lazdetroit/\n\n© 2025,Logan.

        "title": "Rapper SKG Speaks Out Against Domestic Violence: A Voice for Women Who Suffer in Silence",
        "description": "\nDomestic violence is a topic that continues to permeate discussions in many circles, from the workplace to the media, but it remains underreported, especially when it happens to women in high-profile industries. In the music industry, where power dynamics, abuse, and manipulation often lurk behind the scenes, many survivors find themselves silenced by fear, control, and societal pressures. One such survivor is rapper SKG, whose personal journey of survival and resilience has become a beacon for women who have suffered abuse, particularly those in the hip-hop world. Through her voice and her story, SKG has not only stood up against the abuse she experienced but has also used her platform to bring much-needed attention to the pervasive issue of domestic violence.\nThe Rise of SKG: A Survivor’s Journey\nBorn Helecia Choyce, SKG (Suge Knight Girl) is an artist who rose to fame in the early 2000s, gaining recognition in part for her connections with hip-hop mogul Suge Knight. Over the years, SKG has carved out her own lane in the music industry, but behind the music and public persona, she was hiding a painful truth. SKG has been a vocal advocate against domestic violence for many years, sharing her personal story to help others who are trapped in similar cycles of abuse. Her battle, however, goes far beyond just surviving her past—she is determined to ensure that her story can be a source of strength for others.For years, SKG has bravely spoken out about the abuse she endured at the hands of Eugene Henley, a music executive and self-proclaimed community activist, better known by the name “Big U.” While Big U is known for his public image and involvement in various aspects of the hip-hop world, SKG’s recounting of their tumultuous relationship paints a very different, darker picture. In 2023, SKG detailed some of the abuse she endured from Big U, including allegations of physical violence and coercion. However, it wasn’t until her appearance on the *No Jumper* podcast in April 2025 that SKG truly opened up about some of the most horrifying moments of her experience, revealing the extent of the danger she faced.\n\nDomestic Violence at the Hands of Big U\nSKG’s experiences with Big U are not only heartbreaking but also chilling. According to her, the abuse began when she was pregnant, with Big U allegedly beating her during her pregnancy.\nThis act of violence, however, was just one piece of a much larger, systemic pattern of abuse, control, and intimidation. During her interview with Adam22 on *No Jumper*, SKG revealed how her abuser, Big U, reportedly went so far as to put out a “hit” on her just last year because she chose to stand up for herself and refuse to remain silent about her suffering.\nWhen Adam22 asked SKG about how she felt after learning that a hit had allegedly been put on her life, she shared that for years, she had been terrified of Big U’s influence and the danger he posed. However, she had reached a turning point. No longer willing to be a passive victim, SKG decided to speak out, reclaiming her voice in the process. “I’m not afraid anymore,” she told Adam22, emphasizing that her decision to speak publicly was driven by her desire to inspire other women in similar situations to do the same. In fact, she hopes her story can empower others to break free from the cycles of abuse that hold them captive, both physically and emotionally.\n\nSKG’s Experience with Nipsey Hussle: A Complicated Legacy\nIn addition to shedding light on her abusive relationship with Big U, SKG also opened up about her complex history with late rapper Nipsey Hussle. During her appearance on *No Jumper*, SKG shared her perspective on how Nipsey, who was once a close friend, played a role in her tumultuous relationship with Big U. According to SKG, Nipsey had allegedly set her up to be physically assaulted by Big U when she was pregnant. While this revelation shocked many, SKG clarified that, over time, she had come to understand that Nipsey Hussle, like many others, had been caught in a difficult situation. She acknowledged that Nipsey, who was younger at the time, may have been coerced or manipulated by Big U, who had a reputation for bullying and extorting others in the industry.\nDespite the pain of her past experiences, SKG emphasized that she did not blame Nipsey for the situation. “He was young and also being extorted and bullied by Big U,” she reflected. This comment revealed a level of empathy and understanding that transcends the bitterness that might come with such a traumatic history. SKG’s willingness to let go of her anger toward Nipsey shows the depth of her character and her ongoing commitment to healing, both for herself and for others who may have been hurt along the way.\nSKG’s willingness to speak out about her experiences with both Big U and Nipsey Hussle is a testament to her resilience and her unwavering commitment to seeking justice for herself and other women who have suffered in silence. Her ability to separate personal feelings from the larger truths of abuse and manipulation in the entertainment industry is a rare and powerful trait, one that sets her apart as a leader and advocate for women’s rights.\nA Commitment to Advocacy: Inspiring Change Through Her Story\nSince beginning to share her story publicly, SKG has made it clear that she is not just a survivor, but a champion for women who suffer from domestic violence, abuse, and bullying. Through her ongoing advocacy, she continues to shed light on the need for safer environments for women in the music industry and beyond. Her platform has allowed her to engage in important conversations about how women, especially those in powerful yet vulnerable positions, can become targets of violence and exploitation. It is evident that SKG’s story goes far beyond seeking justice for her own experience; she is dedicated to using her voice to create a better, safer world for others.\nDomestic violence is not limited to physical abuse alone—it can take many forms, including emotional, psychological, and financial abuse. Women who are caught in abusive relationships often find themselves trapped in a cycle of fear, shame, and guilt. SKG’s decision to publicly share her story is a crucial step in breaking that silence, reminding women that they do not have to endure such suffering in isolation.\nThrough her appearances on platforms like *No Jumper* and her interviews with various media outlets, SKG is helping to raise awareness about the signs of abuse and the importance of standing up for oneself and others. Her advocacy has also helped to remind the public that the entertainment industry, which often glamorizes and romanticizes certain aspects of life, can also be a dangerous and toxic environment for those caught in the wrong hands.\n\nMoving Forward: Reclaiming Strength and Inspiring Change\nWhile SKG’s journey has been marked by struggle and pain, it has also been one of resilience, transformation, and hope. She has turned the trauma of her past into a driving force for positive change, using her experiences to encourage other women to speak up and take control of their own narratives.\nThrough her unwavering commitment to exposing the truth, SKG is inspiring women across the world to rise above their circumstances, reclaim their strength, and break free from the shackles of abuse and manipulation.\nAs SKG continues to tell her story and advocate for the rights and safety of women, she hopes to inspire more women to find their voice and stand up for themselves. Her truth is not just hers alone; it is the truth of countless women who are suffering in silence, afraid to speak out for fear of retaliation, shame, or dismissal. By coming forward, SKG has not only found healing for herself but has also ignited a spark of empowerment for others who have experienced similar hardships.\nIn the end, SKG’s courage to speak out about the abuse she endured serves as a powerful reminder that no woman should ever have to suffer in silence. Her story is one of survival, resilience, and unwavering strength. As she continues to speak her truth and advocate for change, SKG is helping to create a world where women are safe, heard, and empowered to live their lives free from violence and fear.\n\nConclusion\nSKG’s journey from a victim of abuse to a powerful advocate for women’s rights is a testament to her strength, resilience, and commitment to creating a safer world for women everywhere. Her willingness to speak out against the violence she endured at the hands of Big U and other figures in the industry is helping to shed light on the realities of domestic abuse, manipulation, and exploitation within the entertainment world. As SKG continues to share her story, she is not only reclaiming her own strength but is also empowering countless women to find their voice, stand up for themselves, and demand a world where safety, respect, and equality are the norms, not the exceptions.\n© 2025,Logan.

        "description": "\nHYBE America is proud to announce a new distribution partnership with So So Def Recordings, the legendary label founded by Grammy®-winning producer, Songwriters Hall of Famer, and cultural architect Jermaine Dupri. The partnership marks a deeply personal full-circle moment for Scooter Braun, CEO of HYBE America, who began his career under Dupri’s mentorship at So So Def.\n“Everything I learned about the music business started with Jermaine,” said Braun. “He gave me my first shot when I was just a kid with a dream. I was blessed to witness genius up close — and now, years later, it’s an honor to return to where it all began and stand beside him as a partner.”\nThe deal gives So So Def access to HYBE America’s full distribution and marketing infrastructure, empowering the label to reintroduce its powerful catalog and launch new artists, such as DVSN and more, with a modern global reach. With a legacy that helped shape the sound of the ’90s and early 2000s, So So Def is responsible for launching and producing some of the most iconic artists of the last three decades — including Usher, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Nelly, Bow Wow, Da Brat, Jagged Edge, Xscape, and most recently the Grammy®-winning viral sensation Muni Long.\n“This isn’t just a business move — this is family,” said Jermaine Dupri. “Watching Scooter build what he has built has made me incredibly proud. He learned the game inside So So Def, and now he’s in a position to open doors the way I once opened them for him. That’s what legacy is about.”\nFrom his early days as a 19-year old club promoter and marketing executive working under Dupri, Scooter Braun has become one of the most influential figures in music — discovering and managing some of the biggest artists in the world and now leading HYBE America in its mission to shape global culture. But despite the meteoric rise, Braun has never forgotten his roots.\n“Jermaine Dupri isn’t just a legend — he’s one of the greatest producers and executives of all time,” Braun added. “He changed the sound of a generation. This deal is about giving him the modern tools and reach his legacy deserves, and making sure the next generation hears what the last one already knows: Jermaine Dupri is a giant.”\nThe announcement has already sparked excitement across the industry, with many calling the deal a symbol of loyalty, longevity, and the power of paying it forward in an industry that lacks such stories.\nSo So Def and HYBE America are expected to begin rolling out new music under the deal in the coming months, including both legacy releases and brand-new signings, such as DVSN.\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash.

        "description": "\nRising New Jersey artist Kiamo continues to build a powerful movement rooted in authenticity, community, and real storytelling. Fresh off a personal co-sign from King Combs—who reached out and called Kiamo’s music “dope” and expressed interest in working with him—Kiamo is gearing up for a major run in 2025.\n\n\nThe Passaic native is currently locking in on his debut album, a carefully crafted body of work that’s fully produced by two standout producers: SHAHiD13 and Jordan Wade.\nSHAHiD13, a seasoned producer and DJ from Paterson, New Jersey, brings over a decade of experience to the project. His sound is rooted in the culture of Jersey, but his reach is global—having DJ’d throughout New York, New Jersey, Los Angeles, and more. Known for his gritty drums, soulful samples, and musical versatility, SHAHiD13 helps anchor the emotional weight and sonic depth of Kiamo’s upcoming album.\n\n\nJordan Wade, born and raised in Passaic, New Jersey, complements the duo with a more introspective and melodic touch. “Music has always been a big part of my life. Every day I’m inspired to create something new,” Wade says. His style blends classic soul influences with modern textures, giving Kiamo the perfect canvas to tell his story.\nBefore the full album drops, Kiamo is releasing a new project titled “Remember Me at 16” on April 22nd. Inspired by his mindset at age 16, the project reflects a time when Kiamo moved freely, driven by raw ambition, curiosity, and hunger. “It’s about when I was 16 and thinking freely,” he says. “Before the weight of the world really hit.”\nThis release will serve as a bridge between “A Malcolm Story”—his last album—and the highly anticipated debut album. While “A Malcolm Story” introduced fans to his roots and resilience, “Remember Me at 16” zooms in on a younger, more fearless version of Kiamo, setting the stage for what’s to come.\n\nWith major industry co-signs, a hyper-local production team, and a story that resonates beyond city lines, Kiamo is positioning himself as a powerful new voice out of New Jersey. And as always, he stays true to his mission: representing his city, empowering his people, and telling stories that matter.\nApril 22nd, it begins again. And this time, we remember who he was—so we can see who he’s about to become.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nVaughnyxocho returns with a subtle but impactful statement in his new collaboration with Airplane James,She Don’t Love Me—a track that captures the signature energy of West Coast hip-hop with a fresh, introspective twist. As the single gains momentum, Vaughny has also found himself at the center of conversation on social media. A recent TikTok post from his own account, pointing out striking similarities between his past music video and Kim Kardashian’s Mel’s Drive-In SKIMS activation, quickly went viral, sparking dialogue about artistic originality and industry influence.\nBut beyond the buzz,She Don’t Love Mespeaks for itself.\nProduced by J.ioproducedit, the track blends smooth, laid-back production with emotionally grounded lyricism. It’s a song about disconnection—romantic and personal—but the delivery never leans into melodrama. Vaughnyxocho brings a calm honesty to his verses, balancing clarity with vulnerability. His voice carries a subtle grit, like someone who’s made peace with a truth that still stings.\nAirplane James floats seamlessly into the record with a melodic delivery that feels effortless, providing the perfect counterbalance to Vaughny’s introspection. Together, their synergy is evident. There’s no ego in this track, just two artists delivering something that feels honest, unforced, and unmistakably West Coast.\nThe video, shot by BetterMadeCompany and directed by Julian Doster (Milli4Really), mirrors that tone. Rooted in classic L.A. visuals—lo-fi textures, streetwear aesthetics, natural light—the video feels like a love letter to California culture, minus the gloss. It’s raw but stylized, relaxed but intentional. It doesn’t try to prove a point; it simply lets the work speak.\nThe viral TikTok moment adds another layer. In it, Vaughny points out the visual parallels between Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS pop-up and his earlier work—a reminder of how often underground creativity filters upward without recognition. While he hasn’t accused anyone outright, the post sparked a wider conversation about originality, ownership, and the fine line between inspiration and imitation in the content age.\nStill, Vaughny’s focus remains on the art.She Don’t Love Meisn’t about chasing trends or clout—it’s a reflection of two artists who understand their lane and move within it with confidence. In an era flooded with overproduction and empty flexes, this track’s honesty and restraint stand out.\nVaughnyxocho and Airplane James aren’t just adding to the conversation—they’re raising the bar.She Don’t Love Meis more than a moment. It’s a reminder that the West Coast still knows how to keep it real.\n\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

Produced by JKTaps, the track pairs ominous West Coast sonics with a hard-hitting message: authenticity still matters. And for AzSwaye, it always has.\nLyrically,Rap Capis a clear-eyed critique of a culture that often rewards illusion over truth. AzSwaye doesn’t mince words—he calls out the performative nature of mainstream rap and the artists who adopt images for clout rather than expression. His verses hit with sharp realism, grounded in firsthand experience and a deep respect for what hip-hop is supposed to represent. It’s a reminder that while trends come and go, realness is timeless.\nAzSwaye’s flow is as precise as it is evocative. He glides over the instrumental with a sense of purpose, his delivery soaked in West Coast attitude yet refined with a personal, introspective edge. There’s a hypnotic weight to his cadence—confident, deliberate, and unshakably grounded. He balances gruff lyricism with melodic undertones, proving his ability to navigate both aggression and introspection with ease.\nJKTaps’ production sets the perfect stage. The beat is dark, minimal, and atmospheric, carrying a tension that mirrors the content of the track. Haunting melodies float above gritty drums, allowing AzSwaye’s voice to sit at the center with clarity and force. It’s a sound that feels rooted in the streets but elevated in its execution.\nThe visual component, directed by Zammer, adds another layer of depth. Shot with a cinematic eye, theRap Capvideo mirrors the track’s critical tone, capturing stark urban imagery with a refined sense of mood. The camera doesn’t glamorize—it observes, translating AzSwaye’s themes into powerful, atmospheric visuals. Every frame speaks to the disconnect between perception and reality in today’s rap game.\nMore than a return,Rap Capis a reaffirmation of AzSwaye’s identity as an artist and storyteller. A veteran of the “traffic rap” movement, he helped pioneer a sound that blends street detail with melodic experimentation. Over the years, he’s continued to evolve sonically while keeping his foundation intact—never chasing trends, never sacrificing substance.\nWhat sets AzSwaye apart is not just his versatility, but his consistency. Whether delivering cold, streetwise bars or slipping into smoother, more reflective flows, he moves with intention. WithRap Cap, he sends a clear message: in an industry addicted to façades, he’s here to remind everyone what the truth sounds like.\nAs he enters this next phase of his career, AzSwaye isn’t just making music—he’s making statements.Rap Capmarks a new chapter not just for the artist, but for a culture still searching for what’s real.\n\n© 2025,Logan.

        "title": "“Gonzo The Great Takes West Coast Realness Global in ‘Motion'”",
        "description": "\nWithMotion, Gonzo the Great doesn’t just drop a new visual. He delivers a statement. Shot in the gritty, industrial landscape of Wuppertal, Germany, the video is a raw, cinematic meditation on movement, survival, and the mindset it takes to stay solid in unfamiliar territory. It’s hip-hop stripped down to its essence: one emcee, one vision, and a whole lot of soul.\nFrom the jump, the video sets a tone. Moody lighting, graffiti-splashed walls, and late-night silence in a foreign city. There’s no flash, no filter. Just Gonzo in his element, spitting heavy bars over a Zeke Beats-produced track that knocks with West Coast bounce but carries a darker, more introspective edge. This isn’t party music. It’s life music. Each verse feels like a personal journal entry, delivered with clarity and conviction.\nThe most striking thing aboutMotionis how location and lyric come together. Gonzo’s presence in Wuppertal, thousands of miles from his California roots, feels intentional. It’s a clash of cultures, but instead of conflict, it creates contrast. The grimy European backdrop becomes an extension of his message. No matter where you are, the grind doesn’t stop. The camera work matches his cadence. Slow, deliberate, focused. It’s not just about what he’s saying, but how he moves through space. Every tunnel, alley, and rail yard becomes part of his narrative.\nThere’s a certain poetry in watching a West Coast artist carve his name into the streets of a city more known for Bauhaus design than boom bap. That tension, the push and pull between place and purpose, makesMotionstand out. It’s not just another visual drop. It’s an evolution.\nGonzo’s been building a catalog that speaks to his roots and his journey. From early collabs with $tupid Young to linking up with veterans like Luni Coleone, he’s shown range and respect for the craft. ButMotionis different. It feels elevated. Every element, from the beat to the cinematography to the bars, is working toward one unified vision.\nIn an era where visuals often distract from the message, Gonzo flips the script.Motionis proof that simplicity, when executed with heart and focus, hits harder than any special effect. It’s the kind of video that lingers, not because it’s flashy, but because it’s real.\nWith this release, Gonzo the Great isn’t just showing artistic growth. He’s carving out a lane. One where authenticity leads, where visuals serve the story, and where hip-hop can travel far from home and still sound like it never left.\n\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Solo Drew: The Queens Innovator Blending Hip‑Hop, Soca, and Soul Into a Sound All His Own",
        "description": "\nSolo Drew is a rising artist from Queens, NY whose sound is as original as his story. With a choppy flow, island-influenced vocals, and a style that defies comparison, he’s carved out a lane entirely his own. The name Solo Drew reflects that individuality, an artist who doesn’t see many, if any, doing what he does. Music has always been a part of his life thanks to his father, but it wasn’t until age 19 that he took it seriously. Faced with a personal crossroads, he chose his passion over a draining job and hasn’t looked back since.\nHis sound pulls from a wide range of influences, including Hip Hop, R&B, Soca, and Dancehall, shaped by his Caribbean roots and American upbringing. Every track carries a mix of pain, passion, and precision, and his process is just as fluid. Some days start with a beat, other times with a bar or just a vibe. Inspiration comes naturally, drawn from life, the people around him, and the world at large. While he’s always evolving, Drew admits he’s his own biggest critic and rarely feels like a song is ever truly finished.\nHe approaches music as both a craft and a business, fully aware that being an artist also means being an entrepreneur. That balance was once a challenge, but with time and research, he’s embraced both roles. On tracks like “RWANDA,” a lively, danceable anthem created with longtime collaborator Altmadara, he shows he’s just getting started. For Drew, music is a calling, not a hobby, and fans can feel that truth in every lyric.\nWhen he’s not making music, he’s likely watching Marvel or DC films, or unexpectedly vibing out to Julia Michaels. But when asked what he’d do if he wasn’t making music, the answer is simple. Nothing else. This is his purpose, and he’s all in.\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/solodrew/\n\n© 2025,Logan.

        "title": "Boss Way Lynn Drops Explosive New Single “Going On”: A Raw Reflection of Albany’s Energy and Hustle",
        "description": "\nAlbany’s own Boss Way Lynn is back with a hard-hitting new single titled “Going On,” a track that not only showcases her lyrical growth but also delivers a powerful message rooted deeply in her environment and culture. Known for keeping it real and reflecting the streets shes from, Boss Way Lynn uses this new single to give listeners a vivid glimpse into what life is like around her—unfiltered, intense, and full of motion.“My environment and culture is what inspired the song honestly,” Lynn shares. “It’s just things I see going on around me.” With that raw honesty as the foundation, “Going On” is more than just another song—it’s a statement. A declaration from an artist who’s lived it, seen it, and is now speaking on it through his music.A Shift in Sound and StyleFor fans who’ve been following Boss Way Lynn’s journey, this track marks an evolution. There’s a noticeable shift in tone and delivery—she’s not just rapping; shes speaking with conviction, energy, and purpose. “I came with a different tone, more energy,” she explains. “Feeling my flow better than ever while putting my words and creativity together to make this dope track.”That growth is evident from the jump. The beat hits harder, the cadence is tighter, and the bars carry a sharper edge. Lynn sounds more locked in than ever, and it’s clear he’s stepping into a new era of his artistry.The Creative SparkSo how did “Going On” come to life? According to Lynn, it started with inspiration from the game’s heavyweights—specifically Future’s recent work with “Type Shit” and “Plutoski.” But instead of copying a trend, Lynn took what she heard and flipped it into something unique.“I was seeing what Future was doing… and was like imma make a song with what I be saying all the time which was ‘man this shit going on,’” she says.That everyday expression—something she’d naturally say in conversation—became the cornerstone of the entire track. It’s that authenticity that makes the song resonate so deeply. It feels less like a fabricated hit and more like a lived experience turned into art.Heavyweight CollaborationsJoining Boss Way Lynn on “Going On” are two Florida standouts: Tyte and Goldenboy Countup. Both artists brought their own flavor to the record, creating a regional connection between Georgia and Florida that elevates the track even further.“Sent those guys the song and they got me the verse back with a quick turnaround,” Lynn says. The chemistry is undeniable. Each verse brings something unique, but the cohesion in energy and message makes it feel like a natural fit.More Than Just a SingleWhile “Going On” is strong enough to stand alone, it’s not just a one-off drop. According to Boss Way Lynn, this single is part of a larger project that’s on the horizon. Though details about the full body of work are still under wraps, if this track is any indication, fans can expect something gritty, real, and unapologetically Southern.This upcoming project could be a defining moment for Lynn, marking the next phase in her journey as an artist—and she knows exactly where he’s headed with it.Raw Emotion and Real-Life ExperienceAt the core of “Going On” lies emotion—raw and unfiltered. “Basically everything going on around me; stuff me & the team be doing—I put it all together all in one and you get This shit going on,” Lynn explains.You can hear the weight of experiences in every bar. Whether it’s street life, struggles, ambition, or loyalty, the track captures the rollercoaster of emotions that come with trying to make it out of a tough environment while staying true to your roots.The Rollout PlanLynn isn’t just dropping the song and walking away. She’s going full throttle on the promotional front. A visual is already in the works, and she’s gearing up for two live performances on different platforms to bring the energy of the record to the stage.“We have a marketing scheme throughout our own platforms as well,” she says, hinting at a strategic push that’s about to get “Going On” in front of even more ears and eyes.It’s not just about music for Lynn—it’s about movement. Building a brand, expanding a sound, and connecting with real listeners who relate to the struggle and the grind.The MessageSo what does Boss Way Lynn want people to walk away with after hearing “Going On”?The message is simple: open your eyes. Take a look at what’s happening around you. Whether you’re from Albany or anywhere else with the same energy, this record speaks to survival, observation, and awareness. It’s about staying ten toes down in a world that’s constantly shifting.“This shit going on” isn’t just a phrase—it’s a lifestyle, a reality, and a reflection. And with this track, Boss Way Lynn is giving it a voice.\nFollow Boss Way Lynn on Instagram: @bosswaylynn (https://www.instagram.com/bosswaylynn?igsh=dG84emx2dXZsdG5m)Stay tuned for the official video and upcoming live performances. “Going On” is now available on all streaming platforms.\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "Shawn Connor’s Bold New Chapter: ‘The Best To Ever Do It’ is a Southern Manifesto of Self-Belief and Trap Legacy",
        "description": "\nFrom the quiet town of Eutawville, South Carolina—a place with fewer than 500 people—to the bustling stages of Charlotte, North Carolina, Shawn Connor is making a case for greatness with his new albumThe Best To Ever Do It. At just 28 years old, he’s already worked with iconic producers like Zaytoven, MaalyRaw, and Nard & B, and even sold out the Fillmore in Charlotte. Now, with his latest release, he’s taking things up a notch—not just sonically, but spiritually.\nThe Best To Ever Do Itisn’t just an audacious title—it’s a personal mantra. Rooted in the trap music of the mid to late 2000s, the project draws inspiration from a time when Southern rap dominated street corners, car stereos, and dance floors alike. “It was unavoidable for me growing up,” Shawn says. “It was playing everywhere around at such a young malleable age.” That exposure laid the foundation for the sound of the album—a blend of high-octane beats, street poetry, and internal monologue.\nBut it’s more than a nod to a genre—it’s a love letter to his younger self. One filled with words of encouragement, subtle braggadocio, and the grit it takes to keep believing in yourself when the world doesn’t yet catch on.\nAs a self-described writer before anything else, Shawn’s process starts with language. Sometimes it’s a single line floating around in his head that eventually snowballs into a full record. “It’s like putting pieces together on a jigsaw puzzle,” he says. He crafts hooks, then allows the beat to dictate how the story unfolds—forming a “symbiotic relationship between words and rhythm.”\nThis balance between spontaneity and structure gives his work a unique cadence. His influences—Kanye West and Drake—shine through not in mimicry but in mindset. Kanye’s audacity to experiment and Drake’s finesse with melody have each left a lasting mark on his creative DNA. “You really don’t have to conform to the popular sound to make great music,” he notes, reflecting Kanye’s rule-breaking ethos. Meanwhile, the melodic touch is pure Drake—and a defining element of Shawn’s artistry.\nDespite accomplishments like headlining events and working with platinum-level producers, Shawn says one of his toughest challenges has beenrecognition. “It’s like—when will it ever be enough?” he admits, shedding light on the silent struggles that artists face in the journey toward visibility.\nStill, the victories are real. Selling out the Fillmore in 2020 during a time of global uncertainty was a defining moment. “For someone from a town with less than 500 people, these things are just dreams,” he says. And yet, they’re now part of his reality.\nShawn doesn’t force inspiration. In fact, he leans into the lull between bursts of genius. “Sometimes I can go weeks or months without writing or recording,” he says. “And then when it’s time, I crank out 5-7 songs in one session.” This unconventional rhythm speaks to a larger philosophy—creating when it matters, not just for the sake of content.\nWhile fans can definitely expect more music, Shawn teases upcoming creative venturesoutsideof rap. “After all, I said I was a writer, but I never said it was exclusively in music,” he hints. Whether it’s books, scripts, or visual storytelling, it’s clear his artistry isn’t confined to a single medium.\nAt the heart of it all lies a powerful message: dreams are attainable. “If you honestly believe in yourself, no goal is unattainable,” he affirms. That belief system, echoed in both his lyrics and life, is what keeps him—and his audience—moving forward.\nWith a career rooted in resilience, inspiration, and raw Southern flavor, Shawn Connor is proving that authenticity and perseverance are a powerful combination. As he steps into his next era, fans and newcomers alike can keep up with his journey at:\n👉OfficialShawnConnor Linktree\nWhether you’re riding to trap beats or reading his next penned masterpiece, one thing is clear—Shawn Connor isn’t just making music. He’s building a legacy.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Living the Truth: An Inside Look With A.K.A. The Truth",
        "description": "\nFor A.K.A. The Truth, the name itself is a story. One rooted in identity, resilience, and creative self-expression. The moniker stems from the first three letters of his last name, “AKA,” which he says symbolizes a legacy of silencing doubt and standing firm in authenticity. “The Truth” was a serendipitous addition, courtesy of a rap name generator, but it stuck, perfectly capturing his refusal to stray from who he is. “I always have something to say because all I do is live in my truth,” he explains. That mindset isn’t just branding, it’s his essence as an artist.\nHis journey in music began in late 2019 with Snapchat Freestyle Fridays that quickly caught fire on his college campus. That momentum led him to connect with a local engineer, and before long, he was riding trains to record real songs. The DIY spirit paid off: his first release in early 2020 caught major attention both online and in-person. The validation from peers pushed him to get serious. “When I lock in on something, I give it 110%,” he says. “I did what I said I would and that’s the truth!”\nBut it wasn’t just the buzz that solidified his path, it was heartbreak. After a painful breakup, he found that his usual outlets like basketball and video games couldn’t touch the emotional weight, so he turned to the mic. That creative outpouring became his foundation as a vocalist and songwriter, unlocking new flows and emotions. His first live performance post-pandemic, in Buffalo, NY, brought the full-circle moment. “I sang the records I wrote in my bedroom…and people I’d never met were whistling, standing, flooding me with love after the show. That’s when I knew I’m truly an artist.”\nWhen asked to describe his sound, A.K.A. The Truth doesn’t mince words. “It’s not a copy, it’s real and fresh – like fruit off the farm, no GMO,” he jokes. His music isn’t trying to fit in. It’s made for those hungry for something honest and timeless. He sees himself as someone reflecting the human experience, his own, and by extension, ours. “I’m human and so is everyone reading this,” he says. “Hopefully, you can take what you want from it…vibes, inspiration, realness.”\nMusically, his influences run deep and wide: Michael Jackson, Rexx Life Raj, Jon Bellion, Chris Brown, Usher, A$AP Rocky, Timbaland, Kanye (old Kanye), Jazmine Sullivan, and Jennifer Hudson. Off the mic, Kobe Bryant and his mother remain pillars of inspiration. His writing process is intuitive, pulling from life and emotion more than structure. “I write when it calls to me,” he says. “Sometimes I go back and hear a song I wrote and think, ‘Damn, I wrote that?’ It’s not even me, it’s God using me as a vessel.”\nThe creative process starts with a beat more often than not. He’ll mumble melodies until something clicks, then layer in words and meaning. Whether working solo or calling up producers like Gramps The Producer or CPDP, the approach is always organic. He doesn’t force records into existence, they come to him when the vibe is right. A track is only done, he says, “when I can play it over and over and never get sick of it.”\nAt the heart of his music is a message:be real.“There’s power in authenticity and knowing who you are,” he says. It’s why he chose “The Truth” in the first place. His lyrics often explore personal truths and encourage others to reflect on their own. He believes deeply in being honest with yourself first and foremost. “A lot of us live in denial, and that’s unhealthy. The realest thing you can do is acknowledge what you feel and where your boundaries lie.”\nDespite this openness, he still keeps parts of himself protected. “I can control what parts of my world I give,” he says. “Some things are meant for me and only me.” His philosophy? Share your dimensions, not your entirety, and always move with intention. For him, living through your passion is the end goal. “Your talent + helping people = your passion,” he explains. That’s the formula he lives by.\nBut the music industry, he admits, isn’t all glamor. “People don’t see the failed shows, the thousands poured into one track, or the pressure to constantly create content to keep up demand.” The behind-the-scenes grind is real, and it’s easy to burn out, not from music, but from everything that surrounds it. That’s where a solid team comes in. Delegating tasks helps him stay centered on what matters most:the art.\nStill, he remains grounded. “I started this to make timeless music that leaves an impact,” he says. And that focus helps him navigate the business side without losing his soul. By constantly learning, staying curious, and remembering his why, he’s found a balance that works. “I compartmentalize the business stuff so I can stay locked into my creative side.”\nAs for the fun stuff? He climbed Machu Picchu at 19 and had a brief standoff with a llama before posing for a photo. His playlist might raise some eyebrows too: “I got one country song in there, ‘Broadway Girls’ with Lil Durk. It’s a bop, I’m not gon’ lie.” And if he weren’t making music, he’d be exploring the world or using his background in neuroscience to break down complex science for everyday people…but with his own unique flair.\nIn every dimension – whether as a scientist, storyteller, performer, or thinker, A.K.A. The Truth is living up to his name. He’s not just another voice in the crowd. He’s a presence, a perspective, and a promise: that what you hear is always going to be real.\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/itsakathetruth/\nWebsite:https://akathetruth.com/\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/artist/1vRJaZJ2cgn7PW886nwN3T\n© 2025,Logan.

        "description": "\nIt looks like the drama between Iam Shamar and Shamarco just reached a boiling point — and fans are eating it up.\nOver the weekend, Iam Shamar took to Instagram to throw some serious shade at Shamarco after news surfaced that Shamarco’s house had allegedly been robbed — and the shocking twist? The robbery may have been an inside job involving Shamarco’s new boyfriend.\nIn a series of savage Instagram Story posts, Iam Shamar didn’t hold back. “How you get with dude & he got you robbed yikes,” he wrote, clearly implying that Shamarco’s new relationship may have led directly to the break-in. He followed up with even sharper words: “Talking about some that’s the love of your life it be the delusion for me.”\nFans immediately took notice — and so did Shamarco. Shortly after Iam Shamar’s posts, Shamarco deleted all traces of his new boyfriend from his Instagram page, fueling even more speculation. According to sources close to the situation, fans believe the new boyfriend may have set Shamarco up, allegedly luring him away with a fake “booking” while his associates hit Shamarco’s home.\nThe betrayal, if true, is wild — and the internet is already buzzing with theories. Many fans are pointing out how fast Shamarco scrubbed his page clean, suggesting he may have found out about the setup himself. Meanwhile, Iam Shamar’s posts only added gasoline to the fire, with fans praising him for “calling it out” while others are wondering if this is just the beginning of an even messier fallout.\n\nNeither Shamarco nor his (former?) boyfriend has publicly addressed the robbery allegations yet, but one thing is clear: the streets — and social media — are watching closely.\nStay tuned, because this story is far from over.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "SuavoBaby: The Suave Wordsmith Ready to Shift the Culture",
        "description": "\nIn an era where authenticity often feels like an afterthought, SuavoBaby emerges as a refreshing force, equal parts hustler, wordsmith, and visionary. More than just a name, SuavoBaby encapsulates the essence of an artist who’s as smooth as he is strategic. “It’s all me,” he says. “Suave hustler but yet wordsmith, gift of gab. Music is my outlet to draw masterpieces, audio art.” And with that ethos, he’s been steadily carving a lane that refuses to be boxed in.\nA Voice for the People\nSuavoBaby’s music isn’t just for the charts; it’s for the streets, the survivors, the club-goers, the dreamers, and anyone looking for something real. Whether you’re a gym rat, a fashion head, or a student of the old or new school, he’s got something for you. His sound defies genre borders because, as he puts it, “music is diverse for me.”\nWhat separates him from the pack isn’t just his ability to rap—it’s the way he connects. His USP? “Personality sells more than the music does if you work that market correctly. I’m for the people, not against them.” That magnetic presence extends beyond the mic, making him a force not just on stage, but in any room he steps into.\nFYVM: A Statement, Not Just a ProjectCurrently pushing FYVM, a full-length album that feels more like a journey than a mixtape, SuavoBaby is serving up timeless quality. “This is solid material that defines my growth at its best,” he explains. Every track is a chapter in his evolution, raw, refined, and real.\nHis philosophy is simple but powerful: “I love to receive wisdom to not just grow, but give others these gems of life.” That mindset fuels not just his music, but his mission, to inspire, uplift, and energize listeners with something deeper than just catchy hooks.\nInfluences and Inspirations\nHis musical DNA reads like a Hall of Fame roster. Nas, 2Pac, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, Future, Kevin Gates, Drake, Nipsey Hussle, and Kanye West all leave fingerprints on his artistry. “That’s just rap,” he laughs, as he goes on to list a slew of R&B talents he’d love to work with, from Chris Brown and Summer Walker to T-Pain and Ari Lennox.\nWhen it comes to production, SuavoBaby keeps it close to home. “My guys, family that is.” With names like Big-U, RyanJade, Rod Dizzle, JonJyzzle, and DLaw (Networkkas), he’s built a trusted circle of sonic architects. But don’t get it twisted, he’s wide open to collaborate with heat makers like Metro Boomin, Alchemist, Just Blaze, and Mannie Fresh.\nIndustry Insight and Intent\nHe calls the music industry “Bogus/Focus”—a duality where greatness and garbage coexist. But instead of complaining, he’s learning, adapting, and building. “Been taken advantage of financially, blind ASF,” he admits. “But now it’s a play for me.” His goal? To be both marketable and motivational. “Being both, you’ll always be the best of both worlds.”\nIf he could change anything, it would be the microwave nature of today’s music. “Songs grow older due to aged style,” he says. He’s aiming for longevity, not just virality.\nThe Showman and the Student\nLive performances used to be trial by fire. “No water, no order of operation,” he remembers. But experience has turned chaos into craftsmanship. “Now I always plan to give my best when performing.” Guided by lessons from his producer Jon Jyzzle, SuavoBaby records with the stage in mind, blending precision with passion.\nThe Album, The Movement\nHis upcoming album marks a new chapter with his label Mylestonerz. “Singles are hot, but the album will make you call the ambulance,” he says, laughing but serious. And while his official website is still under construction, fans can tap into his world through social media:\nInstagram:@SuavoBaby90\nTikTok/X: @babyfacesuavo\nFacebook: Azzarius Lane aka SuavoBaby\nYouTube: Suavo Baby (look for Slangbaby Suavo as well)\nSuavoBaby isn’t just making music—he’s making moments, memories, and a mark on the culture that can’t be ignored. If you’re sleeping on him now, don’t worry—he’ll wake you up real soon.\n\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Fredrica Russell: The Gospel Rapper from Lexington Using Her Voice to Heal, Inspire, and Serve",
        "description": "\nFredrica Russell, a gospel rapper from Lexington, Kentucky, is on a mission to transform lives through music, ministry, and community outreach. Her journey began at the age of 14, when she started experimenting with underground rap for fun. It wasn’t until her late 20s that she realized rapping wasn’t just a hobby—it was a gift she had been called to use for a higher purpose.\nInitially involved in secular rap, Fredrica eventually found her true path in gospel music, using her lyrical talent to spread messages of faith, healing, and resilience. She now focuses exclusively on gospel rap, dedicating her music to glorifying God and uplifting the community.\nBut her impact stretches far beyond music. Fredrica is also the author of From Broken to Beautiful, a powerful book that reflects her personal transformation and the divine calling she’s embraced. She believes she was chosen by God—not just to rise above her own challenges, but to be a light for others navigating darkness.\nDriven by this spiritual conviction, Fredrica has become a philanthropist and street minister. Her mission is to reach those who feel disconnected from the church and traditional faith spaces. She says, “Street ministry is where it’s at, especially when the people don’t want to come to the church.” Fredrica believes the church must go to the streets, meeting people where they are and serving their most urgent needs—physically, emotionally, and spiritually.\nHer outreach work is hands-on and heartfelt. Whether she’s giving away essentials, feeding the hungry, or offering soul-winning services, Fredrica is always guided by compassion and purpose. “I always give my last penny if I have to, to make sure the need is met,” she says, describing her commitment to the welfare of others.\nShe also founded a women-only program and social club focused on peer support and healing. The group addresses critical issues like mental illness, substance abuse, and emotional stress. It’s a space where women can come together, uplift one another, and unwind in a judgment-free zone.\nFredrica Russell isn’t chasing fame—she’s chasing impact. As a gospel rapper, author, philanthropist, and street minister, her work is a testament to the power of purpose-driven artistry. Through her music, her outreach, and her unwavering faith, she’s proving that true influence comes not from popularity, but from walking boldly in your calling.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

This single has rapidly generated buzz, demonstrating Damarko’s growing prominence and the strong connection he continues to build with his listeners.\nDamarko’s music is heavily influenced by his formative years spent between Brooklyn, New York, and California.

        "title": "Bruse Wane: A Stalwart of Boom Bap in an Era of Digital Disposability",
        "description": "\nAs Hip Hop continues its march into the algorithmic age, driven more by TikTok virality and trap infused aesthetics than lyrical depth or sonic grit, Hip Hop artist Bruse Wane offers a defiant alternative. While many artists conform to the trends, Wane insists on remaining rooted in the raw energy of Hip Hop’s foundational era. But is his commitment to tradition a strength, or a self-imposed boundary?\nWane, hailing from the historic Bronxdale Housing Projects in the South Bronx, is no casual revivalist. His music is informed by both legacy and lived experience, shaped by the same streets that produced culture shifting figures like Disco King Mario and Andre Harrell. Yet what distinguishes Wane isn’t just his birthplace; it’s his determination to make “Boom Bap” relevant again.\nCritically, Wane’s discography reveals a deep respect for the genre’s roots. His 2013 debut, The Dark Knight Album: The Day The Earth Stood Still, introduced him as a disciplined lyricist with tracks like “Beast Inside” (featuring Sean Price), showcasing his knack for narrative and verbal precision. However, it wasn’t until 2015’s The Earl Manigault of Rap that Wane hit his stride. “Venom,” featuring the late Sean Price’s final recorded verse, became a standout moment, not just for its historical weight but for the seamless chemistry and aggressive lyricism it delivered.\nStill, some critics have questioned whether Wane’s brand of Hip Hop is adaptive enough for a modern audience. His refusal to deviate from golden-era conventions risks alienating younger listeners, many of whom are attuned to melodic flows and trap percussion. Yet Wane resists compromise. That very resistance has become both his strength and his artistic thesis.\nHis 2019 release, The Dark Knight Album 2: Fight For Gotham, with the Papoose-assisted single “Killa Soundboy,” was a bold reminder that he is not looking to reinvent himself for mainstream acceptance. Instead, he doubles down on lyricism, grimy production, and East Coast aesthetics. It’s a creative decision that earned respect among purists, even if it didn’t dominate the charts.\nThat said, Wane isn’t entirely confined to the past. His recent collaborations suggest a willingness to explore. In 2023, he surprised longtime fans by teaming with reggae icon Dawn Penn on a remix of “No, No, No,” showcasing a more melodic, cross-genre sensibility. Later that year, he joined forces with Kurtis Mantronik, of the pioneering electro-funk group Mantronix, for a series of boundary-pushing tracks including “Money Talks” and “Era of the AI.” These efforts revealed a side of Wane more willing to address contemporary issues and sonic experimentation, proving he can evolve without diluting his core.\nLooking ahead, The Darth Wane Album, set for release on July 7, 2025, may represent his most ambitious work yet. Anchored by the ominous, metaphor heavy lead single “Sith Lord,” released on April 22, Wane appears to be leaning into conceptual storytelling with philosophical undertones. The project promises collaborations with Bronx eccentric Kool Keith and UK underground vet Blade, hinting at a more globally conscious, thematically layered effort.\nIn an industry where buzz often outweighs bars, Bruse Wane isn’t interested in being trendy. He’s focused on being timeless. Yet the question remains: can an artist so tethered to the past continue to make meaningful strides in today’s fragmented, fast-paced music economy?\nWhether one sees him as a necessary traditionalist or an artist slightly out of step with the times, there’s no denying Wane’s dedication.

        "title": "A$H Music: The Unfiltered Voice of South London’s Grime Renaissance",
        "description": "\nIn the world of UK rap, few voices feel as raw, resonant, and refreshingly real as A$H. Emerging from the depths of South London’s lyrical battlegrounds, A$H is more than an artist—he’s a movement in motion.\nHis music, rooted in grime and UK drill yet branching into introspective alt-hip-hop, paints vivid portraits of struggle, growth, and identity. Now five years deep into his career, A$H stands at the edge of a breakthrough, and his latest release,A$H Infusion, marks a critical turning point—not just for him, but for a soundscape that’s craving sincerity.\nAt its core,A$H Infusionis more than an album—it’s a manifesto for synergy. In an era where streaming culture often dilutes artistic cohesion, A$H counters with a record that thrives on intentional connection. Featuring an array of collaborators, the album bends genre lines, seamlessly merging drill’s rugged tempo with grime’s assertiveness and alt-hip-hop’s melodic texture.\nTracks like“Hotline”and“Misplaced Pt II: Found My Way”showcase A$H’s ability to anchor diverse voices while remaining undeniably himself. The thematic core of the album revolves around transformation, both artistically and personally, with each feature acting as a mirror reflecting new dimensions of A$H’s identity.\nThis isn’t just a feature-heavy project—it’s a body of work meticulously curated to represent evolution. As A$H himself puts it,“A$H Infusion was the spark.”And what a spark it is—igniting interest, opening dialogues, and laying the groundwork for deeper narratives still to come.\nAmong the standout tracks,“Perfect Timing”is perhaps the most emblematic of A$H’s current state of mind. It’s not just a banger—it’s a philosophy. Built around the concept of trusting divine timing, the song layers confident bars over a reflective beat, making it both an earworm and a sermon.\nThis isn’t about waiting for life to happen. It’s about recognizing that every moment, every delay, every detour contributes to a grander design. As A$H raps about personal alignment and intentional action, the message resonates far beyond music—it becomes a mantra for anyone chasing purpose.\nA$H’s sound is a paradox of sorts—gritty yet graceful, aggressive yet introspective. It’s a space where thestaccato punch of drillmeets thefluid storytelling of hip-hop, all underscored by grime’s cultural DNA. What sets him apart is the emotional honesty laced through his bars. Songs like“Shit on My Mind”offer no filters, just raw reflections on mental health, relationships, and resilience.\nWhere many UK rappers lean heavily on bravado, A$H isn’t afraid to be vulnerable. That openness doesn’t weaken his voice—it amplifies it. The listener isn’t just bobbing to the beat; they’re sitting in the passenger seat of his lived experience.\n\nCollaboration isn’t new to A$H, but his partnership withFoaFoahas proven especially fruitful. Their chemistry crackles on“Ride or Die”, a track that fuses emotional urgency with lyrical finesse. Their upcomingjoint EP, set to drop inAugust, promises even more of that alchemy.\nComprised of four tracks, the project is positioned to explore themes of loyalty, ambition, and duality. According to A$H,“Now with the EP, me and FoaFoa are showing the next chapter.”It’s clear they’re not just collaborators—they’re co-authors of a shared vision.\nThe anticipation around this release is palpable. Fans are eager not only for the music but for the deeper insights into who A$H is becoming as an artist and individual. In many ways, this EP is less of a sequel and more of a spotlight—illuminating the complex layers of his artistry.\n\nA$H’s music is deeply rooted in South London, a borough that has birthed legends and bred authenticity. Yet, while his sound is unmistakably local, his message is universal. The themes he explores—identity, timing, perseverance—transcend postcode lines and cultural barriers.\nThis balance of specificity and universality is what makes A$H’s music magnetic. It’s grounded in lived experience but crafted with a global consciousness. Whether you’re from Peckham or Portland, the emotional truths hit the same.\nIn a genre that sometimes suffers from oversaturation and formulaic output, A$H offers something refreshingly rare—substance. He doesn’t just ride beats; he wrestles with them, using music as a canvas for self-discovery and social commentary.\nThe UK rap scene needs voices like his—artists unafraid to dig deep, to challenge norms, and to grow publicly. A$H isn’t perfect, and he’s not trying to be. He’s present. He’s real. And right now, that’s exactly what the culture needs.\n1. What genre does A$H make music in?A$H blends grime, UK drill, alternative hip-hop, and introspective rap, creating a unique and emotionally driven sound.\n2. What isA$H Infusionabout?The album explores personal growth and creative synergy through collaborations, offering a versatile sound palette and honest storytelling.\n3. Who is FoaFoa, and what’s their connection to A$H?FoaFoa is a fellow artist and frequent collaborator. Their joint EP, releasing in August, showcases their artistic chemistry.\n4. What is the message behind “Perfect Timing”?The track speaks to the journey of discovering true love and finding the one who feels meant for you. It’s about timing that feels divinely orchestrated—not forced, but perfectly aligned when hearts are ready.\n5. Where is A$H from?A$H hails from South London, UK—a region known for its influence on the grime and UK rap scene.\n6. How long has A$H been active in the music scene?A$H has been making music for over five years, steadily building a reputation for depth, honesty, and versatility.\n\nA$H isn’t just another name in the UK rap landscape—he’s a disruptor. ThroughA$H Infusionand his forthcoming EP with FoaFoa, he’s charting a course that’s as emotionally rich as it is sonically bold. Whether you’re a longtime grime fan or new to the scene, A$H’s music demands your attention—not with noise, but with nuance.\nHis story is still unfolding, but one thing’s clear: this is only the beginning.\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "Alternative Rap Is the New Punk Rock — Awkward DreadHead Is Proof",
        "description": "\nIn an era where genre is a ghost and playlists are gospel, one truth remains: rebellion never dies — it just reinvents its soundtrack. Punk rock once screamed defiance through jagged guitars and snarling vocals. Now, that same energy pulses in the shadows of hip-hop, R&B, and alternative pop, where artists likeAwkward DreadHeadare crafting anthems that flip expectations inside out.\nHis latest track,“The Life,”doesn’t shout rebellion — it hums it. It floats with confidence, gliding on polished synths and 808s, and carries the spirit of “I’ll rock left, y’all can stay right.” There’s no need for distorted guitars or DIY garage aesthetics — and that’s the point. The real subversion is how Awkward DreadHead bends cultural codes with style and substance.\nAlternative music once meant “the weird white kids who didn’t fit.” Today, it’s being reclaimed by Black creators who refuse to be boxed in. Awkward DreadHead is part of a new wave of artists who channel punk energy not through chaos, but throughemotional honesty,genre fluidity, and anunapologetic refusal to conform.\n“The Life” is a masterclass in subtle defiance. You can catch echoes of Tame Impala’s melodies, The Go! Team’s layered unpredictability, and Tyler, The Creator’s swaggering genre fusion. But Awkward DreadHead isn’t imitating anyone — he’s carving his own lane. His delivery istender yet assertive, floating above sleek, futuristic production. It doesn’t need to yell to make a point — it just exists. And in a world obsessed with categories, that’s a radical act in itself.\nBeneath the vibes and slickness of “The Life” is a quiet protest. A protest against the idea thatblackness must sound a certain way.That hip-hop must be aggressive. That R&B must be romantic. That pop, when made by Black artists, must somehow be reclassified as “urban.”\nAwkward DreadHead sidesteps all those traps and instead offers somethingcooler, stranger, and more fluid. His music is a statement — not of resistance through noise, but through nuance. It’s the same tension that once made punk dangerous:being seen without being stereotyped.\nWe’re in a new era. Today’s mosh pit isn’t physical — it’s digital. It’s an algorithmic battlefield ofniche fanbases, cultural gatekeepers, and SoundCloud wormholes. The modern punk is a lonely teen in their bedroom uploading a genreless masterpiece that doesn’t check any of the industry’s boxes.\nThat’s what “The Life” represents. It’s clean. It’s vibey. It’s beautifully hard to categorize. And that’s what makes it so punk.\nSo call Awkward DreadHead what you want — rapper, singer, alternative enigma. But don’t get it twisted: he’s not just proof that alternative music is alive. He’s leading the rebellion. You just have to learn how to listen.\nThe first single to hiscomic book soundtrackThe Siege of HollowbornsdropsJune 19th.Explore more at:www.awkwarddreadheadcomics.com\nCatch more music and updates at:www.awkwarddreadhead.com\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "Exclusive: Wydeeonthetrack – The Swiss Beatmaker Breaking Borders and Building Legacy",
        "description": "\nHipHopSince1987 Exclusive | Written by: Variety Press\nIn a genre born on the stoops of the Bronx and blasted through the speakers of every corner block from Compton to Queens, hip-hop has always been about raw truth, cultural collisions, and fearless innovation. And in 2025, one name is echoing across the Atlantic with the kind of heat you don’t ignore:Wydeeonthetrack.\nBornYannick Douadon July 25, 1986, in Switzerland, this Spanish-Moroccan composer isn’t your average bedroom producer. While most kids were chasing trends, Wydee was chasing chords. At just 10 years old, guided by his musician father’s wisdom and a second-hand keyboard, he dove into the world of drums and melodies. His first studio? His bedroom. His first gear? A $90 beat-making program most would laugh at. But for Wydee, it was divine intervention.\n“Music is given by unseen creativity,” he recalls, quoting his father. “And like Pharrell said—God is in control.”\nDecades later, Wydee immortalized his early grind inThe Heaven Album, a soulful time capsule of his first-ever beats. It’s not just a project—it’s proof. Proof that raw talent and belief in the process can birth art that resonates years later. With the addition of a keyboard and matured production techniques, he’s elevated that early magic into something timeless.\nWydee’s breakout moment? Producing forDipset’s 40th Boys 2, featuring40 Cal and A-Mafia—a track that found its home onWorldStarHipHopand lit a fire under his international presence.\nThat wasn’t luck—it was earned.\nSince then, Wydee has worked with a lineup of certified names:St. Laz(Brooklyn),G.A.G.E.(Philly),Nu Jerzey Devil(Black Wall Street),DJ Lazy K,DJ Smooth Montana, and the late greatDJ Whiteowl (RIP). His fingerprints are on mixtapes, radio stations, and digital series fromShaq Fu RadiotoTrap Monopoly.\n“Seeing my name next to Dipset? That was the moment. I knew I belonged in this culture.”\nWydee’s not shy about his influences. He namesDr. Dre,Scott Storch,The Alchemist,Rick Rubin,50 Cent, andSnoop Doggas his North Stars. But he never mimicked—he absorbed, transformed, and pushed forward with his own fingerprint.\nHis sound? A unique fusion of nostalgic East Coast grit and modern trap undertones, dressed with melodic flourishes that only a seasoned musician can deliver. Think lo-fi soul meets mixtape hunger. Think international blood with hometown pride.\nA lot of producers burn out. Not Wydee. He’s still in the trenches, crafting beats daily, connecting with American artists, and expanding his soundscape from Old School boom-bap to New School trap bangers. He’s locked in with long-term vision:\n“I’m not quitting after 30 years. I’ve got Billboard dreams, and I won’t stop till I touch it.”\nBehind every beat, there’s belief. Wydee’s message to the culture is loud and clear:everything is possible if you believe. From a small-town compound to the playlists of giants, he’s proof that authenticity cuts through the noise.\n“There’s an audience out there looking for me. I just have to keep delivering.”\n🎧 Stream the music:Linktree\n📲 Tap in on IG:@wydeeonthetrack\n🔥 Watch the Dipset collab:WorldStarHipHop\nIn an era of fast fame and disposable hits,Wydeeonthetrackis building something real. He’s not here for clout—he’s here for legacy. And from where we’re standing, the climb is just getting started.\nHipHopSince1987. Respect the culture.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nAs the sun dips behind palm-lined boulevards and California’s skies burn orange with twilight, there’s no better soundtrack than Nice Major’s15Min High.3. Slated for release on May 30, 2025, this short-form EP encapsulates the essence of West Coast lifestyle rap in a tight, seamless 15-minute listening experience. For those who value authenticity, breezy confidence, and a hint of nostalgia,15Min High.3is more than an album—it’s a ride.\nCrafted specifically for those transitional 6PM drives—when day turns to night and the soul yearns for escape—15Min High.3immerses listeners in the atmospheric cool of SoCal life. It’s a celebration of cruising culture, spontaneous inspiration, and the laid-back bravado that defines West Coast hip-hop. The album exudes a distinctly Californian sense of cool: sun-soaked, bass-heavy, and rhythmically smooth.\nWhat makes this project stand out is how it doesn’t try to be everything—it chooses to be something, and it nails that identity with precision. The EP is laser-focused on its mood and mission: to elevate your drive, enhance your sunset, and immerse you in vibes that feel both immediate and eternal.\nNice Major isn’t just a rapper—he’s a mood architect. His delivery across15Min High.3is confident without being loud, stylish without posturing. There’s a quiet mastery in how he allows the music to breathe, letting each beat build an atmosphere before weaving in his effortlessly clever bars.\nHis flows glide over top-tier production from some of the underground’s most respected beatmakers. Instead of cluttering the mix with overproduction, the soundscape is cinematic and clean, leaving space for storytelling, metaphors, and that all-important groove. The result? A project that plays like a mixtape from a ‘90s classic car deck but with 2025 sensibilities.\n\nOne of the EP’s defining moments comes with the track “BE EAZY,” which features the legendary MC Eiht. Known for his indelible impact on Compton’s sonic legacy, Eiht brings a grounding authority to the project. His verse isn’t just a cameo—it’s a reaffirmation of lineage, bridging eras with gravitas and style.\nFor longtime fans of West Coast hip-hop, this feature is more than nostalgia—it’s recognition. It’s Nice Major standing shoulder to shoulder with a forefather of the genre and holding his own with poise and lyrical strength.\n\nThere’s a reason the project isn’t calledHigh.3 the Album—it’s a 15-minute cruise, and every second matters. Tracks bleed into each other with a mixtape-like energy that feels curated rather than random. Each beat sets the stage for the next, offering a journey rather than a playlist.\nThis curated flow reinforces the idea that15Min High.3isn’t a project meant to be shuffled or segmented—it’s meant to be ridden straight through, ideally with the windows down and the sunset in view.\nNice Major is more than an artist; he’s a representative of a culture and a brand. Through his collective VctryCrcle, he pushes a message of timeless creativity and independent excellence.15Min High.3is an embodiment of that mission—it doesn’t pander, doesn’t chase, and doesn’t compromise. Instead, it invites listeners into a world where authenticity reigns supreme.\nHis focus on long-term artistry over momentary clout signals a welcome shift in the independent rap ecosystem—where craft, community, and cultural reverence matter more than algorithms and gimmicks.\nIn a music world bloated with overly long albums and forgettable singles,15Min High.3is refreshing for its restraint and vision. It understands the power of mood, of setting, of specificity. This is not a generic rap project—it’s a sonic snapshot of time and place.\nFrom a critical standpoint, its greatest strength lies in its clarity. Nice Major knows who he is and what he represents, and he builds every moment of this project around that clarity. This isn’t music for the masses—it’s music for those who know. And that’s what makes it timeless.\n1. What is the theme of Nice Major’s15Min High.3?It captures the spirit of West Coast cruising culture, lifestyle rap, and unfiltered, cinematic vibes.\n2. When will the EP be released?15Min High.3will drop on May 30, 2025.\n3. Who is featured on the EP?Legendary West Coast rapper MC Eiht appears on “BE EAZY,” adding gravitas and generational depth.\n4.

        "title": "P-Rawb & Big O’s ‘Time & Space’: A Daring Leap Across Sonic Dimensions and Generational Soul",
        "description": "\nIn a musical landscape often dictated by fleeting trends and algorithmic virality, the release ofTime & Space, the latest collaborative EP from P-Rawb and Big O, lands with a resonant thud—defiant, philosophical, and utterly magnetic. Four years after their underground-acclaimed debutThe Complexity, the transatlantic duo returns not with a sequel, but with a reimagined sonic ethos that challenges the bounds of hip-hop, time, and geography.\nThis five-track journey, accompanied by instrumentals, isn’t just a collection of songs—it’s a philosophical and musical exploration that showcases an impressive evolution in both style and substance. It’s what happens when two artists, separated by oceans but united in vision, take the long road toward creative growth.\nBig O, an award-winning London-based American producer, and P-Rawb, a cerebral lyricist with deep roots in New Jersey and Philadelphia, have long demonstrated chemistry that feels almost cosmically ordained. WithTime & Space, their second official offering, that chemistry matures into something more deliberate—more narrative-driven.\nThe EP was executive produced by Orlando “Big O” Turner, recorded by Darryl Michael, and mixed and mastered by Argiris “Argy W” Psylomesis. But it’s the essence behind these roles that brings the vision to life: a deep trust in craft, pacing, and introspection.\nOpening the EP is a spoken-word invocation that defies the conventions of a typical album intro. Here, ambient textures and contemplative spoken reflections prepare listeners for a thematic deep-dive. This isn’t just the start of a record—it’s the opening of a mental portal.\nA standout moment arrives early. The triumphant, gospel-tinged ‘Rise To The Top’ channels the classic energy of golden-era hip-hop while delivering an emotionally resonant, forward-looking message. P-Rawb’s delivery balances fire and finesse, standing atop Big O’s rich instrumentation. The track speaks to the human instinct to climb, persevere, and believe—even when no one else does.\nDark, pensive, and poetic, ‘Hard Pressed’ is where the EP flexes its emotional muscle. This is vulnerability without melodrama, reflection without self-pity. It’s a track that embraces discomfort—both sonically and thematically—to deliver catharsis through stripped-down elegance and lyricism.\nWhat makesTime & Spaceexceptional is its collaborative brilliance. On ‘Power Within’, the synergy between Fashawn’s polished flow, Adrienne Mack-Davis’s soul-imbued chorus, and P-Rawb’s introspection creates a moment of transcendence. Big O’s production layers vocal samples, classic drums, and cinematic flourishes, making this a high-water mark for indie hip-hop in 2025.\nClosing the vocal section of the EP is a track that fuses philosophy with turntablism. It’s metaphysical, pulsing with ancestral echoes, and fortified by eclectic verses and Decksterror’s surgical scratches. Big O stretches his palette with global rhythms and world-music touches, blending ancient motifs with futuristic energy.\n\nWhere many projects treat instrumentals as filler,Time & Spaceelevates them into standalone experiences. These versions reveal new layers and textures. In particular, the instrumental for ‘Rise To The Top’ reaffirms Big O’s knack for subtle harmonic architecture, while ‘For The Gods’ uncovers percussive depth and spatial awareness that might escape casual listeners during the vocal version.\n\nWhat makesTime & Spacenot just daring but enduring is its intercontinental DNA. It doesn’t just feature collaborations—it thrives on them. Each guest spot feels intentional, necessary, and symbiotic.\nFrom the fierce clarity of Fashawn to Adrienne Mack-Davis’s soul-affirming vocals, from L.O.U. and Rxlph’s lyrical sparring to Decksterror’s analog virtuosity, the project embodies a cooperative spirit that’s rare in today’s industry. It’s a nod to the hip-hop tradition of collective creation, reimagined for a globalized, digitized era.\nAs an observer, what’s most striking aboutTime & Spaceis its refusal to chase trends. In an era of singles-driven algorithms and viral snippets, this project rewards full engagement. It’s music made for headphones, for long walks, for quiet contemplation.\nIt’s also a model for how hip-hop can grow without losing its core. This is not nostalgia-drenched boom bap nor is it hypermodern trap. It’s a fusion—a sonic dialogue between past and present, grit and grace.\nBy bending time and collapsing space, P-Rawb & Big O have not only expanded their own boundaries but have reminded us of what makes this art form powerful: its capacity for truth, its potential for connection, and its refusal to stagnate.\n1. What is the main theme ofTime & Spaceby P-Rawb & Big O?The EP explores personal growth, resilience, collaboration, and transcending limitations—both temporal and geographic.\n2. Who are the key collaborators featured on the EP?The EP includes Fashawn, Adrienne Mack-Davis, L.O.U., Rxlph, The TBI Choir, and Decksterror, each bringing distinct styles that enhance the core themes.\n3. IsTime & Spacea continuation of their first project,The Complexity?Not directly. It’s more of a spiritual evolution—reflecting maturity and creative transformation since their first collaboration.\n4. What makes the production onTime & Spacestand out?Big O’s genre-blending approach, attention to texture, and cinematic layering distinguish the EP, particularly in the instrumental versions.\n5. Where can I stream or purchase the EP?Time & Spaceis available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Links can be found through the artists’ social profiles.\n6. How does the EP contribute to contemporary hip-hop?It challenges commercial norms with deep lyrical content, inventive production, and cross-continental collaboration, setting a bar for independent artistry.\nOFFICIAL LINKS:\nConnect with Big O onInstagram&X.

        "title": "From Brownsville to the Booth: An Interview with Rising Artist 2uece",
        "description": "\nStraight out of Brownsville, Brooklyn, 2uece is carving out his space in the music world with raw lyricism, heartfelt storytelling, and a passion rooted in family, struggle, and survival. Influenced by the golden era of ’90s hip-hop and inspired by personal battles and triumphs, 2uece opens up about his journey—from writing poetry in middle school to dropping full EPs in a week, all while carrying the weight of his past and the promise he made to his late mother. In this exclusive Q&A, 2uece speaks on life in Brownsville, how pain shapes his pen, and why he’ll never stop chasing his dream.\nQ: 2uece, let’s start at the beginning—when did your journey into music begin?\n2uece: It started at a young age. I was always around music—my older cousins, my mother and father, they used to play all that classic ’90s stuff like Gang Starr, Nice & Smooth, Mary J. Blige, Method Man, Redman, Biggie, Tupac, Warren G, Craig Mack… all of it. The instruments, the vibe, the storytelling—it made me fall in love with music and the culture.\nQ: What inspired you to take that love for music and turn it into something real?\n2uece: I always had a thing for words. I used to write poetry and short stories back in middle school. That kind of transitioned into writing rhymes. But Fabolous—that’s who really made me feel like I could do this for real. I listened to him heavy in high school, and one day I just said, “Yo, I can do this too.”\nQ: Was your family supportive when you decided to pursue music?\n2uece: My mom was my biggest supporter. She actually bought me a whole studio setup. I’ll never forget what she said—”I’m only buying this ’cause it’s gonna benefit us.” That stuck with me. Unfortunately, she passed the same year she got it for me. From that moment, I made a promise to her—and myself—that I would never quit. As long as I’m breathing, I’m chasing this dream.\nQ: Growing up in Brownsville, how did your environment shape your style?\n2uece: Brownsville is different. It’s gritty. It’s real. You see a lot at a young age. One day everything’s love, the next day there’s a shootout between buildings. It’s a place full of untold stories—and I’m just telling mine through music. My style is influenced by that reality. It’s raw, emotional, and honest.\nQ: You mentioned you’ve been through a lot personally, including PTSD. How does that impact your music?\n2uece: Music is therapy for me. I’ve been through so many ups and downs—some things I don’t even talk about with people. But when I’m in the studio, it’s just me and the mic. I let it all out. I know there are others going through the same things. My music lets them know they’re not alone. You gotta push through the pain—because it does get better.\n\nQ: Let’s talk about your track *We Run It* with your cousin Lava. What’s the story behind that one?\n2uece: Lava and I were going through similar situations at the time. He came to me like, “We need to turn this negative energy into something positive.” So we locked in and dropped an EP in a week. *We Run It* was the single from that project. It came from a real place and was about turning pain into power.\nQ: You’ve got a new release coming—*Fast Food Freestyle*—dropping May 23. What’s that one about?\n2uece: That one’s based on everyday life. Real situations I went through and saw coming. I’m big on reading energy, and time always reveals the truth. The song reflects that—how I navigate life based on instinct, vibes, and experience.\nQ: Where do you see yourself in the next five years?\n2uece: I see myself with a solid fan base. Not just fans though—family. I want to build real connections with people. I’ll never be too big to talk to someone who supports me. Some people just need someone to talk to, and I’ll always be that person because I’m human just like them. I’m not perfect, but I’m real.\nQ: Any final words to the people reading this?\n2uece: Don’t give up. No matter what you’re going through, keep pushing. As long as you wake up, your dreams are still alive. That’s something I live by every day.\nFollow 2ueceBe sure to check out *Fast Food Freestyle* dropping May 23 on all streaming platforms. Stay connected on socials for more releases, freestyles, and real talk from Brooklyn’s own.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "TJUAN BENAFACTOR’S “GIGGITY” DEBUTS AT #1 ON AMAZON MOVERS & SHAKERS",
        "description": "\nSolo single reaches #10 on Amazon Music Best Seller Charts as artist achieves multi-track chart success\nIn an extraordinary display of chart dominance, hip-hop artist Tjuan Benafactor has achieved remarkable dual success on Amazon’s music platforms. His solo single “Giggity” has rocketed to #10 on the Amazon Music Best Seller Charts while simultaneously claiming the #1 position on Amazon’s competitive Movers & Shakers Charts – signaling the track’s explosive growth in popularity.\nThis achievement is particularly noteworthy as it comes while Benafactor’s collaboration with Bantana and Snoop Dogg, “No Laccin,” continues its own impressive chart run at #9 on Amazon’s Best Seller Charts & 17 consecutive weeks on the digital charts. Having two separate tracks simultaneously occupying top positions on Amazon’s charts represents an exceptional accomplishment for an independent artist.\n“Seeing ‘Giggity’ hit #1 on Movers & Shakers while simultaneously breaking into the top 10 Best Sellers alongside ‘No Laccin’ is beyond gratifying,” said Benafactor. “This kind of momentum doesn’t happen without genuine fan support, and we’re seeing the results of the authentic connection we’ve built with our audience.”\n“Giggity,” which previously peaked at #7 on the iTunes UK Hip-Hop/Rap charts in January and reached #40 on the iTunes USA charts earlier this year, has demonstrated remarkable staying power with this resurgence on Amazon’s platforms. Industry analysts note that achieving simultaneous chart success with multiple songs across different platforms is a feat typically reserved for major label artists with extensive marketing resources.\nThe chart success builds on momentum generated earlier this year by another Benafactor & Bantana collaboration, “It’s Time” featuring CyCy Couture & hip-hop legend KRS-One. The track, which paired the duo with one of rap’s founding fathers, helped establish their credibility among both new listeners and hip-hop purists, creating a foundation for their current chart dominance.\n“Working with KRS-One on ‘It’s Time’ connected us to hip-hop’s roots while establishing our own voice,” explained Bantana. “That collaboration created a launching pad for everything we’re seeing now with both ‘No Laccin’ and ‘Giggity’ climbing the charts simultaneously.”\n\nEssince CEO of Royal Heir Ent & Benafactor’s booking & marketing manager commented, “What Tjuan is accomplishing right now – with both ‘Giggity’ and ‘No Laccin’ performing at elite levels simultaneously – showcases not just his artistic quality but the growing strength of our independent movement.

        "title": "A Raw, Reflective Journey Through Love and Growth: Exploring Major D-Star’s “For Granted / Move On”",
        "description": "\nMajor D-Star’s “For Granted / Move On” is a two-part musical confessional based on real-life experiences, emotional healing, and the reality of modern relationships.\nMusic From the Soul: Major D-Star’s Artistic Blueprint\nIn a saturated music landscape often dominated by manufactured hits and fleeting trends, Major D-Star stands out by doing what few dare—baring his soul through his craft. His recent dual-release single,“For Granted / Move On,”is more than a breakup anthem. It’s a raw testimonial, an evolution, and a reflection of the realities men often face in love, especially those who strive to be “the good guy.”\nAt its core, this two-part track tells a story many can relate to: the journey from heartbreak to healing. But Major D-Star’s delivery elevates it, offering listeners a lens into his emotional world while challenging broader cultural narratives.\n“For Granted”: The Pain of Being Overlooked\nThe first half,For Granted, opens with lines dripping in abandonment and vulnerability:\n“How you know I was coming back home / How you know I was gonna answer my phone…”\nThere’s immediate tension here—a confrontation with a partner’s assumptions, paired with the sting of being taken for granted. The song isn’t a bitter tirade, though. It’s a nuanced unpacking of disillusionment. The phrase “can’t turn my back on my own” captures a pivotal moment of self-preservation, where Major D-Star begins to prioritize his peace and identity over toxic love.\nWhat’s particularly powerful about this section is its relatability. Good men—those who try to lead with loyalty and integrity—often find themselves overlooked or undervalued. The lyrics question this imbalance without casting blame, reflecting a deeper truth about modern dating: emotional labor often goes unrecognized.\n“Move On”: The Triumph in Letting Go\nAs the song transitions toMove On, there’s a tonal shift from sadness to empowerment. The repeated hook:\n“I had to tell her move on / Cause I already moved on…”\n…becomes a mantra for emotional freedom.\nHere, the artist embraces solitude not as a punishment but as a choice. The line “even doe I wanna have a family / I really wanna have a family” reveals a tender conflict—he still holds onto traditional dreams, but not at the cost of his sanity. It’s a heart-wrenching compromise that many men are forced to make when their love is met with chaos.\nThere’s also a sharp observational critique embedded in the verse: “When dey ask what happen I know she gone lie about it.” These words highlight the gendered disparities in how breakups are perceived socially. Men are often vilified or their side is dismissed, especially if they choose to walk away.\nA Solitary Creative Ritual: Wine, Vibes, and Self-Reflection\nMajor D-Star’s creative process is almost sacred. Preferring solitude in the studio, often accompanied by wine or champagne, he crafts his music in a deeply introspective space. This isolation isn’t loneliness—it’s intentional focus.\n“Whatever vibe I’m on at the time is usually what comes out in the music.”\nThis ability to channel the present moment is what gives his music authenticity. Unlike many artists who rely heavily on producers or co-writers, Major D-Star’s voice, both literal and figurative, remains undiluted. He’s not chasing hits; he’s archiving his life.\nThe Echoes of Biggie: A Legacy of Reinvention\nMajor D-Star’s reverence for Biggie Smalls is not just homage—it’s a blueprint. Biggie’s ability to be versatile, evolve, and still maintain lyrical integrity resonates deeply with D-Star’s own aspirations.\n“It was all a dream! Sky’s the limit was the mindset, but now it’s universal!”\nThis metaphor is more than motivational fluff; it’s the foundation of D-Star’s philosophy. The pursuit isn’t fame for fame’s sake. It’s about pushing boundaries, rewriting narratives, and refusing to stagnate.\nCreative Freedom vs. the Industry Machine\nOne of the most compelling elements of D-Star’s journey is his relationship with the industry itself. Despite offers from major labels, he continues to operate independently.\n“Creative control is very important for me…”\nThis stance speaks volumes in an age where many artists sacrifice ownership for exposure. D-Star’s long-game approach—building leverage, nurturing authentic connections, and trusting his music to do the talking—is a lesson in sustainability. Star power, after all, isn’t given—it’s earned.\nFrom the Stars to Therapy: Music as Healing\nFor D-Star, music is more than expression; it’s healing. He describes his inspiration as cosmic and constant, originating from childhood wonder and evolving into adult therapy. That’s why songs likeFor Granted / Move Onhit differently—they’re not manufactured emotions; they’re metabolized ones.\nThe Road Ahead: New Music, Major Mondays, and Major Moves\nLooking forward, Major D-Star is not slowing down. With new singles dropping monthly, a full-length album in the works, and the promise of major collaborations (still under wraps), he’s setting the stage for his biggest year yet.\nHis recurring “Major Mondays” content releases are more than just promo—they’re consistent reminders of his presence, growth, and unmatched work ethic. For fans and new listeners alike, it’s an invitation to witness evolution in real-time.\nFAQs about Major D-Star and “For Granted / Move On”\nQ1: What inspired the song “For Granted / Move On”?A: It’s based on real past relationships and how often good men are overlooked. It’s a reflection of personal growth and emotional healing.\nQ2: Who is Major D-Star’s biggest influence?A: The late Notorious B.I.G., particularly for his versatility and ability to improve with every track.\nQ3: Why does he prefer working alone in the studio?A: He values solitude to stay focused and free from distractions, often accompanied by wine or champagne to celebrate future wins.\nQ4: Has Major D-Star signed with a major label?A: Not yet. He’s received offers but prioritizes creative control and building leverage before signing.\nQ5: What’s next for Major D-Star?A: A full album with major features is on the way, along with monthly single releases and weekly “Major Mondays” content drops.\nQ6: Where can I hear more from Major D-Star?A: Visit his official site atmajordstar.net, or check out his music onYouTube.\nConclusion: A Voice for the Undervalued\nMajor D-Star’sFor Granted / Move Onis more than just two tracks—it’s a narrative arc, a soul-searching letter, and a cultural statement. It speaks to anyone who has loved deeply, lost painfully, and come out wiser. With unmatched integrity and a vision rooted in authenticity, Major D-Star proves that while pain may be temporary, good music—and good men—endure.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "MidwestKing on the Mic: BLIZZARD-G Unpacks His Journey Through Beats and Truth",
        "description": "\nFrom the heart of Chicago’s South Side to the vibrant streets of St. Louis, BLIZZARD-G—also known as The MidwestKing—has carved out a space in hip-hop that’s equal parts gritty, grounded, and globally-minded.\nHis latest project, 6pak, is a bold testament to his journey, packed with six dynamic tracks that showcase his lyrical sharpness, Midwest pride, and unshakable vision. In this candid interview, BLIZZARD-G opens up about the origins of his stage name, the realities behind the bars, and what’s next for an artist who’s doing it all independently.\nInterview with BLIZZARD-G aka The MidwestKing\n1. You grew up in Chicago but are now based in St. Louis—how have both cities shaped your sound and outlook as an artist?\nChicago and St. Louis both played major roles in shaping who I am. I soaked up the lingo and culture from both cities, which made it easy for me to blend styles and perspectives. It’s given me a unique edge and voice that stands out.\n2. How did the moniker “The MidwestKing” come to be, and what does it represent for you personally and musically?\nI’ve lived all over the Midwest—Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Indiana, Minnesota—you name it. I’m a natural-born leader, and The MidwestKing doesn’t mean I’m the best, it means I stand out the most. My influence in style and voice speaks for itself.\n3. When did you first realize you wanted to rap professionally, and which moment in your early career will you never forget?\nI knew I wanted to rap professionally when I saw other artists change their lives—and their communities—with one hit. I’ll never forget when my Uncle DD took me to Soldier Field as a kid. He was playing trumpet and trombone for the Chicago Bears, and that moment lit a fire in me.\n4. Walk us through your typical writing session—how do you sculpt those witty bars that cut through the noise?\nMy bars come straight from experience—what I’ve seen and lived. I’m pretty well-rounded and versatile, so when I write, I draw from real life and add charisma, sometimes a bit of exaggeration to keep it entertaining.\n5. 6pak is your latest project—what was the inspiration behind the title, and how did the EP come together from concept to completion?\nThe idea came from the structure—it’s six powerful tracks that are unique and relatable. Each song packs a punch, and together they form a tight, impactful collection.\n\n6. If you had to pick one song off 6pak that best encapsulates your current reality, which would it be and why?\nDefinitely “Global.” It’s self-explanatory—I’m bigger than people think. That song captures my ambition and the reality of how far I’ve come.\n7. Who did you work with on the beats and production? Any unexpected partnerships or studio moments worth sharing?\nCharles Stokes produces most of my beats and records me. Sometimes I make my own beats, rap on them, and record myself. We’ve got a good creative rhythm going.\n8. Your bars are known for their wit—what themes or stories recur in your writing, and how do you decide what to tackle next?\nI had a rough childhood—I was raised by my grandparents in Chicago’s Parkway Gardens (O Block) and the Wild Hundreds. That upbringing gives me endless material. I often reflect on those times and make it relatable, mixing in a little charisma and flair.\n9. Every artist faces challenges—what’s been the toughest hurdle in your journey so far, and how did you push through?\nRelocating from Chicago to St. Louis was tough. I didn’t know anyone, and I was homeless at one point. But that struggle inspired me to make something happen—it was fuel for the fire.\n10. Describe your live shows: how do you translate the energy of your recordings onto the stage?\nMy live shows are lit. That’s where I really connect with fans and potential fans. I bring my gritty style and raw energy to the stage—it’s an experience.\n11. Which rappers, poets, or other creatives have had the biggest impact on your style and philosophy?\nJames Brown, for the soul in his voice. ODB (Ol’ Dirty Bastard) for his wild creativity. And my Uncle John John—he had that schizophrenic charisma that stuck with me.\n12. How do you engage with your fans off- and online, and what’s one fan interaction that really stuck with you?\nI show up in the community—help during natural disasters, give free haircuts to the homeless, just do what I can to rebuild. I believe in real connection beyond the screen.\n13. As someone forging an independent path, what advice would you give to up-and-coming rappers trying to break in today?\nNever give up. Keep going, even when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.\n14. Beyond 6pak, what projects or experiments are you most excited about exploring next?\nI’ve got a project coming up with my son, which is special. I’m also working on a solo project featuring artists like T-Rell.\n15. Ten years from now, when people look back on BLIZZARD-G’s career, what do you hope they remember most about The MidwestKing’s contribution to hip-hop?\nThat I was the biggest independent artist ever—and that I always gave back to my community. I want to be remembered as someone who made a real difference.\n\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

From that point forward, the show turned into the high-energy, unscripted chaos fans love.\nFromWildstyle battlesto rapid-fire punchlines, and Stockton crowd members pulled into skits and games — the experience felt personal, not just part of a tour route.\nAt its core,hip hop stayed front and center. Whether through rhyme games, battles, or bars spit straight off the dome, the cast treated the mic like a weapon and the crowd like co-stars. The Stockton audience was fully locked in — laughing, shouting, reacting — and feeding off every beat drop and bar landed.\n\nClosing out the night,DaBabyhit the stage and didn’t waste a second. His set was tight and aggressive — no filler. He performed“Suge,” “BOP,” “Shake Sumn,”and more, pacing the stage with the confidence of a true closer. No hype men. No distractions. Just him, his voice, and the crowd. At one point, he reached over the barricade to interact directly with fans, sending the arena into one last eruption.\n\nWild N Out Stocktonwasn’t just a stop on a tour — it was a cultural reset for the city. A sold-out show, built with community, driven by music, and packed with energy the 209 will be talking about for years.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

Rooted in the city’s creative pulse yet expansive in his reach, this multi-hyphenate artist has emerged as a standout voice in what he proudly calls *Psychedelic Soul sound that’s less a genre and more a feeling.\nManasseh’s journey didn’t start on stage or in a studio. It began at home, harmonizing with his mother and absorbing the emotion-laced delivery of church choirs. That spiritual foundation seeps into every layer of his music today. There’s a reverence in his tone, a soulful intention in every note that feels both nostalgic and forward-facing.\nOver the years, his presence has grown steadily, catching the attention of cultural institutions like WTTW, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Science and Industry, AudioTree, and most recently, Vocalo. In 2023, he was nominated for *Best R\\&B Artist by the *Chicago Reader*-a testament to both his artistry and the genuine connection he creates with listeners.\nAnd now, he’s getting ready to expand his soundscape even further with his forthcoming project, *R & B(eyond)*. More than justan album title, it’s a statement of intent. Manasseh isn’t just making rhythm and blues -he’s pushing past its borders, blending soul, psychedelia, and personal history into something wholly his own.\nTrue to form, *R & B(eyond)* promises to be an experience-rich with texture, emotion, and unexpected turns. If previous releases hinted at his range, this next chapter aims to fully reveal it.\nWhether through headphones or a live set, Manasseh makes music you feel first, then think about later. With *R & B(eyond)* on the horizon, one thing is clear: he’s not just making a sound. He’s building a world.\nLinks:https://linktr.ee/yomanasseh\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nIn the heart of Chicago, there’s something beautiful growing-and her name is Liv Roskos. Her new EP, Growing Pains, isn’t just a collection of songs. It’s a living, breathing story of personal growth, heartbreak, healing, and self-discovery. But behind every great artist is often someone helping to shape the vision, and for Liv, that person is producer Ike Nichols.Ike is more than just a producer. He’s a multi-instrumentalist who literally brought these songs to life. On most of the tracks, he played three to four instruments himself- everything from keys to strings to percussion. But it wasn’t just about playing the right notes. Ike helped Liv find the heart of each record. He coached vocals, built out harmonies, and even helped shape ad-libs. His touch gave the EP that live-in-studio energy, the kind of vibe that makes you feel like you’re right there in the room where the magic happened.\n“Working with Ike was like having a full band, a vocal coach, and a creative partner all in one,” Liv said. “He really helped me bring the emotion out.”\nFrom the smooth and sultry “Morning Love” to the aching honesty in “Lost In Myself,” the music takes you through every shade of emotion. You can hear the growing pains in her voice, the moments of doubt, the moments of peace. It’s soul music in the truest sense- the music takes you through every shade of emotion. You can hear the growing pains in her voice, the moments of doubt, the moments of peace. It’s soul music in the truest sense- music that touches something real.\nThe EP was released independently but got strong support from Chicago’s creative community. Liv’s been active in local spaces like Overflow Coffee and working with OAD Productions, helping build platforms for artists who don’t always get the spotlight. This isn’t just about music-it’s about storytelling, healing, and showing up fully as yourself.\nWith Growing Pains, Liv Roskos is showing the world what it sounds like when you put your soul into every note. And with Ike Nichols by her side, she’s created a body of work that’s both deeply personal and widely relatable.\nGo spin Growing Pains. You’ll feel every second of it.\nListen to Liv Roskos: Streaming now on all platformsFollow her on IG:@livroskosFollow Ike Nichols:@ikenicholsmusic\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nThere’s something about the way Flxxxn wears his story—bold, permanent, and unapologetically inked across every inch of his body. But this isn’t your typical tattooed model. This is a man who’s lived a hundred lives in just a few years: from surviving prison to redefining what a comeback looks like, Flxxxn is a walking masterpiece of resilience, ambition, and raw California energy.\nNow, he’s taking that energy to the big stage as a contestant in Inked Magazine’sOriginalscompetition, where he’s vying for a $25,000 prize that could change everything.\nHis Ink Tells the Truth\nFlxxxn’s most recent tattoo isn’t just ink—it’s a philosophy.“My back piece started off simple,” he says.“Just a Crip design. But after I finished portraits of Tupac and Nipsey Hussle on my legs, my celly in prison told me,‘If you get any man tatted on you, it should beyou—because you’re just as great.’That sat with me. He was right.”\n\nSo Flxxxn did exactly that. He got a portrait ofhimself—holding the world in his hands, wrapped in a Gucci ManeEvil Geniusalbum cover, layered with a map of his city and a message of dominance:From the hood, to take over the world.\nEach tattoo is like a track on a legendary mixtape—moments that reflect transformation, purpose, and power. And like all the best storytellers, he doesn’t need to say much. His skin speaks for itself.\nIf His Ink Could Talk…\n“It would tell you I survived what most couldn’t,” he says.“It would tell you how I lived multiple lives. I went from the streets to the gym, from the fast life to chasing peace, all while staying rooted in Black excellence.”\n\nPalm trees and lowriders pay homage to California. Motivational quotes etched in fine single-needle lines serve as a reminder: greatness is earned, not given. Some tattoos were done inside prison—where mirrors are rare, but transformation is real.\nThe $25K Plan: Legacy Moves Only\nFlxxxn isn’t just trying to win a contest—he’s trying to reclaim his life.\nThe $25,000 grand prize isn’t for flexing.“I’m two years out. I need my own space,” he says.“I live with friends, but my kids are getting older. I want a place with a guest room so they can stay with me.”\nBut he’s thinking bigger than rent and car notes.“I’m gonna open my own gym studio too. I’m a trainer, and that’s my way out of porn. I want a legit way to provide and build something real.”\n\nThe Rockstar Hustle with a Purpose\nFlxxxn is proof that you can live wild and still move with intention. That you can have a past, and still build a future. That you can turn the ink on your body into a roadmap toward something legendary.\nSo whether you’re a fan of tattoos, transformation, or true stories that hit harder than a verse from‘Pac—keep your eye on Flxxxn. He’s not just competing for the title ofOriginal, heisthe original. The only one who can turn a prison tattoo gun into a paintbrush—and his life into a canvas worth a million stories.\n© 2025,Logan.

        "description": "\nIn what promises to be one of the most talked-about books of 2025, Don Kilam’s “United States Of Pimpin’: Top Ten Things I Learned From PIMPIN’ That Applies To The Corporate System” is already taking the hip hop literary world by storm with pre-order sales far exceeding expectations. The book is set for release on June 20th, 2025 in both paperback and hardcover editions, exclusively on Amazon.\nKilam’s latest work is an audacious exploration of the parallels between the streetwise strategies of the pimp game and the often cutthroat tactics found within corporate systems. By sharing personal experiences in street culture, Kilam provocatively draws connections between these seemingly disparate worlds. Each chapter elucidates one of ten rules from the pimping world, comparingthem with principles that govern societal and corporate behavior.\nThe book is quickly gaining attention for its candid and, at times, uncomfortable truths about love, loyalty, and power dynamics—challenging readers to reconsider deeply held assumptions about the structures that influence their lives. It serves as a call to action, urging individuals to reclaim personal identity and authority amidst external pressures and societal gamesmanship.\nWith predictions suggesting initial sales could soar between 25,000 to 50,000 copies within just weeks of its release, “United States Of Pimpin’” is set to become a significant cultural touchstone. Its appeal lies in its unique approach, blending street wisdom with corporate knowledge, making it a must-read for those seeking to understand and navigate the complexities of modern life.\nDon Kilam’s work not only provides a lens into the overlaps between two worlds but also inspires readers towards self-empowerment and leadership. As anticipation builds, “United States Of Pimpin’” is poised to ignite conversations about freedom, identity, and the pursuit of autonomy within the systems that shape our existence.\nhttps://a.co/d/cknHr5b\n© 2025,Logan.

        "description": "\nHip-hop artist Jakkah has just released“Floating”, a fresh single that finds the perfect balance between late-night mood and street edge. Featuring fellow rapper Tyler Loyal, the track brings two different energies into one seamless record that’s easy to run back more than once.\nFrom the start,Floatingsets a laid-back,nocturnaltone. Jakkah rides the beat with a smooth, melodic flow that pulls the listener in—dropping lines that feel effortless but deliberate. There’s a slickness to the way he flows through the instrumental, offering what I can describe as moments of cool reflection and subtle flexes without overdoing it haha – It honestly is a dope record and his chill laid back style accommodates the instrumental so well!\nThe beat itself is clean with a steady bounce, and enough space for each verse to breathe. When Tyler Loyal steps in, the mood shifts. His delivery is more direct—gritty, sharp, and full of presence. He brings contrast to the track, but not in a way that disrupts it. Instead, the two styles play off each other, giving the song layers and movement.\nWhat stands out most aboutFloatingis how balanced it feels. It’s not just a showcase for either artist—it’s a collaboration where both get to shine. Jakkah sets the tone, and Tyler pushes it forward. There’s clarity in the verses, strength in the hook, and a cool, confident energy throughout.\nJakkah and Tyler Loyal show us just how two distinct sounds can come together and create a unique sounding record that actually slaps! Hiphopsince1987 is proud to include it not only in our editorial write-up but also our playlists as well!\nFloatingis now streaming everywhere. Keep up with Jakkah and Tyler Loyal on Instagram and tap into their growing catalog—you might just find your next favorite song.\nListen Now:Stream “Floating” on Spotify\nFollow the Artists:@jakkahmusic@tylerloyal\n© 2025,Variety Press.

Straight outta Los Angeles, DDPresents, and Salt Lake City’s PAINLIKESHADOWS are the masterminds behind this haunting, high-energy remix, pullin’ in Smokepurpp and Almighty Jay as featured heavyweights. With 808s that pound like a heartbeat in a storm, eerie synths creepin’ like fog over the city, and drums so crisp they cut deep, this track channels the nocturnal grit of Night Lovell and $uicideboy$. It’s made for late-night drives through LA’s neon streets or straight chaos in a packed club. This ain’t just a track, it’s a manifesto from two risers ready to etch their names in hip-hop’s soul.\n\nDDPresents is a triple-threat artist, songwriter, and audio engineer who’s been building a cult following with his relentless output. Tracks like “COBAIN” and his vast catalog (hundreds of releases across platforms) showcase his knack for blending trap, cloud rap, and experimental hip-hop. For “DARK KNIGHT – Shadows Mix,” DDPresents takes the helm, crafting a production that’s both menacing and immersive. His hands-on approach, from beat-making to mixing, gives the track its polished yet raw edge.\nPAINLIKESHADOWS, hailing from Salt Lake City, Utah, a mysterious figure in the underground, brings an equally vital voice to the remix.

DDPresents’ influence shines in the hook—a hypnotic, chant-like refrain built for TikTok virality, perfect for slow-motion car vids or streetwear montages. It’s a track that demands repeat listens, revealing new layers with each spin. His 2023 single “Grim Reaper,” with over 3 million YouTube views and 1.4 million Spotify streams, cemented his cult following in cloud rap.\n“DARK KNIGHT – Shadows Mix” is more than a remix, it’s a manifesto.

        "description": "\nThere’s something about Manasseh’s presence on the mic that feels less like a performance and more like a sermon. Not the type you hear on Sunday morning with stained glass behind you—but the kind that meets you where you are: in your car, in your headphones, in the middle of your mess. He’s not singing just to entertain. He’s singing to remind you—there’s still power in truth.\nHis latest work proves that the booth can be a pulpit. Each verse, a reflection. Each note, a wake-up call. Manasseh doesn’t shy away from the heaviness—he leans into it. He sings about systems, trauma, faith, and freedom like someone who’s been through the fire and came out with vision, not just survival.\nWhat separates him from the noise isn’t just skill (though his vocal delivery is serious). It’s the intent. There’s purpose in his pain. A melody in his resistance. A fire in his delivery that makes even the most distracted listener stop scrolling and start listening.\nManasseh’s sound lives at the intersection of R&B, soul, and sacred rebellion. In a world full of artists trying to numb you, he’s one of the few trying to wake you up. That’s not just rare—it’s necessary.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nIn a culture constantly chasing what’s next, there’s something grounding—almost divine—about an artist who brings us back to truth. Manasseh isn’t trying to be trendy. He’s not chasing clout or mimicking the masses. He’s carving his own lane, one rooted in spirit, struggle, and sound. And whether the world is ready or not, the moment belongs to him.\nRaised between scripture and street corners, Manasseh’s voice carries the weight of someone who’s seen both sides of life’s coin. His music feels like prophecy over a beat—soulful, raw, and unfiltered. Whether he’s flipping verses that echo the Psalms or pouring out pain from a place that’s deeper than surface wounds, it’s clear this isn’t entertainment for him. This is mission.\nTracks like “Old Time Sake” showcase not just lyricism but vulnerability, letting listeners step into the studio with him—into the booth, into the process, into the prayer. It’s almost impossible to listen passively. His cadence grabs you, his conviction moves you, and his content? It leaves a mark.\nIn an era where everybody’s performing, Manasseh is simply speaking. And that’s what makes it hit harder. The sound is cinematic. The emotion is real. The message is needed. And the moment—this moment—it’s his.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nFrom the small town ofBunkie, Louisianato the wide-open energy ofHouston,BigCruz—also known asMr. Possie—is proving you don’t need a major label or viral gimmick to make major noise. His single“7 Grams of Weed”charted on iTunes, and his most recent project broke into the Top 10. But for BigCruz, the music’s always been about more than just numbers.\nIn anexclusive interview onVigilantes Radio Livevia iHeartRadio, he opens up about his beginnings, his evolution, and the mindset that keeps him focused on building something real.\n“Success? It’s working hard at something you always wanted to achieve—getting it done the way you always saw it, dreamed it, talked about it.”\nWhen asked what success looks like to him, he keeps it honest: he’s not there yet. And that’s not a lack of vision—it’s a reminder that he’s just getting started.\n“I haven’t reached my fullest potential yet. This is the beginning.”\n\nA Self-Made Start\nBigCruz discovered his love for rap at just ten years old. No mentors, no label, no studio guidance, just a young artist figuring it out on his own. He taught himself how to write bars, build songs, and shape his sound. If rap hadn’t been the path, he says,R&Bmight’ve been next. But hip-hop gave him the space to be raw and real.\nNow he’s not just writing and recording, he’s learning the business, mastering his sound, and investing in long-term growth.\n“The more I dedicate to it, it’s gonna come to fruition.”\nThis is bigger than singles or social buzz. BigCruz is building something that can last.\nThe Mission’s Changed\nAt one point, BigCruz had his sights set on a major label deal. These days, he’s still open to that lane—but only on his terms.\n“I still want the major, but I wanna do it in a way where I can stay independent—play it smart.”\nThat mindset mirrors what a lot of artists are feeling right now. Clout isn’t enough. Ownership, control, and strategy? That’s the real game.\n\nReady for the Moment\nWhen “7 Grams of Weed” charted, BigCruz didn’t act surprised.\n“I was ready for this.”\nThere was no fake humility, no theatrics. Just a calm, focused response from someone who’s been putting in the work long before the spotlight showed up. Born in Bunkie, now based in Houston, BigCruz moves with quiet confidence—and Southern intensity.\n“This is just the beginning.”\nThis Isn’t a Feature—It’s a Foundation\nBigCruz isn’t chasing trends. He’s laying bricks—one song, one session, one move at a time. His music hits because it’s built on real experiences, real emotions, and real intention.\nThis isn’t hype. It’s groundwork.\n\nTap In:\nOfficial iHeartRadio Interview – Vigilantes Radio Livehttps://www.iheart.com/podcast/966-vigilantes-radio-live-29999229/episode/the-bigcruz-aka-mr-possie-interview-280005789/\n“Alone” (Official Music Video) – Directed by @highlyconfidenthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz_Kkltv-hI\nMr. Possie aka BigCruz – LinkTreehttps://linktr.ee/mrpossie\nArtist Profile on UnitedMastershttps://unitedmasters.com/a/bigcruz\nStream “7 Grams of Weed”https://unitedmasters.com/m/7-grams-of-weed\n© 2025,Logan.

Jordan. Growing up amid instability and financial hardship, music became Woods’ escape. As a child, he would drown out the chaos with headphones and entertain family with raps and dances during gatherings.\nRaised by teenage parents, Woods was exposed to both classic soul and the golden age of hip-hop, shaping his appreciation for the evolution of music. Influenced by artists with similar upbringings, he began recording in middle school, promoting his group with handmade flyers and custom gear—methods he still uses in artist marketing today.\nInspired by business-minded moguls like Master P, Birdman, and J. Prince, Woods chose to retain control over his music career. That plan paused when he joined the Army after becoming a teen father, but the experience developed into resilience and leadership skills that later fueled his transition from artist to executive.\nAs a promoter, Woods booked national tours and partnered with Atlanta’s Onyx Gentleman’s Club, working with artists such as MoneyMan, Kap G, Derez DeShon, and others. His impact caught the attention of Elliot Stroud of Grand Hustle, where Woods served as an A&R executive. There, he worked with major names like Moneybagg Yo, Boosie, Yo Gotti, Kodak Black, and B. Simone—curating sounds, placing records, and reviving careers for artists like Young Dro and Jhonni Blaze. He executive produced Big Boogie’s breakout hitMental Healing(138M+ views) and theDefinition of Big Dudeproject, which charted at #17 on Billboard.\n\nFollowing the passing of Bankroll Fresh, Woods worked closely with the artist’s family to preserve his legacy. He continues to champion emerging talent throughHollipalooza, one of the longest-running indie showcases, hosted alongside DJ Holiday and Keith Fergus. Over the past decade, the platform has spotlighted early performances from Young Dolph, Lil Durk, Megan Thee Stallion, Bobby Shmurda, and others.\nWoods’ PR agency,The Umbrella Firm, has secured client placements on major outlets likeThe Breakfast Cluband recently inked a label deal for his companyGoat Mode Productionswith The Orchard and Beatroot Music. He is also an IMDb-credited actor, appearing in Boosie’sMy StruggleandThe Dark Moon Rising.\nToday, Woods is deeply involved in youth advocacy throughThe Rosie Mae Foundation, named in honor of his late grandmother, and as a facilitator forCredible Messengers/OAA. He collaborates with the State Attorney’s Office, Department of Juvenile Justice, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, supported by Quavo’s Rocket Foundation. His outreach has led to meetings with the NFL, Vice President Kamala Harris, Mayor Andre Dickens, and others.\nFrom overcoming stereotypes to breaking generational cycles, Woods continues to thrive—living out his purpose through music, mentorship, and leadership.\n© 2025,Logan.

        "title": "DDPresents, No1-Noah, and Steele 11 Pour Heart and Soul into 2020 R&B-Trap Crossover “Stay”",
        "description": "\n“Stay” is a vibe-soaked collaboration between rising independent force ddpresents, R&B phenom No1-Noah, and the elusive wordsmith Steele 11. Dropped in April 2020, the single fuses moody trap percussion with smooth R&B melodies, creating a sound that feels both cinematic and intimate. It’s the kind of track that soundtracks a quiet drive home or a restless 2AM scroll through old messages — raw, honest, and unforgettable.\n“Stay” emerged during a moment when each artist was building serious underground momentum. ddpresents, known for blurring the lines between hip-hop, alt-pop, and experimental soul, linked up with No1-Noah, who was fresh off a buzzworthy collab streak with Summer Walker, and Steele 11, a rapper whose lowkey delivery cuts straight through the mix like a cold truth.\n\nThis wasn’t a record made in some boardroom—it’s the product of raw energy and mutual respect between artists carving their own lane. Released independently on all major streaming platforms, “Stay” is a testament to what happens when real emotion meets real collaboration.\nBuilt around gliding synths, spaced-out 808s, and melodies that stick, “Stay” lives in the pocket between R&B and melodic trap. You’ll hear autotuned croons, but they don’t hide behind the effect—they lean into it, amplifying every ounce of heartbreak and hesitation.\n\nBut the vocal dynamics are where it hits hardest. No1-Noah brings that aching smoothness, ddpresents delivers slick melodic bars with a vulnerable edge, and Steele 11 balances the floaty textures with grounded lyricism.\nLyrically, it’s all about wanting that one person to stay—when pride and fear get blurred, and all that’s left is the feeling.\nThough it never hit the Billboard charts, “Stay” made its rounds on social media and niche music blogs, gaining traction for its authenticity and polished production. Fans praised the track for being both emotionally open and musically sleek—a rare combo in a world full of flex-first records.\n\nOn TikTok, clips of the hook started showing up in soft edits, mood boards, and breakup skits—proof that the emotional resonance was landing with Gen Z and young millennials alike.\n“Stay” fits perfectly into the cultural wave of late-2010s and early-2020s melodic rap, where artists aren’t afraid to get in their feelings. Think Bryson Tiller meets Juice WRLD, with a splash of PartyNextDoor. But it still holds its own—this isn’t copycat content; it’s part of the evolution.\nAs independent artists, ddpresents, No1-Noah, and Steele 11 didn’t just drop a song—they dropped a statement. No gimmicks. No major label push. Just vibes, truth, and talent.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\n“Never Again” is a song by American artists DDPresents and Trilla Kid, released as a single in 2019. The track, available on streaming platforms such as Spotify, is a melodic rap and trap collaboration that explores themes of heartbreak, betrayal, and personal resilience. Known for its emotive lyricism and atmospheric production, “Never Again” has gained attention within the independent music scene, particularly among fans of emo-rap and melodic trap.\n“Never Again” was independently released in 2019 through digital platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud. The song is a collaboration between DDPresents, an emerging artist known for blending hip-hop, pop, and electronic influences, and Trilla Kid, a melodic rapper from Atlanta, Georgia, recognized for his introspective storytelling and vocal style reminiscent of Lil Uzi Vert. Both artists operate within the independent music scene, utilizing streaming platforms to distribute their work directly to listeners.\nThe release of “Never Again” coincided with Trilla Kid’s growing recognition, following the success of tracks like “LUV” and “Dark Days,” which gained traction through online platforms. The song reflects the artists’ shared affinity for emo-rap, a genre popularized in the late 2010s by artists like Juice WRLD and Lil Peep, characterized by emotional vulnerability and melodic instrumentation.\n\n“Never Again” is a melodic rap and trap song featuring a moody instrumental with deep 808 basslines, sharp hi-hats, and atmospheric synths. The track employs autotune to enhance the emotional depth of the vocals, a hallmark of the emo-rap and melodic trap genres. Its structure consists of alternating verses from DDP and Trilla Kid, culminating in a repetitive, anthemic chorus centered on the phrase “never again.”\nThe lyrics explore themes of heartbreak and the determination to avoid repeating past relational mistakes. DDPresents’ verses convey introspection and the pain of betrayal, while Trilla Kid’s contributions add raw intensity, reflecting on emotional recovery and personal growth. The chorus serves as a universal declaration of empowerment, resonating with listeners who have experienced toxic relationships or personal setbacks. The song’s thematic content aligns with Trilla Kid’s broader discography, which often addresses emotional struggles and lost love, as seen in tracks like “PIECES OF MY HEART” and “BY MYSELF AGAIN.”\n“Never Again” has cultivated a niche following within the underground hip-hop and emo-rap communities.

        "description": "\nTell Us About Yourself:\nI was born Texan and raised Ugandan. I’ve always been in love with music since I was a crawling jit and my mom would tell me how I would love watching MTV (music television network) and I memorized the channel number (back when I lived in Uganda). Goes to show you how fascinated I was by artists like Chris Brown, Jeremih, Migos, Young Thug, Ye and Wayne. I would grow up and learn how to download music of my own and I discovered artists like Travis scott, SchoolboyQ, Gunna, etc but I wanna highlight 21 Savage, he made me wanna start making music. The shallow and monotone his voice is on his songs and his beat selection caught my attention one day I just found myself freestyling in the shower to the “Disrespectful” beat. From that day on I had a mission and that was before I moved to the states 5 years ago. When I moved, I knew it was my opportunity but I didn’t know how to record, what to use or where to record at yet. Then a couple of my homies laid the path for me. They were recording on bandlab and the lightbulb hit. I locked myself in the closet with apple earphone mic and some silence. That’s how it started and fast forward, i’m still using bandlab but on my computer and I have an actual mic now and my engineering skills are mastering.\n$CoMmEnt²\nMy song’s “daze” and “freezin feet” really showcase what my new development as evolved into. I’ve been a person with social anxiety due to dealing with friends who turn out to not be friends so I start to think if i’m the problem, I spend hundreds of dollars on myself to make me feel better and if anyone throws a punch, i’m throwing a chair! eye for an eye but its really eye for 2 eyes. What I would wanna do is just smoke and daze away all that negative energy. This is what “daze’ is about. “freezin feet” is really me crying out to myself that I gotta get out of my comfort zone and stop being lazy too much when there is my whole life ahead of me and I’m slowing myself down.\n\nEnough of that though, I am set and ready to shine. Russee putting his foot down. Coming out of my shell. I ain’t scared no more. I’m showing you, proving to you how bad I want this. Nobody want this like I do.\n\nInstagram: russeetf\nHometown: Denver\nDOB: 04/22/2004\nInspired by: Travis scott, 21 Savage, Playboi Carti\nYouTube:https://www.youtube.com/@russeetf\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "title": "“The King of Instrumental Pop” Dom Okon Announces on Instagram that Fourth album titled Mystified is in Production",
        "description": "\nDom Okon is an acclaimed musician who has released three blockbuster albums (Youthly, Emergent and Just Dom) as of now. All three of these albums have shattered records for the artist in the instrumental pop music genre. On Friday January 3rd, Okon announced that he has a fourth record titled Mystified in production. His Instagram post was vague and didn’t leave much details except for the release date of the album which is held to be in October of this year. Dom Okon is no stranger to releasing albums as he’s produced three albums in three years with each finding measurable success on the ITunes Top 100 charts.\nMystified would be The King of Instrumental Pop’s fourth album out in the market. It is interesting to see how Okon will evolve with this record and the story he looks to tell with this album. It can be rumored based off the album title that this collection of songs may hint at mystery in some sorts. This mystery may involve Dom Okon directly or maybe tell a story about a secret larger than the instrumental pop sensation. Only time will tell as very little information is available about the Mystified album. To learn more updates about Dom Okon’s music you can check out his Instagram page, YouTube channel among other social media platforms of his.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Pepe Dadon: Talk Recent Sound, Upcoming Release, & Self Code",
        "description": "\nIn the fast-paced world of music, it’s rare to find an artist who maintains such an authentic connection to their craft. Pepe Dadon, a rising star from Brooklyn, New York, is that artist. His approach to music isn’t just about catchy hooks or flashy verses; it’s about personal connection, raw emotion, and a deep desire to uplift his community. We recently sat down with Dadon to talk about his musical journey, creative process, and how he stays grounded in an industry that often prioritizes trends over truth.\nMusic as a Form of Release andReflection\nFor Pepe, music has always been more than a way to pass the time it’s a powerful form of therapy. “The vibrations music can change are exponential, so it’s always been a big factor in my life,” he explains. “Beyond listening to it, making it has its own outlet of release. It’s therapeutic to relate to the line in the song you’re writing or recording when you know where it’s coming from, rather than having to search for it.”\nThis deep connection to sound is something that drives Pepe’s approach to his art. Whether he’s recording alone or collaborating with others, each song is a personal experience a chance to break free from his surroundings and connect with the world around him. “That relation to sound is what creates a break from your surroundings, no matter where you are or what it’s being played off of,” he shares. “Where you stand to soil your feet should be the same and with purpose wherever your music goes.”\nA Shift in Drive: The Impact of DarkMoments\nPepe also speaks openly about how difficult moments in his life have shaped his drive for music. “Those dark moments of being put on case changed my drive for music and passion,” he admits. For him, music became a way to process those challenging times and channel his energy into something positive. But it’s not just about self-expression; Pepe also wants his music to elevate others, particularly the youth in his community. “Not only trying to elevate the youth and those in need through community service but expanding my horizon by collaborating with new artists to seasoned ones to expand knowledge,” he says. Pepe’s commitment to both his personal growth and community service is a driving force behind much of his music and his artistic journey.\nINERTIA : TheMotion\nWhen asked about a specific song or project that took a surprising turn during the creativeprocess,Dadon smiles and nods. “Everything is like that. I go in with the mentality to give my verse or time on the mic the best effort,” he says. But one project stands out as a major shift in sound : INERTIA, set to release in January 2025.\n“Inertia, Volume One, is deeper than just some head bumpers,” he explains. “It’s a display of motion being circulated regardless at what level it’s being done at, what’s put in motion stays in motion here.” The project is a reflection of movement and momentum, a physical and emotional force that reflects Pepe’s own evolution as an artist. But what makes this project even more unique is the collaborative, group-based process behind it. “All of the sessions for these songs were group- involved, and recorded off link-ups with vibes,” he shares. The album is designed to be a collective effort, with influences from people beyond just fellow musicians—members who aren’t artists, but who have indirectly contributed to the project’s energy and direction.\nPepe is eager to share the results with the world, and he’s not stopping with just one volume. “The second volume of Inertia is already in progress, and it will comply with straight hot weather and good feelings,” he says, referencing the vibe he hopes to capture for warmer seasons. It’s clear that for Pepe, the music is as much about the atmosphere and collective energy as it is about the sounditself.\nStaying True to Himself in an Industry ofTrends\nWith all the pressures that come with the music industry—constant comparisons, ever-changing trends, and the desire to stay relevant—many artists can lose sight of who they really are. But for Pepe Dadon, staying authentic is paramount. “Real ways can’t be taught,” he reflects. “That looks different for others than self, so I never set the president of my values upon others. I’ve always carried who I am the same.”\nThis unwavering authenticity is what keeps Pepe grounded amidst the noise of an often image- driven industry. “Showing love when you can is beyond a moment—it shows a sense of trust to be vulnerable and pure to those you encounter,” he says. He walks through life with faith, a guiding force that fuels his confidence to be himself, no matter the external pressures.\n“Do you at any level, then any level of yourself you want to reflect or manifest on, will always be driven towards stepping goals of the same picture,” he adds, his voice steady and assured. For him, love and authenticity are not just words—they are actions he lives by every day.\nLooking Ahead: The Future of PepeDadon\nAs Pepe continues to grow and evolve as an artist, his focus remains on creating music that is meaningful, impactful, and real. His commitment to his craft, his community, and his values ensures that his journey as an artist will be one that transcends trends and leaves a lasting impact.\n“When I imagine the future, I think of a sound that continues to touch people—no matter where they’re at in their own journey,” he shares. “I want to create something that feels timeless and true, something that anyone can relate to.”\nWith INERTIA on the horizon and more projects in the works, it’s clear that Pepe Dadon is just getting started. The message is simple, Stay true, keep pushing forward, and never stop moving.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Pepe Dadon: “Zoom” In Virtual Talk of Community and Collaboration in “Inertia” With Artist Pepe Dadon",
        "description": "\nIn a world where collaboration can sometimes feel like a forced trend, Pepe is doing it his way. As he gears up for the release of his highly anticipated project “Inertia”, it’s clear that for him, collaboration is not just about getting the right people in the room; it’s about tapping into the energy of the community around him. We caught up with Pepe in a Zoom interview, where he opened up about the deep connections fueling “Inertia”—a project built not just on musical talent, but on relationships, mutual inspiration, and authenticity.\nQ: You’ve hinted that the project was very collaborative, with some members of your community outside of music contributing to it. How did their involvement shape the final product?\nPepe: “From the fashion of friends and family evolving to the different styles of artists that bring to the studio, I feel like everything that’s been in the vicinity over the past six months has had a factor in this, whether small or big. Every gear pushes another.”\nFor Pepe, collaboration goes beyond simply working with other musicians—it’s about the entire ecosystem around him. He views the energy in his community, including family and friends, as a vital part of the creative process. The collective influence of all these people—whether directly or indirectly involved—shapes the final product.\n“Understanding that before I reach out to the unknown, I’m coded to try to reach it to those near to me first. For some, that comes with baggage of effort having to be provided, but each artist had nothing but the duty of being them to inspiring me, and I thank them to the fullest for that.”\nIn his view, each individual who contributed brought something uniquely important to the table, even if it was just their authentic self. For Pepe, the best kind of influence is not forced but rather organic and rooted in real relationships.\nQ: You’ve mentioned a pretty extensive list of collaborators. Who are some of the key people or groups that made a significant impact on this project?\nPepeDadon:\n“The list is extensive, but it consists of people like Aster Atlier, Mood Swings Clothing, Vandalize Arts, B2SLEEZ, Aster, Sha Santana, DreamBoy DZY, Trevo & Dono, Khriso, Royo, Valentinoo, Kyyle\nSwindelzz, Saiiskraz, B.Rich, Xav, 888 Madhouse, Latin, Moose, Jvuitton, ThroughTheLens, LB, Matt Kenzo, Beasley, Jean1of1, Middlenamered, G.1U, HumbleLani, Blkmagicjust, HighrollerAC, Itschris, JahMiri, Tyystaxkz, Jaicyyy, yayzoshiner.”\nThat’s just a small snapshot of the collective influence that Pepe’s community brought to the project. These names span not only musicians but also artists and creators from the world of fashion, art, and visual media. For him, each person brought a level of authenticity that allowed the project to reflect not just his journey, but a broader cultural pulse. The blend of different worlds— from streetwear designers to visual artists—has given “Inertia” a rich texture that reflects the diverse inspirations surrounding him.\nQ: That’s a powerful list of collaborators! How did this wide range of artists impact the sound of“Inertia”?\nPepe Dadon: “The influences of artistry who don’t have to maintain being authentic because they simply are. They just exist in their truth, and that energy bleeds into the work. That’s what I love about working with a community like this—everyone is already being who they are, no need to forceit.”\nPepe emphasizes that the magic happens when people show up simply as themselves. He’s not interested in forcing sounds or ideas into the project; instead, the focus is on capturing the raw energy that each person brings. This kind of effortless authenticity is what gives “Inertia” its powerful foundation, something that resonates with both the artist and the listener. When authenticity is the driving force, the music naturally follows suit.\nQ: It sounds like a very organic, community-driven project. You also mentioned that those who contributed will get an early listen of the project. Can you tell us more about that?\nPepe Dadon: “The send-out for their cosign on the project will touch their phones a week before release with U audio files.”\nFor Pepe, involving his community goes beyond simply collaborating on the music. He’s deeply committed to sharing the project with the people who helped shape it. A week before the official release, those who had a hand in the project will receive early access—an exclusive preview with U tracks. This gesture is not only a way of showing gratitude but also a symbolic passing of the torch. These are the people who have been there from the start, and Pepe is making sure they feel just as connected to the music as he does.\nQ: With all of these creative minds involved, how do you think this collective energy will translate to your audience?\nPepe Dadon: “The energy that went into making this project—it’s going to touch a lot of people. I believe when you put that much authenticity into something, it speaks for itself. It’s not just about the music; it’s about the vibe, the story, the culture behind it. I want my audience to feel the same passion that we put into it.”\nIt’s clear that Pepe Dadon views “Inertia” not just as an album but as a cultural statement. The energy and passion that went into the project are meant to resonate deeply with his audience. By weaving together the influences of his community—his friends, fellow artists, and collaborators— he’s aiming to create an experience that feels real, raw, and undeniably authentic. This isn’t just music; it’s a reflection of his world and the people who inspire him.\nQ:What’snextforyouafterthereleaseof“Inertia”?\nPepe Dadon: “After “Inertia,” I’m just going to keep moving. This is just the first volume, and the second one is already in progress. Each release will have a different vibe, but it all flows from the same energy. I’m excited to see where this journey goes next.”*\nLooking ahead, Pepe is already working on the next chapter of “Inertia,” with Volume Two already in progress. It’s clear that “Inertia” is just the beginning of an ongoing evolution for Pepe Dadon, both musically and personally. As he continues to create and expand his community, his music will undoubtedly evolve with it—pushing boundaries and exploring new territories.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "“Pepe Dadon: The Art of Love, Relationships, and Finding Balance in Music”",
        "description": "\nIn this candid, reflective podcast interview, we dive deep into the world of Pepe Dadon, a artist who’s been steadily carving his own path in the music world. With his highly anticipated project “Inertia” set to drop, we took the chance to explore not only his artistry but also how his relationships—both personal and professional—shape his creative process.\nWe asked Pepe Dadon about the balance between his emotional life and his music, how relationships influence his sound, and how he navigates the highs and lows of love while pursuing his artistic dreams.\nQ: You’ve talked about music as a form of therapy for you. When it comes to relationships, do you find that your emotional experiences—both good and bad—end up inspiring your music? Pepe Dadon:\n“Ifindthegoodinallsituationsandlessonsoflife,andI’massatisfiedtounderstandthatIneedto beappreciativeofhurtfromrelations—whethergoodorbad.Reflectionandreplanisalwaysthe next step. Being in relationships opens a new field because the protection piece I have up drops andgetsplacedinfrontofmywomanfromtheworld.”\nFor Pepe, emotional vulnerability is key. He acknowledges that relationships—especially romantic ones—expose raw feelings, making them a source of both growth and inspiration. What stands out is his mature outlook on pain. Rather than holding onto resentment, Pepe reflects on what he can learn from each experience, using that to fuel his creative journey.\n“TheemotionsIfeelinthatphasetapintopreviouswoundsthatevokemetospeakonmyfeelings duringasituationratherthanholdthebagofresentmenttowardsanyoneelsebutmyselffor getting got.”\nPepe’s honesty shines through here. It’s clear that his emotional growth, both in and out of relationships, deeply informs his songwriting. And by embracing the hurt and lessons learned, he crafts music that’s not just cathartic but relatable for his listeners.\nQ: When you’re in a relationship, how do those emotional ups and downs filter into the creative process? Do you find your music changes depending on where you are emotionally?\nPepeDadon:\n“It’sallaboutplanandmakingsurethatotherpersoncanseeyoureyeswiththepiecestoknowyou aren’tcrazytoo.IfI’mdown,thestudioismorethanaconfessionalroomforme,soit’seasytohave hourspassby.Tosomeonewhodoesn’tseeyourvisionanddriveforcreativity,it’shardtowrap their minds around waking up to do a project or song out my sleep before the sun comes up.”\nBeing in a relationship brings its own set of challenges when balancing personal emotions and creative output. Pepe acknowledges that while his emotional state does influence his music, the connection with his partner is equally important. He’s not just pouring his feelings into his music, he’s also working on the communication side ofthings.\n“Currenttimeandfeelingalwayschangeswithmusic,itinfluencesbutdoesn’trulemysound becausethenthemusicisforthemratherthanformeandwholovesme.Ican’tbeanythingoutside of that.”\nThis is where Pepe Dadon draws a line between his personal life and his artistry. His music may be inspired by his emotions, but at the end of the day, it’s his love and respect for those close to him that keep him grounded in his work. He doesn’t want his music to be dictated by anyone else’s expectations—especially when it comes to matters of the heart.\nQ: How do you know when you’re writing something deeply personal? Is there a moment where you have to decide whether or not to share those intimate emotions with your audience?\nPepeDadon:\n“There’s multiple ways to address something as an artist. I take perspective in knowing that thereare multiple ways I can speak on a situation from the flow I address it with. The power is in yourhands.”\nPepe is keenly aware of how much control he holds over the narrative in his music. As an artist, he chooses how deeply personal he gets, and whether or not to let his audience in on those moments. The beauty of music, for Pepe, lies in the ability to share pieces of himself without having to give it all away.\n“When writing for others, I find it’s easier to go into detail but generalize for more relation, for what the genre attracts.”\nThis speaks to Pepe’s adaptability as an artist. When it comes to writing for his audience, he strikes a balance between personal detail and universal themes. He’s learned that a good song isn’t just abouthisstory, but about creating something that resonates with others—while still staying true to who he is.\nQ: Do you think being in a healthy, supportive relationship makes you a better artist, or do you thrive in more turbulent times when there’s emotional chaos to work through?\nPepeDadon:\n“Mypurposeisrealheavy,soI’venevertakentheemotionalstatusofpreviousrelationshipsandlet it change who I am as a person. I want my significant other to be her own person as I will be mine. Ionly need the respect we give one another to match the treatment of knowing what’s out and inlineof the relationship.”\nHere, Pepe opens up about his view on relationships in general. He emphasizes that his purpose— his dedication to his craft—remains the driving force in his life. He doesn’t rely on the emotional rollercoasters of past relationships to shape who he is, because his personal identity is independent of that.\n“Everyoneparticipateswiththeirownrulestothatwhentheysetthestandardfortheirmoralsandprinciples.”\nWhat strikes here is how grounded Pepe is when it comes to relationships. He isn’t swayed by emotional highs or lows; instead, he focuses on respect, mutual understanding, and clarity of intention. These values are what keep his relationships balanced, which, in turn, helps him maintain a steady course in his career.\nIn our conversation with Pepe Dadon, we got a rare glimpse into the way his relationships shape and inspire his art. Whether it’s the emotional ups and downs he experiences with family, friends, or romantic partners, Pepe draws from every experience to fuel his music. But, perhaps more importantly, he maintains a strong sense of self—grounded in purpose and respect for those aroundhim.\nAs we await the release of “Inertia”, it’s clear that this project will not only reflect his musical evolution but also his personal growth. With each relationship, every trial, and every victory, Pepe Dadon is carving out his path in both life and music—on his own terms.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\n1.Where are you from and how would you describe your city?\nI’m from the nation’s capital. The place where the president stays and the government plays. It’s only one chocolate city just like it’s only one Von Dre.\n2. Who has been there for you the most as you’ve pursue your dreams of being an artist\nMy family has been my biggest cheerleaders on my journey as a musician. When I felt like giving up or thought no one would come to my shows, they were always there in the crowd, buying tickets, and supporting me. Without their love and encouragement, I might have given up and settled for a boring office job.\n3.At what age did you know you wanted to be an artist and how did you get started in the first place?\nI realized I wanted to be an artist when I was around 8 or 9 years old. It all started when I walked in on my older cousins rapping in their room. I loved listening to songs on the radio and knew all the lyrics by heart. My parents even joked that I should know my schoolwork as well as I knew those songs! I started writing my own raps and even freestyled against the security guard at my elementary school during lunch and recess. It became my therapy and I knew I wanted to make a career out of it.\n4.In your opinion who is the most influential and successful artist in your genre and why?\nWell, for me, it’s artists like Drake, Future, and Lil Wayne. They are like the OGs of the music scene, paving the way for others to follow. They have had a huge impact on the music industry and have made their lifestyle seem like the ultimate goal. These guys are like the kings of album sales, sold-out concerts, and making bank off their awesome tunes. They have been around for ages and still manage to stay on top of their game. It’s all about staying relevant and these three artists have definitely mastered that. Everything they do just turns to gold!\n5. What are your current thoughts on the music industry?\nI think the music industry is kind of in a weird spot. There’s a lot of drama and stuff going on, but we’re all just waiting for the next big artist to come along. It seems like things are changing and the old ways of doing things are fading away. Right now, it seems like women are really dominating the music scene, which is cool. But who knows, maybe someone like Von Dre will come along and shake things up again.\nIt’s all just a waiting game to see what happens next.\n6.How do you separate yourself from other artists?\nI set myself apart from other artists by being true to myself and expressing what I feel through my art. I don’t try to copy anyone else or follow trends – I just speak from the heart. My goal is to help others who may struggle to express themselves find a way to cope with life’s challenges. I also don’t stick to just one type of music or style because I see music as a journey. Life is like a highway, and I switch lanes and explore different routes until I find my destination. I’ve been on this musical journey for a while now, and I’m still discovering new things along the way.\n7. How do you stay motivated and continue your music as an artist?\nI stay motivated to keep making music because life inspires me. Every day, I learn new things and face different challenges, which gives me ideas for my songs. I know that other people might be going through similar stuff, so my music can help them too. As long as I’m alive and growing, I’ll always have the drive to create.\n8. What aspect of the music-making process excites you most and what aspect discourages you the most?\nRecording and creating music excited me the most. The only thing that discourages me is rolling out music and not reaching the proper audience or getting the attention that it deserves. As an indie artist the hardest part of being an independent is getting the project or the music to the masses.\n9. What was your inspiration behind your latest song “All on the line?”\nMy latest song was inspired by something that happened to me in my own life. It’s about trusting someone too much and being open to getting hurt in today’s world. I learned that sometimes the people you trust the most are the ones who end up hurting you. Now, I live my life with confidence and remember the feelings I had during that tough time as I move forward and grow.\n10.If you can describe your fans in one word what would it be and why?\nMy fans are Everything because they are the reason I am able to do what I love. They are genuine, dedicated, and truly understand the music. They feel the same emotions and experiences that I did when creating the songs they enjoy, and that connection is so special. I want to give a big shoutout to everyone who has watched my videos, listened to my songs, or come to see me perform live. Thank you all so much!\n11.Who would you like to work with in the future?\nIn the future, I really want to collaborate with some major artists like Brent Fyas, BigXThePlug, Future, Lil Wayne, and of course, Drake. It would be so cool to work with them and make some awesome music together!\n12.What advice would you give to upcoming artists who are trying to pursue their dreams?\nIf you’re trying to make your dreams come true, here’s some advice for you. Stay focused and keep working hard, no matter what. Even small steps forward count as progress. Remember, there will be good times and bad times, but the rewards will be worth it in the end. Ignore any negativity and learn how to handle challenges. Stay focused on your goals and protect your unique style at all costs. Keep pushing forward and never give up!\n13. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\nIn 5 years, I imagine myself as a big shot in the music industry. People will know me as Von Dre and my music will be heard everywhere. I want to make a real impact with my music and leave behind all the small gigs and tiny audiences. My goal is to reach the whole world with my music and perform for the masses.\n14. What Albums, latest releases or singles are available to your fans and where can they be found?\nSo, I put out two albums called “Misunderstood” and “4Ever YK” in the past year. I also released five singles like “Wifey,” “Dream Girl,” “Comfortable,” “Falling for You,” and “All Mines.” You can find all of my music on streaming platforms or wherever you listen to music. Just search for Von Dre – that’s two words, one name, and it’s in 3D so check your TV. Make sure to download and stream my music, treat yourself and don’t miss out!\n© 2025,C Wood.

It’s an unassuming, catchy joint that sets the mood for the project, while “morning coffee” follows up with a smooth, warm sound and intimate lyricism. Raymond brings an emotive feel and minimalism that is effective across a number of tracks on maim, such as the melancholic, personal “so over so done” and the rich instrumentation and patient pace of “left me behind”. “another praise” is a potent track that feels somewhat like the arc of the project, with a feeling of relief laced into glowing soul samples and heartfelt verses.\nMaim finds Boot Raymond dropping off a collection of varied, emotionally resonant songs that display engaging lyricism laced atop abstract production that draws from soul, jazz, gospel, and more.

They rose to fame after providing beats to various releases of the Diplomats. The bulk of albums like Diplomatic Immunity and Juelz Santana’s debut album, From Me to U, were produced by the Heatmakerz. The Heatmakerz thrived during the mid-’00s “chipmunk soul” era, and their sonic fingerprints can be found all over Dipset’s catalog. But it wasn’t long before they started taking their talents beyond the ‘Set to work with the likes of AZ, Lil Wayne, and Lil’ Flip. Their production style is based upon high-pitched soul samples. The Heatmakerz have accumulated over 25 million albums sold worldwide, working directly or influencing almost every artist in New York City.\nThe iconicproduction duo, The Heatmakerz, has decided to release an instrumental album today,January 10th, The Anti-Social Experiment, to share the classic New York sound with the world, released by FATBEATS.\nThe album is filled with vintage high-pitched soul samples curated by JNS, which made The Heatmakerz production distinct from other New York City producers in the past. On December 6th, the “Still Ready” instrumental was released, and several rappers, such as Crank Lucas and Connor Evans, made viral videos.\nThis album features a variety of production choices, from the low-pitched soul vocals in “Million Miles,” or the angelic vocals over the “Paradise” instrumental that’s reflective of the Wu-Tang “Time Is Money” instrumental, or to the emphatic opening track, “Where’s The Luv?,” filled with snares and horns.\nThe Heatmakerz are widely known for producing The Diplomats’ smash singles, “Dipset Anthem” and “I’m Ready.” Outside of The Diplomats, their other production credits include many legends such as Rick Ross, Ghostface Killah, Ludacris, Wayne, Jeezy, and more.

This collaboration is a testament to the duo’s ability to capture the struggles of inner-city life and the determination to overcome adversity. The track is more than just a song; it’s a narrative of survival, resilience, and unyielding ambition.\nFrom the moment the beat drops, “No Choice” immerses listeners in a brooding soundscape.

Reed Brixx enters the track with an emotional rawness, rapping about the hardships he’s faced and the sacrifices he’s made. His delivery is both urgent and reflective, perfectly complementing the weight of his lyrics. Lines like “Had to make a move, couldn’t sit and wait/ Every loss I took, I turned to fuel for the hate” showcase his unrelenting drive in the face of struggle.\nDeff Jawn’s verse adds a contrasting dynamic, bringing a streetwise swagger to the track.

The chemistry between the two artists is palpable, elevating the song’s emotional depth.\nThe hook is a standout element, with its repetitive chant of “No choice, no choice, had to make a way” serving as both a rally cry and a mantra. It’s a powerful reminder of the necessity to persevere when the odds are stacked against you. The relatability of the chorus ensures it will resonate with audiences far beyond the confines of hip-hop.\n“No Choice” is not just a showcase of lyrical prowess but also a reflection of the realities faced by many.

        "description": "\nAfter dropping the M.O.P. & Ruste Juxx assisted banger, “Run Em Up (Told Ya)” in April of last year, the Zimbabwe-born, London-based emcee, Rhyme Assassin let’s loose the track’s cinematic new visuals.\nShot in Brooklyn by Danny of Entity Studio, the video perfectly complements the high octane audio that pairs the burgeoning emcee with his Brooklyn rap royalty counterparts. The track also boasts production from underground rap luminary The Arcitype, whose menacing beat inspired Rhyme Assassin to reach out to his collaborators on here.“I could only hear M.O.P. on the instrumental,”he says, adding that it didn’t matter how many times he listened to it, because he could only hear the Brownsville bullies on the beat. Then, when he needed a third verse to close it out, he linked with Ruste, who“complemented M.O.P.’s energy and vibes,”Rhyme Assassin says.\n“Run Em Up” is the second single taken from Rhyme’s highly anticipated debut album,Dedicated to Self, a star-studded project featuring legends like Ras Kass, Masta Ace, Stic Man (dead prez), Saigon, and Keith Murray. Production on the album comes from a heavyweight lineup, including Buckwild, Tru Master, and DJ King Flow, promising a dynamic and hard-hitting soundscape.\nFans of raw lyricism and head-nodding beats can stream “Run Em Up (Told Ya)” — which is quick approaching 100k streams via Spotify —through all major digital retailers and streaming platforms. Keep an eye out forDedicated to Self, dropping later this year via Uncle Rhymez Records. And for newcomers, Rhyme Assassin’s past projects, likeSide Barz(2021), are a must-listen.\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nWhen people think of punk rock, they picture raw energy, rebellion, and a refusal to conform. Jordann Dwayne, Houston’s own genre-bending sensation, embodies all of that and more. With a fiery passion and a fearless approach to music, Dwayne has become a beacon for the modern punk rock movement—one that transcends tradition while staying rooted in its gritty essence.\nAt just 28, Dwayne has already hit major milestones. From landing on Apple Music’s Top 100 charts four times to becoming a Grammy voting member, his journey is proof that authenticity and hard work pay off. Now, with a new album on the horizon and a global tour set to ignite stages, he’s poised to make 2025 his breakout year.\nJordann’s upcoming album, Moments We Burned for Glory, isn’t just music—it’s a manifesto. Set for release in late January, the album captures the chaos, triumph, and heartache of his journey so far.\n“I didn’t want this to just be an album people listen to,” Jordann explains. “I wanted it to be something they feel. Every lyric, every riff—it’s all a piece of me.”\nEarly buzz suggests the album blends classic punk influences with modern production, creating a sound that’s nostalgic and cutting-edge all at once. From anthems for rebellion to introspective ballads, it’s shaping up to be his most dynamic work yet.\n\nIn true punk rock fashion, Jordann isn’t content to let his music speak for itself—he’s taking it directly to the fans. His 2025 world tour will see him electrify audiences across North America, the UK, and Germany. Known for his high-octane performances, Dwayne’s live shows are a visceral experience.\n“When I’m on stage, it’s like nothing else exists,” Jordann says. “It’s me, the music, and the crowd. There’s no filter, no holding back. Just pure energy.”\nTickets for the tour are already in high demand, and fans are eager to see the raw, unfiltered magic Jordann delivers on stage.\nWhile many artists focus solely on their music, Jordann has built an empire that extends far beyond the studio. His alternative fashion line, VYRIA Apparel, is redefining the punk aesthetic with bold, edgy designs that challenge mainstream fashion norms.\n“Punk rock isn’t just a sound; it’s a way of life,” Jordann says. “VYRIA is about giving people the tools to express that—to wear their rebellion with pride.”\nHis jewelry brand, Trilogy Diamond Co., showcases another side of his creativity. Known for its innovative designs and craftsmanship, the company has quickly become a favorite among trendsetters.\n“I wanted to create something timeless but daring,” he explains. “Jewelry that feels personal but also makes a statement.”\nDespite the offers pouring in from major labels and publishers, Jordann is staying true to his independent roots. For him, it’s not just about the spotlight—it’s about creating art that’s real and uncompromised.\n“I’ve always believed in doing things my way,” he says. “It’s not about chasing trends or pleasing everyone. It’s about staying true to who you are, even when it’s hard.”\nJordann Dwayne is more than a punk rock artist; he’s a force of nature. His music, fashion, and entrepreneurial ventures are all connected by a single thread: a deep commitment to authenticity. In a world that often rewards conformity, Jordann stands as a reminder that being yourself is the ultimate rebellion.\n“I’m not here to fit in,” Jordann says. “I’m here to stand out—and to make sure everyone else feels like they can do the same.”\nAs Moments We Burned for Glory drops and his world tour kicks off, there’s no doubt that Jordann Dwayne is paving the way for a new era of punk rock. Whether it’s through his music, his fashion, or his unapologetic attitude, he’s proving that rebellion is alive and well—and that its future looks brighter than ever.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "“Dangerous”: The Most Anticipated Rap Single of the Decade by George Gstar and NoCap",
        "description": "\n\nIn a world where hip hop continues to push boundaries, evolve, and influence cultural landscapes globally, few singles have managed to stir up as much anticipation as “Dangerous” by George Gstar and NoCap. Produced by the talented Al Geno, whose music has earned numerous accolades from the RIAA, his work stands out for its creativity and innovation. Al Geno has consistently pushed the boundaries of music production, earning recognition for his ability to blend genres and create unique soundscapes. His dedication to his craft has resulted in multiple awards and nominations, solidifying his reputation as a leading figure in the industry and has won several awards for his work with Young Bleu, NBA young boy and other major names like Rylo Rodriguez. With a keen ear for detail and a passion for storytelling through music, Al Geno continues to inspire both artists and fans alike. From Mobile, Alabama, “Dangerous” is not just another track—it’s shaping up to be a defining moment in the genre’s modern history.\nAdditionally, George Gstar’s audio engineer LoudPak, whose real name is Kyle Oueis, is making a name for himself in the industry as he has mixed and mastered some of the biggest hip hop tracks in recent years. George Gstar credits a significant part of his success in hip hop vocal training and songwriting to the incredible expertise and guidance of his audio engineer, Kyle Oueis. Known affectionately as ‘LoudPak,’ a nickname Gstar bestowed upon him during a night of creativity in the studio, Kyle has been instrumental in shaping Gstar’s sound and artistry. Gstar credits LoudPak with refining his vocal techniques and helping him develop a distinctive voice that resonates with audiences. Their collaborative synergy in the studio has been instrumental in shaping Gstar’s lyrical prowess and narrative artistry. Under LoudPak’s mentorship, Gstar’s songwriting has evolved to capture intricate emotions and storytelling depth, contributing significantly to the anticipation surrounding their latest single, “Dangerous.” This partnership highlights the crucial role of collaboration in the music industry, where shared creativity and knowledge can amplify an artist’s potential.\n\nA Collaboration Born in the Studio\nThe creative synergy between George Gstar and NoCap, whose real name is Kobe Vidal Crawford, is nothing short of electrifying. Both artists are known for their unique styles and innovative approach to hip hop, which has their fan bases eagerly awaiting their every move. Working alongside Al Geno, the trio has crafted a sound that is both fresh and deeply rooted in the authentic hip hop spirit. Their sessions, split between Los Angeles and Mobile, capture the essence of their artistic vision, blending raw street narratives with innovative beats that promise to resonate with fans worldwide.\nThe Backbone of Friendship and Guidance\nGeorge Gstar speaks highly of NoCap, not just as a fellow artist but as a lifelong friend whose support has been invaluable. Gstar accredits NoCap for providing powerful guidance and teaching him how to refine his rapping skills. During their time together, NoCap has been more than just a music collaborator; he’s been a mentor who genuinely cares about Gstar’s growth and success. As Gstar puts it, “I couldn’t have done it without the genuine love of Cap and his team.” This candid acknowledgment underscores the profound impact of their bond. It is this friendship, characterized by mutual respect and unwavering support, that has fueled their creative journeys and propelled Gstar to new heights in his career. Together, they demonstrate how authentic connections in the music industry can transform artistic potential into compelling realities.\nThe Art of Audio Engineering\nBehind every successful hip hop artist is a talented audio engineer, whose expertise in mixing and mastering can make or break a track. In the case of George Gstar, his partnership with LoudPak has been an integral part of his artistic development. LoudPak’s technical prowess and ability to bring out the best in Gstar’s vocal delivery have been essential to their collaborative success. As more artists turn to independent production and self-promotion, the role of audio engineers like LoudPak becomes even more crucial in shaping the landscape of hip hop.\nWaiting for the Right Rhythm: A Tactical Pause\nGeorge Gstar’s and his record label sponsors 8mm/10KPJ decision to temporarily hold back on releasing new music stems from the tumultuous political environment currently shadowing the United States. The instability has pierced through the cultural fabric, affecting not just artists but the essence of creative expression itself. Rap, which once thrived on its vibrant spirit and cultural dynamism, now feels a burdened echo of its exhilarating past. Amidst these challenging times, Gstar has chosen to focus his energy on his growing DarkWorld clothing line, a venture that allows for artistic exploration outside the strains of the music industry. He believes that the atmosphere must first return to one of positivity and potential for change for music to truly speak to the people once again. Waiting for music to return to a safe and fun creative space is essential in today’s climate, where the industry seems dominated by 16-year-old rappers and suburban hip hop. This shift reflects a political landscape that often prioritizes shock value over meaningful artistry. As we anticipate a revival of genuine expression, it’s crucial to foster an environment where all artists can thrive and share their true selves.\nExploring New Horizons: Fashion and Enlightenment\nWhile George Gstar waits for the right rhythm to return to music, he has embraced his passion for fashion design and writing, finding solace and peace in these creative endeavors. His love for fashion is evident in the growing success of his DarkWorld clothing line, which provides him a canvas for artistic expression outside the musical sphere. This venture not only fulfills his creative desires but also connects him with a broader audience who appreciates the fusion of style and substance. At the same time, Gstar is penning a book rooted in his spiritual beliefs, exploring themes of religion, enlightenment, and inner peace. Through writing, he discovers clarity of thought and a profound sense of self-awareness, allowing him to process the tumultuous world around him with a calm and clear mind. This period of introspection has been pivotal for Gstar, as it grants him the mental space needed to reflect on his journey and prepare for the future with renewed purpose. His story attests to the power of stepping back, embracing alternative forms of creativity, and nurturing the spirit in times of uncertainty.\nElevating Creative Potential\nThe collaboration between George Gstar and LoudPak is a testament to the power of shared creativity and knowledge in the music industry. By working together, they have been able to elevate each other’s potential, pushing the boundaries of their individual talents and creating something truly unique. This partnership also serves as a reminder that success in the music industry is not achieved alone, but through collaboration and support from those who share a common passion for creating great music.\nBMF Cash Kola and George Gstar: A Legacy of Family and Unity\nThe bond between George Gstar and BMF Music’s CashKola extends beyond music, encompassing a relationship that is as strong as family. This close-knit connection has been pivotal in nurturing Gstar’s confidence in his burgeoning music career. The mutual trust and support they share have had a profound impact on Gstar’s artistic journey, allowing him to explore deeper emotional themes in his work. George has often expressed this sentiment by stating, “I look at Cash as family and nothing less,” highlighting the profound respect and camaraderie that defines their relationship. CashKola, an accomplished artist himself under BMF Music, brings his own wealth of experience and creative flair to their collaborative efforts. His dual role as a mentor and collaborator has inspired Gstar to push boundaries and create music that truly resonates with listeners on an emotional level.\nFrom the very beginning of his musical journey, George Gstar has credited CashKola’s unwavering support, love, and guidance as the cornerstone of his success. Even when Gstar was learning the intricacies of rap, CashKola was a constant presence, offering invaluable advice and encouragement every step of the way. Without Cash’s timely interventions and nurturing, Gstar often reflects, his foray into music might have taken a vastly different turn. The genuine belief and faith Cash has shown in Gstar’s talents provided the grounding and motivation needed to persevere through challenges and stay true to his artistic calling. This relationship has been more than just a partnership; it is a testament to the power of teamwork and the profound impact of having someone deeply invested in your growth and achievement.\nGeorge Gstar fondly recalls an emotional moment that deepened his appreciation for CashKola, illustrating the strong personal bond they share. He recounts how he found himself alone in a hotel room in Atlanta on Father’s Day, a time traditionally spent with loved ones. Amid the solitude, he received a call from Cash, who selflessly altered his own plans to invite George to join him on a boating trip on the lake. “I was in Atlanta on a Father’s Day and I was in a hotel alone,” George reminisces, “and Cash called me and offered to include me and change around his plans just for me to come on a boat with him on the lake. It almost brought tears to my eyes.” For Gstar, this gesture solidified his view of Cash not just as a big brother but as a truly caring father figure and an exceptional individual. This heartfelt experience reinforces the depth of their relationship beyond mere professional collaboration. “I hold close the memories of those who truly care about me,” expresses Gstar.\nWaiting for the Right Time : The Unique Style of NoCap\nNoCap, an Alabama-born rapper, has been making waves in the hip hop scene with his distinctive melodic flow and introspective lyrics. His music reflects a sense of vulnerability that is rarely seen in mainstream rap, connecting with listeners on a deeply personal level. This unique style has earned him a loyal fan base that continues to grow with each project he releases. NoCap’s collaborations with Gstar and Al Geno have further elevated his music, blending his emotive verses with their production expertise to create truly powerful tracks. With hits like “Ghetto Angels” and “Demons,” NoCap has solidified himself as one of the most exciting young artists.\nThe Family Atmosphere Behind the Scenes\nThe family-like atmosphere fostered by George Gstar’s manager Chris Hamersley (Hammer) and NoCap’s manager Foreign has been pivotal in smoothing the path of their joint ventures. This supportive environment has not only nurtured the artists’ creativity but has also played a crucial role in easing negotiations with record labels. Hamersley and NoCap’s manager have diligently worked through the intricacies of the music industry, ensuring both Gstar and NoCap feel secure and valued in their professional dealings. Their hands-on approach and transparent communication have built a network of trust and camaraderie that allows the artists to focus on their craft. This strong managerial foundation has been instrumental in overcoming potential hurdles, ultimately ensuring that the music resonates with authenticity and passion.\nChris Hamersley: A Decade of Trust and Friendship\nChris Hamersley, known affectionately as “Hammer,” has been more than just a manager to George Gstar; he has been a steadfast friend and trusted confidant for nearly a decade. Their relationship transcends the business realm, firmly rooted in a deep mutual respect and loyalty akin to brotherhood. George often credits Hammer’s unwavering support for guiding him through both personal trials and professional milestones. Hammer’s keen understanding of the music industry and attentive approach have been invaluable, allowing George to navigate the complexities of his career with confidence and peace of mind. His dedication to George’s well-being, both artistically and personally, is a testament to the genuine bond they share, making Hammer an indispensable figure in George’s life and success.\nRico Evander III: The Visionary Catalyst Behind Gstar’s Evolution\nRE3, known as ‘Rico Evander’, is one of George Gstar’s music managers and has been instrumental in both nurturing Gstar’s career and fostering a deep, lifelong friendship. With unwavering dedication and support, Rico has skillfully guided Gstar through the intricacies of the music industry, always prioritizing his personal and professional growth. This relationship transcends conventional artist-manager dynamics, as Gstar frequently articulates his appreciation for Rico, regarding him as both a brother and a friend. Rico’s genuine belief in Gstar’s talent and vision has provided a strong foundation for Gstar’s success. The mutual respect and camaraderie they share have created an environment conducive to creativity and loyalty. Rico’s influence is evident not only in the strategic decisions that have elevated Gstar’s career but also in the heartfelt connection that strengthens Gstar’s journey, rendering each achievement a shared success.\nPart of the Anticipated “Darkworld” Album\n“Dangerous” isn’t just a standalone single; it’s a part of the highly anticipated album “Darkworld.” This project is set to feature a roster of big celebrity rappers, some of which are yet to be disclosed, making it a highly coveted release. With its mix of seasoned talent and musical innovation, “Darkworld” aims to redefine the current hip hop soundscape, challenging norms and setting new trends.\nThe Concept Behind “Darkworld”\n“Darkworld” represents a bold and ambitious exploration into themes often considered untouchable or unconventional in mainstream music. The album plunges into a narrative of apocalyptic candor, where the end of times sets the stage for a limitless creative expression. In this conceptual realm, the boundaries of reality and artistry blur, providing an unfettered creative space where anything goes. Gstar and collaborators delve into raw, unfiltered emotions and experiences, crafting a soundscape that embodies chaos and resilience. The project challenges listeners to confront their perceptions of normalcy and push the limits of imagination, inviting them into a musical universe where possibilities are as infinite as the darkness it portrays. “Darkworld” isn’t just an album; it’s an audacious artistic statement, capturing the essence of a world uninhibited by convention.\nDiscover the Mysteries of the Dark World Collection\nWhile the “Darkworld” album promises to revolutionize the music scene, fans can first look forward to the runway fashion collection from George Gstar, aptly named “Darkworld.” This exclusive line is inspired by sophisticated longline designs from Europe and the elegance of Chanel runway shows, offering a fusion of avant-garde fashion with contemporary flair. Proceeds from the collection will graciously support charity initiatives, reflecting Gstar’s commitment to giving back to the community. The music from the “Darkworld” album will follow the fashion release, thereby creating a comprehensive artistic experience that blends high-fashion with groundbreaking music, all while benefiting a great cause.\nDespite the immense excitement surrounding “Dangerous,” George Gstar and NoCap have chosen to delay its release. The decision stems from their desire to launch the single in a climate where hip hop can thrive without external pressures. Both artists feel that the current state of the United States, with its economic challenges and the industry’s ongoing struggles, has made it less conducive for genuine artistic expression.\nTheir sentiment reflects a broader frustration within the hip hop community. Many artists feel targeted and misunderstood, with the genre often being scapegoated for societal issues. George Gstar and NoCap are waiting for a time when the industry is less political and more about the music—a time when the culture can be celebrated for its creativity and artistry.\nThe Magic of Teamwork\nThe magic behind “Dangerous” lies not only in its beats and lyrics but also in the teamwork that has brought it to life.

        "description": "\n\nEmerging artist Kofi Santana has unveiled his latest hit single, “Pissed Me Off” (TxnaTalk 2). The release comes in the wake of a personal tragedy; his brother passed away on June 1, 2017, a day they had planned to meet. Unfortunately, Kofi was unable to do so due to summer school commitments and received the heartbreaking news shortly thereafter. He expressed, “It’s essential for my auntie and my children that I pursue this now, as there is no one else left. I must honor my promise to my brother before I depart and ensure my children are secure for generations to come.”\nIn 2019, Kofi faced legal troubles in South Korea, where he was arrested for grand larceny and faced a potential ten-year sentence. He managed to settle the case for $5,000, resulting in the dismissal of all charges, but was subsequently discharged from the army six months later. Upon returning home, he experienced personal upheaval as his wife, Cordai, filed for divorce, leading him to drift into the streets and step away from music for six years. Now, Kofi has made a triumphant return. His latest single “Pissed Me Off” (TxnaTalk 2) is available on all streaming platforms.

Their chemistry shines through, bringing depth and mutual respect to a standout track that underscores their place as two of the most vital voices in contemporary UK music.\nFor fans of Central Cee’s more melodic side, “Now We’re Strangers” (featuring the vocals of Kamal., who also featured on Central Cee and Dave’s collaborative tapeSplit Decision),and “Truth in the Lies” (feat. Lil Durk) delve into the emotional complexities of love, heartbreak, and trust. “Now We’re Strangers” leans into especially personal territory, with a rare lyrical glimpse into Cee’s private life. This is Central Cee at his most vulnerable, using music as a vehicle for raw storytelling and catharsis.\nCentral Cee’s debut albumCan’t Rush Greatnessserves to reinforce his position as a boundary-pushing force across the globe.\n\n\n© 2025,Seth \"Digital Crates\" Barmash.

        "title": "ANTANIA, a Bass project is breaking into the Industrial Metal world with a sound called ‘Doom Bass’",
        "description": "\nThere is something compelling about music that will make people jump into a vehicle and travel the length and breadth of their own country and, if they are lucky, play their music to a packed venue or the classic cliche of one man and his dog. Yet a bass music project is breaking into the metal and Industrial world like no other. This duo is sadistic, terrifying and utterly original. Antania is blurring the lines between bass music and blackened metal.\nThe flip side to that is that fans of music will also readily do the same and having racked up thousands of miles in my lifetime traveling to see bands great and small in some of the most prestigious concerts halls and some of the most pitiful, so when I was told that Dr Luna was going to be making the 2,091 mile trip from Joshua Tree CA  to bring his Antania project to Milwaukee WI for three live dates (including Chicago) the 5 hour car journey from Detroit seemed a paltry undertaking in comparison. The first half of the trek passed in a blur of beautiful countryside and sunshine, high tempo catchy music on the stereo, distracting the key to stop me talking out loud to myself. The second half of my journey, in preparation for the evening I threw on Antania’s  recent album ‘The God Complex”  and followed this up with previous effort ‘Lividity” (only on bandcamp), one thing I have to say is that as much as I love it, for me, Doom Bass is not the best driving material. I can get lost in the constant, repetitive bass lines and forget where I am at. I love bass music and I love seeing a bass music project blowing apart the industrial Metal scene, and for good reason. This is bass music’s only real chance to appeal to a blackened metal audience. It’s working!\nAs the skies darkened and threatened rain, the oppressively atmospheric mechanised music can give the mind too much time to wonder, becoming acutely aware of my own dependence on technology at that moment; the purring of the engine, the contours and textures of the road and the sheer wonderment at what abominations people will do to perfectly good cars in the name of ‘style’. Either that or this was the point I remembered just how fucking boring motorway driving is!\n\nNever-the-less the change in atmosphere was palpable as I left Detroit behind and headed towards a city that was famous for  industrial mills, football and beer, in turn leading us to the towering slabs of Doom laced Metal that Antania owe a debt, carving out sounds that are the bastard offspring of Black Sabbath and the machines that gave them both inspiration.\nThe main room where the bands are is tight, warm and claustrophobic, offering a contrast to the peaceful fundraiser going on for the Anti-Hunting Brigade out in the beer garden. From the art galleries of Paris to squats in Germany,Dr Lunahas taken his brand of frightening biomechanical Doom Bass across Europe already, earlier 2024.\nAs someone who has helped set up their fair share of gigs, just watching the set up was an event, no heads and cabs wheeled into place, no drum breakables being assembled; instead what looks like a futuristic gun on a caterpillar track and an array of knobs and wires that look more like a power station control centre rather than the prelude to a musical performance.\n\nThe anticipation in the room was palpable as Kali Mortem took to the stage behind the veil and wrapped her fingers round the sure microphone with the number 8 ablaze, teasing the crowd and asking for more volume from the sound guy and then; Boom. Or rather Doom.\nThe sounds that are created are WAY more vertigo inducing in a live setting as they are on record, a mind bending warp of The Prodigy and Slayer colliding with Godflesh and Ministry in a decaying factory, kicking the shit out of each other as the building comes crashing down around them.\nMelding aspects of their two releases together, it is possible to pick out moments like ‘In the Fire” and ‘The God Complex” from the previous album mixed in with squealing electronic freak outs and rib crushing bass; all the while the nature of the way the music is crafted means that the performance from Antania is visually captivating and physically demanding as he pounds the bass hammer on the front of his facade like Actuator and slides and twists the other sound manipulating devices and Kali Mortem has a voice that sounds like your being ripped apart.\nVideo: The God Complexhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGdfgmVw-gE&pp=sAQB\nMore dark and brutal than on record it is no less an entertaining show and with a pumped up crowd which contrasted with the oppressive, claustrophobic, pulsing sounds, the robotic duo conjured the air of Philip K Dick and a thousand other science fiction writers’ worst nightmares. Even a brief hiatus due to some technical problems arising from a less than sturdy playing surface couldn’t dampen the mood and the audience were left baying for more even after the last bruting bass drop disappeared.\nIt seems the wider world is finally waking up to the genius of Antania and to see the show up close and personal in a tiny, sweaty, packed room was a treat and something that may never be replicated. Quite unlike anything you have heard or seen, it was well worth the 10 hour round trip.\n\nCatch Antania live as direct support for Psyclon Nine and Ventana\n💀Antania Live💀\n1-31 San Diego, CA\n2-2 Portland, OR\n2-3 Seattle, WA\n2-5 Lincoln, NE\n2-7 Detroit, MI\n2-8 Toronto, ON\n2-19 Tampa, FL\n2-20 Orlando, FL\n2-22 Austin, TX\n2-23 Dallas, TX\n2-25 Denver, CO\n2-28 Mesa, AZ\n3-1 Las Vegas, NV\n3-8 Los Angeles, CA\nWww.instagram.com/antaniaofficial\nWww.linktree.com/antaniaofficial\nPics by Ricrdo Herrera\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "Smooth R&B Artist Reggie Braxton Covers Erykah Badu’s “Next Lifetime” with Motown Inspired Brax-Tone Style",
        "description": "\n\nDetroit, MI – When you hail from the Motor City with a grandmother who sang the blues, and a cousin who was one of the original Motown Temptations, music just kind of rests in your spirit and organically becomes who you are. Pianist, singer, songwriter and producer, Reggie Braxton has aptly honed such impactful melodious roots into his Brax-Tone Records debut release, “The Brax-Tone Experience,” a luxurious jazz infused, heart caressing collection of original and timeless R&B singles.\nHisfirstrelease, a velvety cover of Erykah Badu’s “Next Lifetime,” is our invitation to a project simmering with warmth and seduction. “The Brax-Tone Experience” is the ambiance of low lights, flickering candles and chilled libations with Braxton perfectly poised to make his “Brax-Tone” the only tone for romance! Production credits boast none other than Detroit’s own silky, smooth serenader, J. Poww of UNV fame, alongside the Grammy nominated Chris “Buddaflywolf” Bivens, producer for Chris Brown, Tank and Kehlani, with engineering by another Detroit legend, the Grammy Award-winning Jezreel Santos, whose projects include soulful crooners Kem, Gregory Porter and Mali Music.\nWith Detroit heralded as the origin of some of the greatest love songs ever written, Braxton doesn’t disappoint, paying respectful tribute to his hometown legacy. “The Brax-Tone Experience” is a fully immersive soundscape of passion and desire.  From unforgettable covers like Michael Franks’ “Lady Wants to Know” and Toto’s “Georgy Porgy” to original compositions like “Just Like You,” and “I Pray It’s You,” Braxton is serious about listeners surrendering to his melodic swag. “I Pray It’s You” is currently charting on the Billboard Jazz chart and his single “Love Guarantee” peaked at 39 on the MediaBase music charts.\n“’The Brax-Tone Experience’ is my unique rendition of blending R&B and jazz. J. Poww’s production effort, combined with the overlay of his background vocals create what I believe is a signature sound. I want my song interpretations and the stories I tell to be well received reflections of my musical heritage,” offers Braxton.\nBraxton’s enamored offerings come from a backdrop dipped deep with home brewed fervor. His grandmother, Gladys English, was a blues singer who surrounded him with harmony and narratives that laid the initial foundation for his musical aspirations. His cousin, famed bass singer, Melvin Franklin, from Motown’s legendary group, The Temptations, also inspired Braxton with confidence early on.\n“I’ve been dedicated to nurturing the Brax-Tone aesthetic since my youth. Being raised in Detroit and having a cousin in the Temptations was major for me.  Melvin’s distinctive bass stylings made me feel better about my own voice.  First and second tenors typically were the norm, getting all the attention and recognition, but Melvin showed me how to excel by stepping outside the lines.  I have a baritone range with some falsetto capabilities, but because of my cousin, I learned to become comfortable and accepting of my own distinct gifts,” expresses Braxton.\nReggie Braxton’s village included piano greats Ben Jones and the late Dr. Teddy Harris, as well as sax men Bobby Barnes and Miller Brisker. He made his foray into performing on the local jazz scene with the late great Detroit guitarist Calvin Brooks.  He has sharpened his skills alongside a notable sprinkling of Detroit icons, including Allan Barnes, Ray McKinney, Eileen Orr, Grayland McKinney of Straight Ahead, and the Grammy-nominated Brandon Williams.  With influences that include Luther Vandross, Dionne Warwick, Michael Franks, Sarah Vaughn, Frank Sinatra, Scotty and Walter from The Whispers and Nat King Cole, Braxton adds his “Brax-Tone Experience” to a long catalog of classics.\n“Here in Detroit, we are music critics by nature. Our history laid the foundation for R&B. With innumerable compositions that still stand the test of time, we take a special pride in bringing our A-game to the table. ‘The Brax-Tone Experience’ is a homage to my birthright, and the “Brax-Tone” will hopefully cement my own artistic vibe that music lovers will appreciate for years to come!”\nDim the lights and pour the wine as you listen to “The Brax-Tone Experience” on your favorite streaming platform.

        "description": "\n\nKun The Highbinder is a Korea born U.S. based artist. He had a lot of influences of Kpop growing up, however, he moved to the U.S. due to his family’s properties getting taken away by the government when he was 11. He got kicked out of the house at a young age of 13 due to his violent ways.\nKun The Highbinder was interested in making beats at first, but then he realized these rappers are mediocre and started rapping by himself at the age of 17, but didn’t take music seriously. However, after 3 years in America it changed his whole point of view of the world.\nHe was getting into Florida hip hop, Chicago drill, and West Coast Hip Hop. He made beats for about 3 to 4 years and rapped seriously for about 1 and a half years during his house arrest for his robbery case, and his Grand Theft Auto case. The artist was getting schizophrenic due to the absurd amount of drug use. Currently, he is living in a Felony Incompetent to stand trial program with 62 other members, getting along and focusing on making music everyday.\nAfter his time is over from the program, his records will be clean and he’ll be a innocent citizen who just had mental illness for a bit. The song “Valentine” was started off with a beat, as soon as Kun The Highbinder heard it he had ideas popping up in his head. He says, “I was writing a couple of love songs at the moment so I got the idea where I say “I’ve been writing about you”. I recalled the feelings of my past love when I first started crushing on somebody and the actions of pulling and pushing the strings of love between one another.” He adds, the verse where I say “aint no where to go, but my heart is at the door, step out, step out, let’s get this out, lets let it out” meaning “let me help you escape from the reality and step in to a new world that is waiting for you”.\n“Help Me Fly” means to be my wings for me and fly with me to the top together. The artist describes how the love would be like with him and wanting to know if the feelings are mutual. The ultimate meaning behind this song is don’t hesitate to show your lover how you feel and cherish every last bit of the love when you can.\nCheck out “Valentine” (Help Me Fly) out now on all streaming platforms and be sure to follow Kun The Highbinder on social media for his latest releases.\nConnect:\nApple Music:https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kun-the-highbinder/1691130825\nYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL8e_2DhgJY\nInstagram: @kun_the_highbinderhttps://www.instagram.com/kun_the_highbinder/\nX: @itshighbinderhttps://x.com/itshighbinder\nFacebook: Kun The Highbinderhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61571817650599\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

This emcee has proven time and time again that he can hold his own with the best in the game. Inspired by none other than the God MC himself, Rakim, Jsun Borne has spent years honing his craft, determined to reshape the Chicago rap scene and leave his mark on the culture.\nFrom Darcsyde to a Solo Legacy\nJsun Borne first gained recognition as part of the legendary Chicago rap group Darcsyde, a collective that stormed the underground scene with raw lyricism and an unfiltered approach to hip-hop.

His latest single, *Whiskey Eyes*, takes listeners on an emotional journey through the highs and lows of life, all while enjoying a drink of whiskey. The track’s reflective nature, combined with its melodic rhythms, makes it a standout release in DjMostHigh’s growing catalog.\nWhiskey Eyes is more than just a song about drinking—it’s a meditation on life, growth, and the power of reflection. In the song, DjMostHigh invites listeners to take a moment to slow down, pour a glass of whiskey, and look back on the moments that shape us. The lyrics are poetic, exploring the idea that every sip of whiskey brings clarity, urging one to pause and reflect on the path they’ve walked.\nThe single features a combination of mellow beats, atmospheric soundscapes, and a steady rhythm that complements the somber yet hopeful mood of the song.\nDjMostHigh’s mastery over production shines through, creating a sonic experience that mirrors the introspective nature of the lyrics. It’s a track that’s perfect for those late nights when you want to think about where you’ve been and where you’re headed.\nWhile the concept of drinking whiskey has often been associated with celebration, DjMostHigh flips this narrative on its head, focusing instead on the reflective side of sipping spirits. Each verse delves into themes of solitude, self-awareness, and the weight of past choices. It’s a song that encourages taking a step back from the hustle and bustle of life, allowing oneself to slow down, even if just for a moment.\nThe imagery in the lyrics is vivid and poignant, with whiskey serving as both a metaphor and a companion in the process of self-reflection. It’s about being present in the moment, processing one’s thoughts, and finding peace in the quietude of life’s complexities. The track speaks to those who appreciate the bittersweet moments, where contemplation and connection are found in the simplest of rituals.\nSo, pour yourself a glass, put on Whiskey Eyes, and reflect on life’s winding path— one sip at a time.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

With influences spanning multiple cultures, Rhyme Assassin has positioned himself as an artist who can bridge the gap between Africa, Europe, and the United States.\nThe name “Rhyme Assassin” is a deliberate choice, combining the poetic essence of “rhyme” with the precision and execution of an “assassin.” This name reflects his approach to hip-hop—sharp, calculated, and impactful. His music is designed to connect deeply with listeners, tackling topics that resonate across borders.\nRhyme Assassin’s target market is broad—anyone who appreciates authentic, conscious music with a message.

His music is informed by a deep understanding of different cultures, allowing him to create content that resonates on multiple levels. His goal is to unite audiences across continents through a shared appreciation of authentic hip-hop.\nA firm believer in resilience and ambition, Rhyme Assassin lives by the motto:Never downgrade your dreams/goals to match your current reality but upgrade your conviction to reach your destiny.His influences reflect his love for boom-bap hip-hop, with legends like KRS-One, Rakim, 2Pac, Wu-Tang Clan, and EPMD shaping his sound.

        "title": "Gianluca Zanna Releases Captivating New Single “You Are My Destiny”",
        "description": "\n\nHailing from Rome and spending his formative years in Anzio, Gianluca’s journey was influenced by personal hardships. The impact of his parents’ divorce and his father’s aggressive behavior towards his mother led him to seek solace in solitude and the natural world. At the tender age of 10, he would find himself atop his grandfather Bruno’s apartment in Anzio, feeling the salty breeze of the Tirreno Sea while penning his first poems. Although he had yet to master the English language, he envisioned crossing oceans, overcoming cultural divides, and establishing himself as a songwriter in America.\nGianluca’s passion for music emerged early in his life. Motivated by rock bands, he began learning English and composing songs, despite having only a rudimentary guitar—a broom handle with two strings. His enthusiasm was nurtured by the melodies of his grandfather and the film scores from his family’s theater, laying the groundwork for a lifelong commitment to music.\nAt the age of 11, Gianluca enrolled in the Italian National Boarding School Convitto Nazionale. Despite its strict environment, he found comfort in music, discovering neglected instruments in the attic—a guitar, a bass, and a drum—and teaching himself to play. By 16, he became a member of the prestigious Military Academy Nunziatella, an experience that reinforced his rebellious nature and intensified his quest for freedom.\nAt 19, Gianluca embarked on an extraordinary global journey in pursuit of love and self-discovery. Armed with only his determination and devoid of a phone or credit card, he explored the Canary Islands, French Polynesia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Singapore, and various European nations. Ultimately, at the age of 30, his aspiration came to fruition—he legally immigrated to America, the land where his new chapter would begin.\nGianluca Zannawas already making significant strides in the music industry prior to his relocation to the United States. He emerged as one of Italy’s youngest music publishers by founding Contatto Discografico, a prominent music business magazine. His contributions also include the publication of influential music literature, such as the Vocal Method of Elizabeth Sabine, a guide authored by the esteemed vocal coach known for training Hollywood rockstars like Megadeth and Axl Rose. Furthermore, he established himself as a music producer and manager, acquiring prestigious domain names in the sound effects sector, includingwww.soundeffects.comandwww.soundfx.com.\nCurrently, Gianluca Zanna is the driving force behind Zanna Records, a label that brings his musical visions to fruition. With a repertoire of over 120 original songs, his work exemplifies the realization of dreams, the translation of emotions into melodies, and an indomitable spirit that defies limitations.\nIn addition to his musical endeavors, Gianluca has excelled in self-defense, attaining the status of a Krav-Maga Military and Firearms Instructor, as well as an expert in executive protection. His journey—marked by global experiences, challenges, and triumphs—demonstrates that dreams pursued with steadfast determination can lead to an extraordinary life.\nThe narrative of Gianluca Zanna is far from complete. With each note, lyric, and progressive step, his symphony unfolds—a powerful reminder of the impact of passion, resilience, and the conviction that no aspiration is too grand to pursue.\nGianluca Zanna’s most recent release, “You Are My Destiny,” draws inspiration from a dream he experienced during his teenage years while residing in a boarding school in Italy. In this dream, he envisioned a future in America as a songwriter. The dream featured a woman who communicated with Gianluca, promising to find him when he grew up. Today, that woman is the love of his life and sings the song.\nCheck out “You Are My Destiny” out now on all streaming platforms as well as Gianluca’s new comic book “The Adventures of Mr Zanna: The Beginning”, available now onAmazon.

        "description": "\nIn the ever-evolving world of online gaming, one particular game has captured the hearts and minds of Filipinos everywhere. EnterTongitsGo, the digital sensation that’s reimagining a classic Filipino card game for the modern era. But what makes this game so special, and why is everyone talking about it? Let’s dive in and explore the phenomenon that isTongitsGo!\nWhat’sTongitsGo All About?\nAt its core,TongitsGo is an online version ofTongits, a traditional Filipino card game that’s been enjoyed for generations. Think of it as a local twist on Rummy, but with its own unique flavors and strategies. The goal is simple: be the first player to get rid of all your cards. But don’t let that fool you – beneath this straightforward objective lies a world of strategy, skill, and excitement.\nInTongitsGo, players typically start with 12 cards each, while the dealer gets 13. The remaining cards form a draw pile in the center. Players take turns drawing cards, either from the draw pile or from the discard pile, aiming to create “melds” – sets or sequences of cards. The first player to empty their hand wins the game!\nBut here’s where it gets interesting:TongitsGoisn’t just about getting rid of your cards. It’s about reading your opponents, making smart decisions, and sometimes taking calculated risks. It’s a game that keeps you on your toes and challenges you to think several moves ahead.\nWhy is Everyone Hooked onTongitsGo?\n1. Accessibility at Your Fingertips\nOne of the biggest draws ofTongitsGo is its accessibility. Gone are the days when you needed to gather friends physically to enjoy a game ofTongits. WithTongitsGo, all you need is a smartphone and an internet connection.\n2.

A Mental Workout\nWhileTongitsGo is undoubtedly fun, it’s also a great way to keep your mind sharp. The game requires strategic thinking, memory skills, and quick decision-making. As you play, you’re constantly analyzing your hand, predicting your opponents’ moves, and adapting your strategy. It’s like a gym workout for your brain!\n4. Exciting Tournaments and Prizes\nFor those with a competitive streak,TongitsGo offers regular tournaments with exciting prizes. These events add an extra layer of excitement to the game, giving players achance to test their skills against the best and potentially win big.

By bringing this classic card game into the digital realm, it ensures that younger generations can continue to enjoy and appreciate this piece of Filipino heritage.\nBecome aTongitsGo Champion!\nWant to up your game and dominate theTongitsGo scene? Here are some pro tips to help you on your way to becoming aTongitsGo master:\nWatch Your Cards Like a Hawk\nGood card management is crucial inTongitsGo. Always be aware of what’s in your hand and what possibilities it holds. Look for potential melds early in the game and try to build on them. Don’t be afraid to discard high-value cards if they don’t fit into your strategy – sometimes, letting go is the key to victory.\nRead Your Opponents Like a Book\nTongitsGo isn’t just about your own cards – it’s about understanding what your opponents are up to. Pay attention to which cards they’re picking up and discarding. Are they drawing from the pile frequently? They might be struggling to form melds. Is someone discarding high-value cards? They could be close to winning. The more you can deduce about your opponents’ hands, the better you can plan your own moves.\nBluff Like a Pro\nSometimes, the key to winning isn’t in the cards you hold, but in making youropponentsthink you have a different hand. Discarding high-value cards early can make others think you’re close to winning, even if you’re not. This might cause them to make hasty decisions or discard cards that could help you. But be careful – use this strategy sparingly, or your opponents might catch on!\nMaster the “Sapaw“\nThe “Sapaw” move is unique toTongitsand adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. It involves adding a card to an existing meld on the table, whether it’s yours or anopponent’s. Mastering when and how to use “Sapaw” can give you a significant advantage. Use it to disrupt your opponents’ plans, protect your own melds, or create new opportunities for yourself.\nKnow When to Hold ‘Em, Know When to Fold ‘Em\nSometimes, the best move inTongitsGo is to cut your losses. If you find yourself with a particularly bad hand, it might be better to fold early and minimize your point loss rather than struggling on and potentially losing big. Learning when to take this option is a crucial skill that separates the good players from the great ones.\nJoin theTongitsGo Revolution!\nTongitsGo isn’t just a passing fad – it’s a digital revolution that’s breathing new life into a beloved Filipino tradition. It’s a game that challenges your mind, connects you with others, and keeps you coming back for more.

The message and vocals are impactful along with powerful production by Pro-Logic.\nThe album begins with the title track which is also produced by Pro-Logic. It features Mystic Seed and Imani. The music and the vocals are infectious. The spoken word throughout the track helps to add depth to the song. Overall it’s a great message.\nThe next song I listened to was “Sleepy People” produced by J6. On this track Wasun gets personal and speaks about his brush with death. The sample based hook is catchy. I had this track on repeat.\n“Every Cook Can Govern” is political. It’s about a revolution where the working class overthrow the elite. I enjoyed this Pro-Logic produced track.\n“Always” and “Amina from Weston” are songs about his daughter. Both are heartfelt tracks. “Always” produced by Pro-Logic and “Amina from Weston” produced by Beats McFinnigan While the sample based chorus for “Always” stays in your head the guest appearance by Norman “Otis” Richmond on “Amina from Weston” helps bring this song to life.\n“Write Letters” is uplifting and makes you want to contact relatives you haven’t been in touch with for a while. “Write Letters” is produced by Pro-Logic.\nThe album ends with “What I Live” which pays homage to Krs One. Not only did I enjoy the vocals/lyrics/delivery on this track and of course the production by Pro-Logic. The cuts and scratches on this track are on point as well.\nWasun, Pro-Logic, J6 and Beats McFinnigan work well together.

        "title": "Da Geechie Poet  – “Between the World and Me”",
        "description": "\nWords by Tony Thompson\nIt all started with his first taste of puppy love and adolescent heartbreak in the ninth grade. His first pretty, little girlfriend had broken his tiny heart, so the Charleston, S.C. native aptly called Da Geechie Poet took to paper and pen to release his emotions.\nSitting in study hall penciling his heartfelt prose, a close friend who was seated next to him read over the paper and encouraged him to continue to cultivate his craft.\nGeechie didn’t think much of it at the time, but he would often use his every free moment to write stanza after stanza about the world around him, his feelings and his experiences. After noticing how he excelled in English, added to the fact that both his grandmother and best friend were adamant about him publishing his poetry, becoming an author didn’t seem like such a bad idea.\n“After having a number of composition notebooks filled with so much potential, I told myself it was time,” the 31-year-old Geechie reveals.\nThat time didn’t come until after high school graduation when he was enrolled in college at Trident Technical College. Financial aid was giving him the run-around about his tuition, saying that his parents earned too much money for him to qualify for the state lottery financial assistance. And in order for him to continue his education, he would have to come out of pocket for school.\n“If I’mma pay to go to school, I might as well do just the things that I was going to school to do,” he explains. “The professor would be talking in class. I’m supposed to be taking notes, but I’m writing rhymes.”\nWith this dilemma in front of him, the young scholar came to a crossroads in his life. “I came to the conclusion that I either give these people my money and take these math classes and these English classes for something the I’m trying to strive for,” he reveals, “or I can just put it all on the lines and get the book published. And that’s what I did.”\nHe adopted the pseudonym Da Geechie Poet as a reflection of his Gullah Geechee heritage, which is derived from descendants of enslaved West and Central Africans in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.\nThe Gullah people and their creole dialect of English are called Geechee, and their culture has preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural customs from their crafts, farming and fishing to folk beliefs, music, cuisine and story-telling traditions which trace their lineage to Central and West African cultures.\n“If you hear me another Geechee talking, you probably wouldn’t understand what we were saying,” he points out.\nBorn in the historic city of Charleston, the largest slave port in the United States at one time, and raised in the West Ashley section of town, Da Geechie Poet came up full of pride of his family legacy. And he knew that if he became a published author, his culture had to be on the forefront of anything he would do.\nAnd although he had his plan well put together and systemically thought out, execution was a beast all on its own. At the time, getting books published on Amazon wasn’t possible, so Geechie started calling several publishers to distribute his book.\nEach company he called told him to send them his entire manuscript, and they would quote him a price for their services. “Several companies told me this, and I was like ‘Nah, I can’t do that,’” he contends.\nContinuing his search for a distributor, he stumbled on Xlibris Publishing and released his first book through the company in 2013. His book was available in Barnes & Nobles, Books A Million and on e-book.\nSince then, he has published poetry books Carolina Bird: Geechie Boy in 2015 and Erotic Flight in 2020. Carolina Bird contains urban-styled poetry with worldly views, love themes and various encounters of life. Erotic Flight has more mature themes for adults only.\nTo his influences, he credits the likes of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Maya Angelou, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Edgar Allan Poe and Tupac Shakur, to whom he acknowledges as being a catalyst for his true-to-life subject matter like the time he and his friends were harassed by the cops simply for being black.\n“Tupac had a very big influence on me to write and not be a rapper,” he reveals. “There’s nothing wrong with being a rapper, but what I do is very, very different.”\nConnect:\nInstagram: Geechie Poet\nYouTube: Geechie Poet\nFacebook: Geechie Poet\nX: Geechie Poet\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\nIn the heart of a gritty urban neighborhood known as Brick Yard, where dreams are often overshadowed by violence and despair, a young man named Lingo—affectionately dubbed SpraySpray by his family and friends—struggles to break free from a cycle of poverty and crime. At the tender age of 12, desperation leads him down a dark path, and by 15, he finds himself facing the harsh realities of incarceration after being arrested for drug dealing. As fate takes a cruel turn, Lingo endures a harrowing life marked by violence; a shooting incident and a close brush with death leave deep scars and heavy burdens on his heart. Having lost too many loved ones to gun violence, he teeters on the edge of despair, caught between the influences of his tumultuous surroundings and a yearning for a brighter future. When falsely accused of murder, Lingo’s fight for survival reaches a pivotal moment.\n\nDeclared not guilty due to self-defense, he enters the prison system facing the looming specter of the death penalty. But within those prison walls, in a place where hope can easily wither, Lingo discovers something profound: the power of education and self-reflection. With unwavering determination, he spends his time transforming himself, ultimately earning a college degree that ignites a newfound purpose. After ten long years, he emerges from prison, not as the troubled youth he once was, but as a compassionate soul, ready to heal others. Using his own experiences as a catalyst for change, Lingo retrains his life’s trajectory and becomes a therapist, dedicated to helping those trapped in cycles similar to his own. “Beyond the Brick Yard” is a powerful, poignant tale inspired by a true story, celebrating the resilience of the human spirit. It’s a journey of redemption, healing, and the unwavering belief that it’s never too late to change your narrative. Join Lingo as he navigates the complexities of life, using his past as a beacon of hope for others seeking to escape the shadows of their own Brick Yard.\n\n\nInstagram: @Jamelweeksesq\nFacebook: Jamel Weeks\n© 2025,C Wood.

        "title": "Meet Statikk: The Rising Star of East Coast Rap",
        "description": "\nIf you haven’t heard of Statikk yet, you’re in for a treat. Martin Lamonte Hunter, born July 10, 2003, and better known by his stage name Statikk, is a young, dynamic force in the rap game. Hailing from Sanford, North Carolina, Statikk is already making waves as a rapper, record producer, and actor. His unique blend of melodic rhyming, catchy wordplay, and thought-provoking lyrics has quickly earned him a reputation as one of the greatest young rappers of his time.\nSo, what sets Statikk apart from the rest? Let’s dive into his story and what makes his music resonate with fans worldwide.\nStatikk’s connection to music began early. Growing up in a religious household, he was immersed in the church from a young age, where he started playing the drums. His passion for music became his refuge—a way to channel both his joys and struggles. Like many great artists, Statikk found solace in his craft, using it to navigate the complexities of life.\nRaised in a community where music was a constant presence, Statikk’s exposure to different genres, especially hip-hop, set the stage for his future success. He grew up listening to influential artists such as Lil Wayne, Future, and Kendrick Lamar—each of whom played a significant role in shaping his sound. This diverse range of influences gave Statikk the foundation to develop a distinctive style, blending East Coast rap culture with his personal touch.\n\nStatikk’s rise to fame began in 2024 with the release of his debut solo single, “ON DAT”. The track quickly caught the attention of rap enthusiasts for its raw energy, catchy beats, and relatable lyrics. In “ON DAT,” Statikk dives into the lifestyle and struggles of his community, addressing issues like gun violence and the instability faced by young people.\nWhat makes Statikk’s music stand out is his ability to blend meaningful themes with a captivating, almost hypnotic flow. His lyrics aren’t just about what’s cool—they tell real stories about life in East Coast neighborhoods, drawing listeners into his world. His signature style of melodic rhyming, repetition, syncopation, and alliteration gives his songs a unique, rhythmic appeal that resonates with fans.\nOne of the standout elements of Statikk’s music is his ability to tackle serious social issues with a style that’s undeniably catchy. His lyrics often touch on themes such as gun violence, social inequality, and the importance of stability for the youth. These topics may seem heavy, but Statikk manages to address them with a sound that keeps you hooked.\nHis music embodies the essence of East Coast rap—gritty, authentic, and filled with the pulse of real-life experiences. At the same time, Statikk incorporates melodic elements that give his tracks a modern twist. This combination of street-wise rap and socially conscious lyrics is what makes Statikk a voice for the youth and a rising star in the rap scene.\nStatikk draws inspiration from some of the biggest names in hip-hop, particularly from the East Coast. Artists like Lil Wayne, Future, and Kendrick Lamar have had a profound impact on his musical style. However, Statikk has managed to take those influences and create something distinctly his own.\nFor instance, the way he plays with words and rhythm—often using syncopation and repetition—echoes the lyrical genius of Lil Wayne. At the same time, Statikk’s introspective approach to his lyrics and his ability to tackle complex social issues mirrors Kendrick Lamar’s influence. And like Future, Statikk knows how to balance infectious beats with personal storytelling, making his music both enjoyable and meaningful.\nAs of now, Statikk is just getting started. With the success of“ON DAT”and growing recognition in the rap community, the sky’s the limit for this young artist. Statikk’s commitment to authenticity and his ability to blend personal stories with broader social issues will continue to set him apart as he expands his reach.\nHis music has already gained a loyal following, and fans are eagerly awaiting what comes next. Statikk’s next projects are bound to push boundaries, combining innovative production with the thought-provoking lyrics that have become his trademark.\nYou can also check out his latest track,“Untitled Freestyle”, where Statikk continues to showcase his raw talent and unapologetic style.\nIn a short amount of time, Statikk has established himself as a force to be reckoned with in the hip-hop world. His blend of melodic hooks, rhythmic wordplay, and socially conscious lyrics make him stand out in a crowded music industry. Statikk isn’t just another rapper—he’s an artist with a message, and his music speaks to the struggles, hopes, and dreams of a generation.\nAs he continues to grow and evolve as an artist, Statikk’s impact on the music scene is only going to expand. Whether you’re a fan of East Coast rap or just someone looking for fresh, authentic music, Statikk is an artist you’ll want to keep on your radar. The best is yet to come, and with Statikk at the forefront, the future of rap looks brighter than ever.\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nLos Angeles, CA – Buri, the innovative artist with a fresh and captivating approach to Christian hip-hop, is back with his latest single, “WHO YOU FOLLOW.” The track, which blends smooth, melodic rhythms with a modern hip-hop twist, is setting a new tone for Christian music—one that speaks directly to a younger generation seeking authenticity, inspiration, and a real connection with God.\nThis release marks a significant shift in the Christian rap scene, offering a relatable, easygoing message that resonates with youth culture worldwide.\n“WHO YOU FOLLOW” was born out of a deeply personal season in Buri’s life when he began to take his walk with Christ seriously. “I was looking around and noticing how many people are lost and yearning for something greater,” Buri explains. “I felt compelled to remind people that, without God in your life, there’s an emptiness that nothing else can fill. The message is simple: follow God.”\nThis powerful message is infused with infectious energy, making it an ideal anthem for those navigating their faith in the modern world. The track was written, produced, and recorded entirely by Buri himself in his home studio. He found inspiration from the production style of artists like NF, whose ability to create emotionally charged and sonically rich music left a lasting impression. “NF’s music inspired me to create something that’s not just a song but a piece of art,” he says.\n“I want my music to connect with people on a deeper level, to move them, and ultimately encourage them to build a relationship with God.”\nIn “WHO YOU FOLLOW,” Buri delivers a mix of introspection and raw authenticity. The track features a powerful vocal sample, titled “reverence,” which sets the tone for the song’s reflective lyrics.\nThe chorus, “Who you follow, ’cause I follow God,” serves as a rallying cry for listeners to examine their own faith journeys and the influences that shape their lives. Buri’s creative process was organic, with the lyrics flowing naturally from the beat he crafted. The moment he stumbled upon the phrase “Who you follow,” it became the foundation for the entire song, creating a mantra for listeners to live by. With “WHO YOU FOLLOW,” Buri is not just making music—he’s creating a movement. The song speaks to those in search of meaning and direction, offering a melodic but powerful reminder to stay grounded in faith.\n“I want listeners to feel inspired, to feel that ‘ugh’ moment when they realize they’re capable of building a stronger connection with God,” Buri shares. His commitment to authenticity and artistry is evident in every element of the track, from the beat to the lyrics.\nThis single marks just the beginning of what promises to be an exciting year for Buri.\nWith his next single, “IN THE WATER,” released on February 25th, the artist continues to push boundaries within the Christian rap scene, carving a space for his unique sound and message.\nFans can follow Burimakesmusic on Instagram (@burimakesmusic) and TikTok (@burimakesmusic) for the latest updates and music releases.\nFor more information on Burimakesmusic and to stream “WHO YOU FOLLOW,” check out his official social media links below:\n\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "Da Foundation Releases Captivating New Single “Skeptical”",
        "description": "\n\nRooted in rhythmic sophistication, Da Foundation is establishing a signature style that transcends the bounds of genre. With influence from R&B and Golden Era hip-hop, the pair of brothers is seamlessly blending their unique personalities into one coherent sound. Their tracks are adorned with irresistibly catchy hooks that linger in the mind long after the music fades. The magic of Da Foundation lies in their ability to produce heavy bars, rich with substance, and layer them in rhythmic tendrils that coil around the melody and beat. This dynamic duo is exploring profoundly relatable content in their verses, creating a lyrical tapestry that resonates with the very essence of the human spirit.\nRaised in East Orange, New Jersey, Mustaiin “Mu Smoova Don” and Malcolm “Mile Casso” developed an appreciation for music in their formative years. Although their rapping and songwriting began as a hobby in their youth, the fusion of freestyling and deliberate lyricism eventually became an art form. After the brothers relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina, they began collaborating and taking their work more seriously. Da Foundation was formed and immediately gained attention from the local scene. Appearing at open mic nights led to opportunities for bigger performances. Soon, Da Foundation was headlining their own events and building a solid fanbase. Their career began to unfold through various mixtapes and projects that serve as milestones in their story.\nDa Foundation’s newest single, “Skeptical,” addresses the feelings of doubt experienced from peers during a challenging period when support and encouragement were crucial. In this context, Da Foundation found it necessary to depend on their own resilience to ensure that the current moment does not mirror the skepticism they faced. The track was produced by Dreez of Global Sound. The group’s distinctive approach to this song is unconventional and markedly different from their earlier works. “We didn’t think it could fit on any project we were working on, we had to release it as a single,” stated Casso.\nConnect:\nwww.Instagram.com/alleyway2broadway\nwww.facebook.com/dafoundationmusic\nwww.x.com/da_foundation\nwww.YouTube.com/c/dafoundation\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "Y.O, also known as Young Ollie, is a rising star in the music scene. Born and raised in Flushing, Queens, New York, Travell Washington, known by his stage name Y.O, is on a mission to share his story with the world through his unique blend of rap music. While his musical journey began at just 16, the passion he has for it now is unlike anything he’s ever felt before. But who is Y.O? And what makes his music so special?\nLet’s take a deeper look at Y.O’s journey, the influences that shaped his sound, and what’s next for this rising artist.\nStarting out in New York City, Y.O grew up surrounded by the vibrant culture of hip-hop. Flushing, Queens, is a diverse neighborhood with a rich musical history, which made it the perfect backdrop for someone like Y.O to discover his love for music. As a teenager, he soaked up everything he could get his hands on. He wasn’t just listening to one type of music—Y.O was all about variety. From rap legends like Biggie, Jay-Z, Slick Rick, Nas, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac, his ears were open to the best of the best. Each of these influential figures played a role in shaping his sound and gave him the tools to carve his own unique space in the music industry.\nBut while he appreciated a variety of genres, it was rap that truly stuck with him.

And that passion is something Y.O continues to channel into his music today.\n\nNow living in North Carolina, Y.O has stepped into a new chapter of his life.

Biggie Smalls, Jay-Z, Slick Rick, Nas, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac are just a few of the legends who have impacted Y.O’s style. These artists didn’t just influence his music—they also helped shape his mindset and approach to the industry.\nEach of these iconic figures brought something unique to the table, whether it was Biggie’s storytelling ability, Jay-Z’s lyricism, or Snoop Dogg’s laid-back vibe. Y.O took bits and pieces from all of them and combined them with his own life experiences to create something entirely fresh. His music speaks to the heart of hip-hop, while also blending elements of his own identity and sound.\n\nAs Y.O continues to evolve as an artist, his latest music has shown just how far he’s come.

        "description": "\nListen to “Metroid Freestyle”\nAscendant boundary-pushing duoET Boysare back to shake things up with their latest release, “Metroid Freestyle” out March 7th. Fusing underground hip-hop, nu-metal grit, and trap-infused beats this electrifying single showcases the signature chemistry between Tacboy (vocals) and Sharkeyes (producer), two Latino brothers whose “Nu Pop Melodic Rap” sound continues to defy expectations. “Metroid Freestyle” delivers an unfiltered, raw intensity—melancholic synth melodies intertwining with distorted, lo-fi guitar textures. Paired with Tacboy’s dynamic flow, seamlessly shifting between rapid-fire verses and haunting melodic hooks, the duo has conjured up an undeniable earworm poised for heavy rotation.\nAdding to the track’s heavyweight production,ET Boysenlisted GRAMMY-winning producer Drew Correa (Lil Wayne, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Trina, Swizz Beatz). The resident Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records engineer behind Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter II and Birdman and Lil Wayne’s Like Father Like Son, Correa reunites with ET Boys after producing “Love Me If You Must” and “Hell of a Night,” bringing his signature polish to their ever-evolving sound.\nWith Tacboy describing the track as an embodiment of “beautiful production and pure power,” “Metroid Freestyle” is poised to fuel ET Boys’ unstoppable momentum and add to their remarkable run of successes. The pair has already made a splash in the indie music scene, achieving three #1 hits on the Digital Radio Tracker Independent Charts with tracks like “Bong Bong,” “This Is Us,” and “Until Forever”—the latter also claiming the top spot on the Untapped KAZI Austin chart. Several of their songs, including “Love Me If You Must,” continue to climb the DRT Global, Independent, and Hip Hop Charts. Their debut single “Sober” amassed over 1 million streams on Spotify, and their first album, Forever Night, has crossed the 3 million-stream mark. Their 2024 EP Paopu quickly hit 1 million streams on Spotify, helping them grow to over 117k monthly listeners.\nHailing from South Florida’s Miami-Broward scene, ET Boys’ Tacboy leads as the vocalist and lyricist, crafting melodies and lyrics for songs written and performed by his brother, Sharkeyes. Both trained in piano from a young age—Tacboy also on guitar, Sharkeyes on drums—they performed in church and school before heading to college. There, an unexpected collaboration emerged: Sharkeyes shared his compositions, and Tacboy added vocals and lyrics. In under two years, they created over 30 songs, catching the attention of Pepper Gomez, who signed them to Wake Up! Music in 2021.\nTacboy, a signed model, embodies the spirit of Jim Morrison with a magnetic presence, effortlessly weaving poetry into music—often in a single take. As the frontman of ET Boys, he captivates with his voice, lyrics, and striking look while also exploring solo projects in Nu House and Alt genres. Behind the scenes, Sharkeyes crafts the tracks Tacboy brings to life, blending diverse influences with signature drum beats and layered melodies. A composer, producer, classical pianist, and live drummer, Sharkeyes remains the enigmatic force behind the mask, his Megaman physique, Virgin Mary tattoo, and intense style adding to his mystique.\nWith “Metroid Freestyle,” Tacboy and Sharkeyes further shape the ET Boys’ dynamic sound. Their deep bond fuels a seamless fusion of genres, pushing musical boundaries with each release. As they carve their own lane, ET Boys stand as a testament to artistic connection and brotherhood, delivering bold and innovative music as they gear up for their next full-length album in 2025.\n© 2025,@BWyche.

Once recognized by the platform under her stage name, “Shai Snead,” her profile was removed at the request of her former team without her knowledge. Now, she is on a mission to have it reinstated, emphasizing how vital it is to her career and personal journey.\nHailing from Richmond, VA, Shai Snead has built a name for herself as an influencer, model, and recording artist. She first gained recognition for her fashion-forward presence on Instagram before expanding into music, where she’s been making waves with her unique blend of rap, Afrobeats, and West Coast-influenced sounds. Despite her ongoing success, an unexpected and devastating loss occurred when her Famous Birthdays profile was removed without her consent.\n“I only realized the impact of this decision after it was too late,” Shai stated. “Losing that part of my online presence and legacy has been deeply regrettable.”\nHaving been unaware of the decision made by her previous team, she now finds herself in a frustrating battle to restore what was taken from her.

The platform acts as a hub where fans, industry professionals, and the media can access key details about an artist’s career, background, and accomplishments. For Shai Snead, having her profile removed feels like a setback in her career, one that she’s determined to overcome.\nNow working with a new, more supportive team, Shai has taken steps to prove her identity and establish her credibility. She has provided substantial documentation, including original emails, data from when her profile was active, and even correspondence regarding its removal. With this evidence, she remains hopeful that the platform will recognize her rightful claim and restore her presence.\nShai’s journey in the entertainment industry has been marked by resilience and reinvention. From her early days as a model and event host in the DMV area to working with notable Afrobeats artists like Icebeatchillz and Uptown Bwoy, she has continuously evolved. Her music, infused with diverse influences and a West Coast flair, reflects her growth as an artist.\nAs she prepares for new releases and continues to build her fan base, Shai knows that reclaiming her Famous Birthdays profile is more than just an administrative hurdle—it’s about reclaiming her story.\n“I understand I’ve reached out multiple times, but this is truly important to me,” she expressed. “Restoring my profile would help me reclaim an essential piece of my journey and support my continued growth in the industry.”\nWith an unwavering determination, Shai Snead is proving that she won’t let past decisions define her future. Her story is one of persistence, passion, and an unyielding drive to secure her rightful place in the entertainment world.\nFollow Shai Snead’s journey and stay updated on her latest music and projects by connecting with her on Instagram@shaisnead.\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "description": "\nTrixxie Morella is an artist whose journey is as diverse and dynamic as her music. Originally from a small town in Louisiana, she was raised across a patchwork of regions, including Texas, Mississippi, and the Northeast, moving from state to state and city to city. This nomadic lifestyle shaped her into the versatile artist she is today. While her roots stretch across the South and Northeast, Morella’s heart will always be tied to the “dirty South,” where she feels most at home. Her upbringing not only influenced her musical style but also helped her develop a unique perspective on the world.\nFor Morella, being an artist goes beyond simply creating art—it is a fundamental part of her existence. “Every word I speak and every movement I make is art,” she explains. “It’s the mode of self-expression that I rely on to survive and cope with the world.” Music and art are more than just professions for Morella; they are the channels through which she processes her thoughts, emotions, and experiences, making art an essential tool for both survival and expression.\nDrawing inspiration from the world around her, Morella finds creative fuel in the people, places, and events that shape her life. She is particularly influenced by figures like Lil Wayne, whose impact is reflected in her own music. Her recent track, “Dyke Lil Wayne,” showcases not only her lyrical prowess and unique flows but also her desire to blend fun with depth, capturing both a sense of playfulness and personal pride. The song is a tribute to her Black queerness and celebrates her roots in Louisiana.\nMorella’s artistic journey began early. Growing up in a musically and artistically gifted family, she was drawn to the performing arts and attended specialized schools that honed her talents. Creativity is in her blood, and she has been making music for as long as she can remember. “I don’t stop because it’s how I live,” she shares, illustrating her deep commitment to her craft.\nA pivotal moment in Morella’s journey came when she returned to Louisiana on her 24th birthday. Seeking to reconnect with her heritage and self, she found a magical space in New Orleans, where she collaborated with Turn Up 504 Studios. It was here that she was able to channel the artistic energy that had been missing from her life in New York City. With the help of producer Pnom On Da Track and mixer Lil Wildlife, she created “Dyke Lil Wayne,” a track that not only celebrates her identity but also shines a spotlight on her beloved home state.\nThrough her music, Trixxie Morella has created a powerful narrative of self-expression, artistic freedom, and cultural pride. Each track she produces is a piece of her soul, and her journey as an artist is one of continual discovery, connection, and celebration of who she truly is.\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "DJ ES-P Revives a Forgotten Era with His Debut Album",
        "description": "\n\nStraight out of Newark, NJ, DJ ES-Pro—also known as DJ ES-P—is a DJ and producer who’s keeping the heart of hip-hop alive while pushing it into new territory. His sound is a mix of old-school soul and modern edge—blending jazz, R&B, and funk. You can hear the influence of hip-hop’s golden era in everything he touches, but he’s not stuck in the past—he’s moving the culture forward.\nHis journey started at home, watching his older brother, Tariq Jabez, who first introduced him to music. From there, under the mentorship of E-Swann at Take Flight Productions, DJ ES-P began to shape his sound. Early collaborations with groups like Sez Who, B.L.O.C.S., and H.O.P.E. gave him the foundation to grow into the producer he is today—someone known for crafting records that are raw, soulful, and always authentic.\nOver the years, DJ ES-P has worked with a long list of respected artists—Mach Hommy, Planet Asia, Queen Lex, and more. His production isn’t just about making beats—it’s about creating a feeling, telling a story, and honoring the roots of hip-hop while carving out something fresh.\nFor DJ ES-P, this work isn’t just a job—it’s a calling. “The talent I have isn’t mine alone—it comes from the Most High God, I am just the vessel,” he says. That belief keeps him grounded, even as the music industry constantly shifts.\nWhen he’s locked in on a project, DJ ES-P protects his creative space. He avoids listening to other music while working, ensuring his ideas stay original. “I want the music to come from a real place,” he explains. And it’s that focus that sets his work apart.\nA key part of his process is his partnership with Cris “Bass Boy Cris” Williams, a Grammy-winning engineer who helps bring his vision to life. “An engineer can make or break a record,” DJ ES-P says. “Cris understands the vision—he listens, he’s patient, and he’s got the skills to make everything hit just right.”\nWhen collaborating with artists, DJ ES-P takes a hands-on approach. He’s not the type to just send out random beats and hope for the best. Instead, he studies the artist—their sound, their strengths—and works with them to craft something unique. If possible, he prefers to be in the studio together. “The energy is different when we’re in the same room,” he says. “You can feel it in the music.”\n\nIn a world where anyone with a laptop can call themselves a producer, DJ ES-P makes an important distinction: “A beatmaker just sends out beats. A producer is involved in the whole process—making sure the record is right.”\nThat means he’s not afraid to speak up if something isn’t working. Whether it’s adjusting a verse, tweaking a hook, or asking for another take, DJ ES-P is all about delivering the best version of a song. “If it’s not right, I’ll say so,” he admits. “The goal is to make the best music possible—no shortcuts.”\nWhile hip-hop is his first love, his creativity doesn’t stop there. He’s currently working on neo-soul and jazz projects, expanding his sound while staying true to the essence of music from the soul.\nHis latest project, ‘DJ ES-P Presents: The Lab Mixtape,’ is more than just a collection of songs—it’s a statement. Produced entirely by him and mixed by Cris “Bass Boy Cris” Williams, the mixtape brings together some of the sharpest lyricists while blending gritty boom-bap with modern textures.\nIt’s a love letter to hip-hop’s past and a vision for its future. Every track feels intentional—raw, unfiltered, and packed with energy. If you’re craving real hip-hop, this is it.\nYou can experience ‘The Lab Mixtape’ for yourself—it’s available now on Even.biz.\nDespite everything he’s accomplished, DJ ES-P stays humble. He’s constantly learning, drawing inspiration from legends like Pete Rock, RZA, DJ Premier, and a list of other pioneers who paved the way. “I’m always a student,” he says. “The moment you think you know it all, you stop growing.”\nFor DJ ES-P, it all comes back to the music—the culture—the energy. Every beat, every project is part of a bigger legacy. And as long as he’s behind the boards, you can be sure that legacy will stay alive and well.\nCheck out DJ ES-P Presents: The Lab Mixtape—available now on Even.biz.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "Collin Gibson Returns With The Golden Era – A Sonic Tribute to Hip Hop’s Most Influential Decade",
        "description": "\n\nMilwaukee-born hip-hop artist Collin Gibson is back with his highly anticipated 13th full-length album, The Golden Era—a project that pays homage to the music that shaped him. Raised on the sounds of Outkast, Blackstar, The Roots, UGK, and more, Gibson has spent years carving out a unique artistic identity that defies easy classification.\nBut for those who have followed his journey, reinvention is nothing new.\nBig Tah, one of Atlanta’s most respected event promoters, recalls witnessing Gibson’s transformation firsthand:\n“Collin Gibson was the first artist to bring what became our core audience out at Tru Skool Tuesday. Back then, he was known as NDB and had a record called ‘Cuffin’—a fun, feel-good track that made girls want to dance. It was a hit because people responded to it. But then I watched him go through some sort of metamorphosis. One night, he took the stage and performed a song I think was called ‘Back Pack’—and in that moment, NDB died, and Collin Gibson the artist was born. He didn’t just want to entertain—he wanted to say something. He became an artist who would forever evolve, always one step ahead.”\nThat evolution continues with The Golden Era, a raw, bass-driven, and lyrically rich tribute to the ‘90s—hip-hop’s most iconic decade. The album pulls from every corner of the culture, blending freestyle-inspired bars, Southern-influenced grooves, and heartfelt storytelling.\nOne of the standout tracks, “Black Ice,” embodies the Midwest riding sound, featuring smooth lyricism, a bass-heavy beat, and a hypnotic melodic hook. The song is a historic moment for Gibson, as it marks the first time he has collaborated with his mother, Melody Wynn, a celebrated performer in her own right. Wynn’s career has taken her to major stages, including residencies in Atlantic City and opening for Elton John at Harley Davidson’s 100th Anniversary Festival at Summerfest in Milwaukee. Her presence on “Black Ice” brings a depth of soul and legacy to the track, bridging generations of musical excellence.\n“This album is just me making the kind of hip-hop I love,” says Gibson. “It’s a tribute to the music that raised me, the artists who inspired me, and the freedom that hip-hop gives us to keep pushing forward.”\nCollin Gibson has never been an artist to follow trends—he’s a creator, an innovator, and a lyricist with a vision that refuses to be confined. With The Golden Era, he invites listeners to experience a sound that is both nostalgic and refreshingly original—a bridge between hip-hop’s past and its limitless future.\nThe Golden Era is available now on all major streaming platforms.\nFor bookings, press inquiries, or interview requests, contact:\n📩[email protected]\n📲 @collingibsonmusic\nWebsite:www.imaforever.comwww.collingibson.bandzoogle.com\n#CollinGibson #TheGoldenEra #HipHop #MidwestRap #BlackIce #MelodyWynn #GoldenAge #LiveMusic #NewAlbum\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\n\nMississippi-born artist YoBoi L has been making waves with his track*Black Sheep. Known for transforming his music into personal therapy, YoBoi L expresses his life experiences with raw authenticity. His storytelling brings real-life situations to the forefront, allowing listeners to connect deeply with his journey.\nHis musical path began humbly—recording his first mixtape, *L-Town*, in his sister’s closet. That project became a local classic, with fans still quoting lyrics to this day. Hand-pressing CDs, selling them around his city, and organizing major video shoots in his hometown, YoBoi L built his name from the ground up. But he’s not just here for personal success—he’s on a mission to inspire. He wants to guide the next generation by sharing the lessons he’s learned, both good and bad, ensuring that his influence lasts beyond the music.\nYoBoi L refuses to box himself into one category, embracing versatility as his strength. Inspired by legends like Bun B and Pimp C, he values authenticity and boldness in his lyrics. His unique style allows him to connect with a wide range of audiences, making his impact even greater. His ultimate goal? To go platinum. As he puts it, “Just like they say the greats aren’t considered a GOAT until they win at least one ring,” he knows that a platinum plaque will cement his legacy. His dedication, drive, and relentless consistency make him stand out in an industry where perseverance is everything.\nHis hard work has taken him beyond Mississippi, performing from Miami to New York and everywhere in between. Touring with *The Hood Idol Tour* (Lex Luga) and *Next to Blow Tour* (Magassia), YoBoi L has seen the grind up close. Even when he didn’t win certain showcases, a stranger’s words of encouragement pushed him to keep going—a moment that helped shape his *Boss Mentality*. That same mentality has earned him multiple award nominations, including “Rap Hustler of the Year” and “Slept on Artist of the Year” at the Mississippi Hip Hop Culture Awards.\nWhether he’s in the studio, on stage, or speaking in interviews, YoBoi L is on a mission to motivate. He constantly reminds people that their dreams are within reach, as long as they stay determined. His relentless grind is proof that success is possible through hard work and perseverance. One of the best pieces of advice he’s ever received? “Keep going, keep going.” As he raps in *GOD FAVOR*, “Mud racing through the quicksand, mad now I had a quit then—keep going.”\nWith *Black Sheep*, YoBoi L continues to prove why he’s an artist to watch. His journey is far from over—this is just another chapter in a legacy that’s still being written.\nConnect:\nInstagram:www.instagram.com/yoboi_l\n© 2025,StanleyGatero. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nEvery artist has a story, but some stories don’t just shape the music—they define it. Siraj Singsathitsuk isn’t just making songs; he’s turning life’s most personal battles into melodies that resonate far beyond his own experience.\nBorn and raised in Thailand with deep Indian roots, Siraj grew up between cultures, in a space where identity was fluid, and music became his anchor. “Creating a song feels like gathering all your thoughts and emotions and transforming them into something you can feel,” he says. And when life changed in an instant at just 15 years old, music became more than just expression—it became survival.\nDiagnosed with Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), Siraj found himself in a world that looked different overnight. What was once clear became blurred, distant, uncertain. “I never knew how challenging life could become until I experienced it myself,” he admits. But where some might have seen limits, Siraj found something else: a reason to create.\nHis debut single,“Pulling Me Back,”isn’t just a song—it’s a journey. Love, friendship, masculinity, identity—it’s all there, wrapped in melodies that carry both pain and hope. “This song is me,” he says. “Every line, every word. It’s about feeling lost and searching for something to bring you back.”\nAnd that’s the beauty of Siraj’s music—it’s deeply personal, yet universal. He understands struggle, but he also believes in the light at the end of it. “Everything in life happens for a reason, and in the end, it will be good,” he reflects.\nSiraj isn’t here to follow trends. He’s here to build something real, to craft a sound that connects, and to create a space where listeners can escape—just as he has. With big dreams of making music videos and sharing his art with the world, he knows the journey is just beginning. “I want people to vibe with my songs no matter where they are in life,” he says.\nWith raw emotion, a compelling story, and a voice that carries resilience, Siraj Singsathitsuk is an artist you won’t just listen to—you’ll feel. And as his music pulls him forward, it’s bound to pull listeners along with him.\nFollow Siraj\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sirajsinghmusic/\nWatch ‘Pulling Me Back’\nhttps://youtu.be/gv0Qd08Rk2Y?si=5dhmBrrO4JHDziSp\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nHip-hop artistAshwin Gane is a boundary-pushing hip-hop artist, producer, and songwriter redefining the intersection of cinematic sound and storytelling.Hailing fromDetroit,Ashwin Ganeblends hisIndiancultural roots with modern hip-hop, creating a unique sonic experience that fuses symphonic orchestration with hard-hitting rap.With a commanding bass-baritone voice and a storyteller’s precision, he crafts music that balances raw intensity with melodic finesse.\nWe chatted with Ashwin to discuss his newsingle“Energy”,a smooth, laid-back track about instant chemistry, attraction, and enjoying the moment.\nCongrats on your latest release “Energy”.What’s thenew songabout?\nThank you! “Energy”is flirty, confident, and smooth. It’s about feeling like the guy, moving through life effortlessly, and letting your energy do the work. Whether you’re in the club, riding through the city, or just soaking in the moment, it’s the kind of song that makes you feel untouchable.\nWhen you start to make a song,what comes firstbeat or lyrics?\nFor me, the beat always comes first—98% of the time. The production sets the mood and dictates the direction of the lyrics. Before I even start writing, I listen to the instrumental and let it guide me. The rhythm, the chords, the overallfeel,they all tell me what kind of song it’s going to be before I even put a pen to paper.\nInterestingly, this beat actually started as something I originally made for a soundtrack. The person I was working with at the time passed on it because they wanted something more aggressive, even though they specifically asked for an R&B track. That just reinforced something I’ve learned over time: some people don’t actually know what they want or need. But I knew.\nFrom the beginning, I knew I wanted something R&B-driven but with a bounce. The beat had that throwback R&B feel—smooth, luxurious, and effortlessly cool. It had that late-night vibe, something you could imagine playing at an upscale lounge or cruising through the city at night. Even though it’s modern, it has that 90s glam rap and R&B fusion—that rich, indulgent feel that makes it timeless.\nThat’s why I always start with the beat. It sets the mood, tells me what the song is supposed to feel like, and the rest follows. The instrumental already had its own personality—I just had to match its energy.\nLove that!How did the lyrics match up with the instrumental?\nThe first spark for thesong came from my own interactions and experiences with people.Something I hear all the time is, “I love your energy” or “I love your vibe.” It’s one of those phrases that stuck with me because it happens so often.There’s something about energy, presence, and aura that plays a huge role in attraction, sometimes even more than words or looks.After that initial vibe,came from a feeling I think everyone can relate to—that moment where you wonder, “Are they into me?” Whether it’s a stranger, someone you just met, or even someone you’ve known for a while, there’s always that curiosity. Initially, I thought about making the song lean into that uncertainty, but as soon as I sat with the beat, I knew that wasn’t the right direction.\nThe music video for the song was also just released.What canfans expect from it?\nFriends and supporters can expect a fun, entertaining, and luxurious visual that fully immerses them in the lifestyle of this playboy main character. Unlike some of my more serious videos—like Outside, which had a dark, cinematic, and atmospheric feel. this one is all about confidence, indulgence, and having a good time. It’s lighthearted, smooth, and dripping with style.\nThe video takes you through a full night in the life of this character. You see him getting ready because, of course, presentation is everything. Then you see him arrive at the club, moving through the scene with effortless cool, completely unbothered, like he owns the place. Inside, he’s lounging in luxury, surrounded by beautiful women, sipping on Hennessy, fully in his element. And then, of course, the night doesn’t end when the lights come on there’s always an afterparty, and that’s where things get even more intimate.\nVisually, it’s bold, vibrant, and stylish, with deep blues, golden hues, and neon lighting that give it that high-end, nightlife feel. It has the energy of a 90s glam rap video: smooth, flashy, and larger than life but with a modern twist. Everything about it, from the wardrobe to the way the scenes are framed, plays into that world of effortless confidence and luxury.\nHow canpeople keep up with your news?\nYou can find my latest music andnews on mysocial media platformshereand on mywebsite.\nFeel the “Energy”and watch the music videohere:\n\n© 2025,Variety Press.

The single currently sits at #117 on the charts, demonstrating remarkable longevity in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.\nThis sustained chart performance adds to one of Showoff Gang/Empire’s flagship artists’ impressive track record, particularly as Tjuan Benafactor continues to build on his established career & chart successes. While his single “Giggity” recently reached #36 on the iTunes US Top 40 Hip-Hop/Rap charts last week, it had previously peaked at #7 on the iTunes UK Hip-Hop/Rap charts in January 2025, marking one of several high-charting releases throughout his career.\n“The consistent performance of ‘No Laccin’ for over two months speaks volumes about the organic support we’ve received from fans and industry tastemakers alike,” said Bantana. “Collaborating with an icon like Snoop elevated the track, but it’s the authentic connection with our audience that’s kept it in rotation this long.”\nBuilding on this momentum, Benafactor & Bantana are finalizing plans for their anticipated “It’s No Time For Laccin” promotional tour, scheduled for late spring through early summer 2025. With booking currently underway for markets across the country.\n“What’s happening with Benafactor & Bantana exemplifies our label’s approach to artist development,” added J-Haze of Showoff Gang/Empire. “We’re witnessing the perfect alignment of consistently strong releases, strategic collaborations, and the right timing. The upcoming tour will capitalize on the buzz they’ve built through these chart successes.”\nIndustry analysts note that maintaining chart presence for ten weeks is particularly noteworthy, even for artists with established chart histories like Benafactor. This achievement positions Benafactor & Bantana as one of 2025’s breakthrough hip-hop duos to watch.\nThe “It’s No Time For Laccin” tour dates will be announced in the coming weeks, with pre-sale opportunities for fans who have supported the single across streaming platforms. “No Laccin” featuring Snoop Dogg is available now on all major streaming services.\nFor more information, interview requests, or press inquiries, please contact:[email protected]\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\n\nSapien Medicine is pioneering a unique fusion of sound and healing, offering listeners an innovative approach to personal wellness. By crafting immersive soundscapes that delve into the concept of Morphic Fields—energy patterns believed to influence physical and mental states—Sapien Medicine provides an experience that transcends traditional music.\nYour work with Sapien Medicine has garnered a substantial following. What inspired you to explore the intersection of sound and healing?\nSapien Medicine: My journey began in the realm of metal music, where I was deeply involved as a vocalist. Over time, I became fascinated by the profound impact sound can have on the human psyche and physiology. This curiosity led me to investigate how auditory experiences could be harnessed for healing and personal growth, ultimately giving birth to Sapien Medicine.\nMorphic Fields or Energy Fields play a central role in your creations. Could you elaborate on this concept and its integration into your work?\nSapien Medicine: Certainly. Morphic Fields are theoretical energy patterns that influence behaviours and physical forms. (Rupert Sheldrake theories) By embedding specific intentions and frequencies into our soundscapes, we aim to tap into these fields, facilitating positive changes in our listeners’ well-being. It’s a harmonious blend of ancient wisdom and contemporary sound design.\nYour album “Tuath Dé” marked a significant evolution in your artistic approach. What sets this project apart from your earlier works?\nSapien Medicine: “Tuath Dé,” released in June 2020, represents a pivotal moment where I sought to craft not just music, but an energetic journey. The album intertwines sound, emotion, and mythology, guiding listeners through mystical realms inspired by the legendary Tuath Dé. This endeavour was about creating an immersive experience that resonates on a deeper, more transformative level.\nYour recent works draw inspiration from vintage video game music and jazz. How do these influences align with your overarching mission?\nSapien Medicine: Exploring genres like synthwave and jazz allows me to connect with listeners through familiar yet innovative soundscapes. By infusing nostalgic elements with healing intentions, we create accessible entry points for individuals to experience the therapeutic potential of sound. It’s about bridging the gap between the known and the unknown, making the journey of healing both engaging and transformative.\nFor newcomers to Sapien Medicine, which tracks would you recommend as an introduction to your work?\nSapien Medicine: “Depths of Your Soul” from ‘Album 4’ (2021) offers a deep appreciation of one’s being and the world. “Angelic Blessings” (2024) features twelve tracks dedicated to specific archangels, providing a spiritually enriching experience. Additionally, “The Flow” (2023) focuses on “Chi Environment Saturation,” exemplifying our approach to blending ancient concepts with modern audio techniques.\nLooking ahead, what can listeners anticipate from Sapien Medicine?\nSapien Medicine: We are continually exploring new sonic landscapes and healing modalities. Our upcoming projects aim to deepen the listener’s journey into self-discovery and well-being, incorporating diverse musical influences and cutting-edge sound design to create transformative experiences.\nSapien Medicine stands at the forefront of a new frontier in music and wellness, inviting listeners to embark on a journey where sound becomes a conduit for healing and personal evolution.\nStream “The Pranic Healer” below:\n\n\n\nhttps://music.apple.com/gb/artist/sapien-medicine/1514560620\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\n\nCobra is an emerging artist who was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, before relocating to Los Angeles in the early 2000s. On January 14, 2021, he alleges that he was wrongfully arrested in Miami and accused of being a terrorist. As depicted in police body cam footage, law enforcement surrounded him at the Miami airport, armed with high-powered M-16 rifles. According to Cobra, police falsely claimed he was carrying a bomb, despite him only having an iPad and an iPhone.\nHe asserts that he was taken by plainclothes officers and subjected to brutal treatment while in handcuffs, with threats of violence directed at his eight-year-old daughter. Cobra was denied access to legal representation and subsequently placed in county jail.\nAs a result of the injuries he sustained from police abuse, he was transferred to multiple hospitals for treatment over a period of three months. Upon his return to Los Angeles, sheriff’s deputies visited his home and confiscated his legally owned firearms, leaving him without means to protect himself and his daughter. This traumatic experience led to a diagnosis of severe PTSD due to the torture he experienced while restrained.\nCobra has since filed a civil rights lawsuit, emphasizing that no incriminating evidence was found on him at the airport. He attributes the incident to racial profiling.\nHis latest release, titled “Make It Out This Cell,” recounts his harrowing experience and was composed during his unjust incarceration.\nThe opinions and writings expressed in this article are solely those of Cobra, who gave us a first hand personal account of what he and his daughter experienced.\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

Dreaming allows an individual to transcend the limitations of their current reality and to explore the vast landscape of possibilities, igniting a spark of belief in the seemingly impossible.\nWhen you engage in the practice of visualizing your future, it cultivates a unique form of faith—one that nurtures self-confidence and inspires you to harness the latent talents resting within your soul.

It’s not just about choosing a career or a lifestyle; it’s about forging an identity that resonates with your core values and aspirations. Fighting for what you believe in, for your version of truth and destiny, is a journey fraught with challenges; many embark on this quest, yet only a select few manage to reach their ultimate destination.\nBelieving in the unthinkable requires a bold vision that transcends conventional boundaries. It is a perspective that can only be fully embraced and understood by the original thinker, the dreamer who dares to imagine what others deem impossible. This visionary mindset is crucial when embarking on the arduous task of building an empire—a process akin to constructing a grand fortress, brick by painstaking brick. It demands not only relentless patience but also a resilience grounded in Championship DNA—the unwavering spirit that pushes you to overcome obstacles—and a panoramic vision that allows you to see the broader landscape of potential and opportunity.\nUnderstanding the true significance and intrinsic value of your beliefs is a transformative experience, one that often feels surreal as it reshapes your worldview. Yet, most individuals falter at the threshold of their deepest fears, hesitating to confront the very obstacles that stand between them and their aspirations. To become legendary in your own right, one must cultivate the ability to absorb pain that goes beyond the ordinary, to rise above moments of despair, and to navigate through the shadows of uncertainty with unwavering resolve.\nIn essence, this journey is not for the faint-hearted; it is for those who are willing to embrace discomfort, tackle the unknown, and emerge stronger, wiser, and ultimately, more authentic in their pursuit of greatness.\nRecording Artist and EntrepreneurIAMJSINGis a rare gem in the music industry, embodying a unique blend of creativity and boldness that sets him apart from the crowd.

        "description": "\nTha Artist, more commonly known in hip-hop circles asLoso Tha Artist,doesn’t really fit a pre-determined stylistic box. He isn’t an overtly “conscious” emcee, a comedy rapper or an avant-garde obsessive; he just does him. The Omaha-based artist links withChicagobred producerUncle JoNH IIIfor their latest joint“Sophisticated Flow”. Loso keeps his sound signature, and departs from both normal hip-hop and spoken-word traditions through his cross-cultural merging of his and JoNH’s style. On “Sophisticated Flow” Loso proves he’s far from being an ego-driven, diamonds and fancy car rapper and ensconces the listener into his easily accessible, organic sound without the need of didacticism or forced abstraction.\n“Sophisticated Flow”is a fresh, delectably simple and original mutation which successfully marries head strong lyricism and rap sensibilities.Uncle JoNH IIIdelivers left field of his usual Soul-drenched, sample-heavy beats with more of a suspend and medley vibe with 808 surroundings. This joint is taken off their upcoming collaborative project“Before The Shine”.Characteristically scruffy and off-kilter, Loso is a fringe-dweller who’s contented to stay grounded in the face of stresses generated in the course of modern living.\nWhile sometimes talking witlessly and in mindless platitudes about the day-to-day struggle we all face, Loso prefers to gently massage his own wisdom into the roots of his music through a sound that is unmistakably of the old-school. Never ranting or rallying, though occasionally betraying his weariness with the current state of the hip-hop (a seemingly inescapable trope of underground hip-hop), Loso prefers, for the most part, to wax lyrical about his abiding love of family, street smarts, pain, and a life divested of high-octane distractions.\n“Sophisticated Flow”is solid proof that good music is very often, if not most often, simple music that coaxes traditional elements and occasional innovative flourishes into magical submission.\nStream“Sophisticated Flow”Here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tNnsfWWBfc\n& on all platforms and Follow:@Loso_Tha_Artist & @Uncle.JoNH3\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "Jay-Carter Music : ‘Italian Artists Need to Be Real, Not Copy Americans’",
        "description": "\nHipHopSince1987: Jay, thank you for joining us today. To start, I’d like to ask about your experience working with various artists in Milan.\nJay-Carter: Thank you for having me. My experience in Milan was intriguing but also somewhat disappointing. I noticed that many artists there are not truly committed to investing in their dreams. In contrast, I find more opportunities in Switzerland, where there is both financial support and a stronger work ethic among artists. In Italy, many expect others to handle everything for them, from writing lyrics to music production. This mindset was surprising to me.\nHipHopSince1987: You’ve mentioned that many Italian artists lack authenticity. Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?\nJay Carter: Certainly. I’ve observed that many Italian artists project an image that is not reflective of their reality. It often feels like an illusion aimed at young people aspiring to enter the music industry. Many rappers and trappers claim to represent street life and the struggles of the ghetto, but in reality, they come from privileged backgrounds. It’s a stark contrast to the experiences of American artists, who often speak from genuine life experiences.\nHipHopSince1987: You also shared some thoughts about Italian record labels. What is your perspective on them?\nJay-Carter: In my opinion, many Italian record labels operate with hidden mechanisms that help young artists secure financial backing to inflate their streaming numbers. However, despite the millions of streams some Italian artists accumulate on platforms like Spotify, record labels retain a significant portion of the earnings, leaving the artists with only a small fraction of the revenue.\n\nHipHopSince1987: You’ve had some challenging experiences in New York. How have those shaped your music?\nJay-Carter: Living in New York was incredibly difficult. I started from nothing and lived in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods, such as the Bronx and Ralph Avenue in Brooklyn. I even found myself caught in street violence, including shootings. These experiences not only shaped me as an artist but also gave me a unique perspective that I bring to my music. Additionally, I built financial success that I could never have achieved in Italy. Most importantly, I earned trust and respect on my own from the American community—something that Italian artists, without record labels acting as intermediaries, would struggle to accomplish as I did.\nInterviewer: What would you like to bring to Italy to support its artists?\nJay-Carter: My goal is to establish a bridge between Italy and the United States so that Italian artists don’t have to endure the same struggles I faced. However, my work and expertise come at a cost—I cannot provide these opportunities for free. I encourage truly committed artists to reach out to me. I firmly believe that the Italian rap scene needs to redefine its vision and cultivate its own identity rather than attempting to imitate the American style unsuccessfully.\nHipHopSince1987 : Before we conclude, is there anyone you would like to acknowledge?\nJay-Carter: Absolutely. I would like to extend my gratitude to HipHopSince1987 for their unwavering support and for providing me with the platform to share my journey. Their dedication to promoting hip-hop culture and giving artists a voice is invaluable. I truly appreciate their efforts.\nHipHopSince1987 : We understand you recently released a book. Could you share more details about it?\nJay-Carter: Certainly. I recently published a mini book titled The Art of Sound: Introduction to Sound Engineering through my record label, JCMG Records. It serves as a foundational guide for beginners looking to enter the world of studio recording and music production. The book covers fundamental concepts and industry insights to help aspiring producers and artists navigate the early stages of their careers. Additionally, I am currently working on the second volume, which will delve deeper into advanced techniques and professional studio workflows. The book is available in both paperback and digital formats on Amazon.\nHipHopSince1987 : Thank you, Jay. Do you have any final advice for young Italian artists?\nJay-Carter: Yes. My advice is to remain genuine and authentic. It’s far better to develop your own style and artistic vision than to poorly replicate someone else’s. Stay true to yourself and put in the hard work required to achieve your dreams.\nOfficial Website:jaycartermusic.com\nInstagram:@realjaycarter\nFacebook:JayCarterGroup\nYouTube:JayCarterMusicVEVO\nBuy on Amazon  :https://shorturl.at/wOUqZ\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nUnderstanding the direction and impact of personal pain is one of the most profound and defining moments in a person’s life. By comprehending the essence of their anguish and misfortunes, individuals can unlock and optimize their God-given talents, turning adversity into a powerful catalyst for growth. Once a person grasps the full extent of their pain, they gain the ability to navigate and manage the highest forms of pressure they encounter in their lives, enabling them to emerge stronger and more resilient.\nPursuing a ‘supreme being’ lifestyle necessitates an individual to traverse the path of greatest resistance. This journey toward elevated living not only broadens one’s perspective but also reveals the fuller spectrum of their destiny. Unfortunately, many individuals never reach the heights of their potential because they fall victim to life’s darker elements: fear, crippling self-doubt, and a lack of self-awareness. These obstacles can shroud one’s potential, preventing the realization of their dreams.\nIn the world of rap culture, the pursuit of immortality is a dream deeply ingrained in the aspirations of every emerging MC. Climbing the formidable mountain of Hip-Hop is not suited for the faint-hearted; it is a genre marked by both its cultural significance and its physical dangers. Within this dynamic landscape, Recording Artist and Entrepreneur OTM TONY stands out as a trailblazer, embodying the spirit of creative freedom for Generation Z.\nOTM TONYis not just an artist; he is a natural-born storyteller whose lyrics serve as a powerful blueprint for young dreamchasers striving to forge a better tomorrow for themselves. His unique psychological gift allows him to transform dark energy into inspirational lyrics, acting as a beacon of hope and motivation for Generation Z youth culture.\nHis latest single, “I Don’t Like,” has garnered significant attention from radio programmers at 99.7 DA HEAT MIAMI, a respected station on the iHeartRadio platform. This track is currently enjoying heavy rotation on airwaves, showcasing the growing influence of OTM TONY. 99.7 DA HEAT MIAMI operates as an interactive division ofRADIOPUSHERS,CERVO MEDIA GROUP INC, andMUSICHYPEBEAST,further amplifying the reach of artists like OTM TONY who are reshaping the landscape of modern music.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nYNGThePlug legally known as Dominique Selby is a 18 year old upcoming emerging artist from Jackson, Michigan a midsize city 80 miles from Detroit. At just the age of 10 Dominique started making comical diss tracks which would later develop into a hobby around the Soundcloud era at the peak of YNG’s interest in music which developed the dynamic and unique flow YNG posses today.\nWe asked what the future holds for the Michigan hitmaker, he said “moving in silence is my best trait…. We got some big things planned for the future” and left it at that. After speaking briefly with Caden Burks the CEO of Too Turnt Empire it is very possible we may see YNGThePlug added to the TTE roster. As Burks stated “We love how versatile this artist is…he is very unique, and also has the positive outlook on music we look for in artist.” With hardships in the past transferring from school to school and eventually dropping out things are finally starting to look bright for Dominique’s future. Hit singles like Often, Stay With Me, Head Gone, and Bad Times have earned YNGThePlug the respect and attention he deserves even ranking him amongst Michigans hottest artist.\nYNGThePlug not only has a unique flow but also a message that expresses freedom, liberation, and happiness. YNG puts a lot of emphasis on being very young minded and free spirited which sets him apart mentally from your typical artist. With the versatility, spirit, and drive YNGThePlug posses its not a question of if, but only when this artist will kick down the door of the industry.\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

I’m not afraid to take risks and challenge the norms. That’s what makes my music so powerful and so relatable.”\nA Message to the Youth\nAs Jahkidd continues to make waves in the music industry, he has a message for the youth: “Don’t be afraid to be yourself. Don’t be afraid to challenge the system and speak your truth.

        "title": "SpaceyMusic.com Just Launched, and It’s Redefining the Way Artists Buy Beats",
        "description": "\nIn an industry where producers and artists are constantly looking for ways to connect and monetize their work, a new platform is changing the game.SpaceyMusic.com, the brainchild of hip-hop producer Spacey, has officially launched, positioning itself as the industry’s first subscription-based beat marketplace.\nWith a resume that includes production credits for The Game, Wale, Mozzy, OT Genasis, Boosie, Dom Kennedy, and more, Spacey has already made a name for himself in the studio. Now, he’s expanding beyond producing hits and stepping into the business side of music, providing a platform that could revolutionize how beats are bought, sold, and discovered.\nThe site, which went live this week, already boasts a significant presence, with thousands of users actively engaging in the marketplace. Before the official launch, hundreds of producers and artists were on the waitlist, a sign of the growing demand for a modern and community-driven beat-selling ecosystem.\nTraditionally, artists purchase beats individually, either leasing them with restrictions or paying a premium for exclusive rights. SpaceyMusic.com shifts this model by introducing a subscription-based system, allowing artists to subscribe to their favorite producers and gain continuous access to their latest work.\nThe approach benefits both sides. Artists no longer have to navigate confusing licensing agreements for each purchase, while producers receive a steady revenue stream rather than relying on sporadic one-time sales. The subscription model mirrors the structure of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, but this time, it’s tailored for the beat-selling industry.\nBeyond just transactions, the site offers a full music production ecosystem, allowing producers to upload beats, manage licensing, communicate with customers, and track analytics all in one place. It also provides real-time data on beat performance, customer behavior, and revenue streams, helping producers make informed business decisions.\nUnlike traditional beat stores, where beats are simply listed for sale, SpaceyMusic.com introduces interactive elements that encourage community engagement. One standout feature is the Trending Playlists, which highlight the most popular beats within the platform. These playlists allow artists to easily discover the sounds gaining traction, and producers benefit from increased visibility.\nCurrent trending sections include a West Coast Trending Playlist and an SB Polo Beats Playlist, reflecting the tastes and preferences of users in real-time. The platform also features a Producer of the Week section, which spotlights standout talent, offering additional exposure for rising producers.\nAnother key feature is direct communication between producers and artists. Spacey himself has built a reputation for being accessible, responding to messages from artists looking to collaborate. That level of engagement is now embedded into the platform, making it more than just a transaction-based marketplace—it’s a hub where meaningful connections happen.\nFor Spacey, this move represents more than just a business venture—it’s a natural evolution. While he has spent years crafting beats for top-tier artists, SpaceyMusic.com positions him as an innovator, someone who understands not just how to make hits, but how to build infrastructure that benefits independent artists and producers alike.\nHis previous website,Spacey.com, was already a go-to source for artists looking to purchase his beats. But this new platform expands that vision, creating a space where multiple producers can thrive under one roof. In an industry where producers often struggle with monetization, Spacey’s model offers a more sustainable approach that could have long-term implications for how beat selling works.\nWith its official launch generating immediate buzz, the future of SpaceyMusic.com looks promising. The platform is already seeing significant engagement, and with Spacey and his team continuously adding new features, it could grow into one of the most important tools for producers and independent artists.\nPotential expansions could include exclusive partnerships with major artists and labels, enhanced collaboration tools, and further integrations with streaming services. But for now, SpaceyMusic.com has already disrupted the traditional beat marketplace, offering something that is not only fresh and modern but deeply rooted in the needs of today’s artists and producers.\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

At the age of 32, she uprooted herself and her children and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to pursue her career as a female writer and rapper. Cherry Pop’s love for music began early as a child growing up in church. She said she hid rapping because it was frowned upon in her household. So, she began secretly writing raps at the age of 12.

        "title": "Amir Ali’s Silent Rise Culminates in His Debut Album High Street",
        "description": "In a world where clout often overshadows craft, Amir Ali’s journey is refreshingly different. He has quietly carved out his place in the city’s hip-hop lineage, building momentum through a string of powerful singles and collaborations before finally unveiling his long-anticipated debut album, High Street, Today, April 8, 2025.\n\nBefore High Street, Amir Ali had already turned heads with sharp verses on tracks like “Duck,” “Nobody’s Coming to Save You, “Lost Souls” with Ki From Jerome, “Somebody F’d Up” alongside Dappa and FakeFreeKP and “Spilled Milk.” Every feature, every bar, every solo drop was a breadcrumb leading to something bigger—a sonic storm brewing in silence.\nNow that storm has arrived.\nWith High Street, Amir Ali delivers his most complete and personal statement to date. This is championship music—crafted over a span of more than 10 years, rooted in real life. Losses, triumphs, introspection, and unapologetic honesty shape every word and beat. It’s a coming-of-age journey that doesn’t shy away from pain—it bleeds with it. And it’s in that vulnerability that Amir becomes more than just a rapper—he becomes a voice for the everyday person trying to survive and evolve.\n\nProduction throughout the album is handled by the incredibly gifted JaySaif, whose sonic backdrops allow Amir’s bars to breathe, build, and break down walls. The features are intentional and powerful, spotlighting local heavy-hitters like Lihtz, Kur, Ki From Jerome and OT The Real, among others who add dimension without stealing focus.\nStandout tracks like “Sorry Not Sorry” (which Amir calls his “theme song”), “Champions” featuring Lihtz, “Either Way You Put It,” and “Please Don’t Feed the Wolves” set the tone. But it’s on “Therapy” where Amir reaches peak vulnerability—having a conversation with himself, channeled through the voice of a lost loved one. This isn’t just music. It’s healing. It’s memory. It’s real. And it’s the type of moment that elevates High Street from a solid debut to a timeless one.\nBeyond the music, Amir Ali’s impact is already being felt in the city and beyond. He’s earned co-signs from Philadelphia legends like Freeway,Beanie Sigel,Black Thought, among others, not through gimmicks but through authenticity. His fanbase is as organic as his process—real people connecting with real stories.\nAmir Ali is stepping into his role as the city’s next torchbearer. High Street isn’t just a debut—it’s a statement of identity. A bar-for-bar chronicle of growth, grief, and greatness. Amir Ali has arrived, and he’s here to stay.\n\n© 2025,Siani Leigh.

        "title": "“State N#mbers” – a latest release by The Lifers Group",
        "description": "\nThe Lifers Group, the collective of incarcerated individuals serving life sentences without the possibility of parole, gained national attention in 1992 with the release of “Belly of the Beast.” “Belly of the Beast” was also nominated the same year for Best Long Form Video. This project became a landmark in both prison art and activism, providing a powerful, unfiltered look at the emotional and psychological toll of life imprisonment. It highlighted the voices of individuals who had been sentenced to life without parole, challenging the public perception of these individuals as “beyond redemption.” Now, the Lifers Group is coming out with a new project titled “State N#mbers”, which promises to further explore the deep issues surrounding mass incarceration and the systemic dehumanization of those imprisoned.\nWhere “Belly of the Beast” focused on personal narratives of pain, regret, and the daily struggles of life in prison, “State N#mbers” shifts its lens to a broader social critique, underscoring the way the prison system reduces individuals to mere numbers—stripping them of their identities and humanity. The title itself, “State N#mbers”, refers to the identification numbers assigned to prisoners, a stark symbol of how they are dehumanized by the system. This new project, much like its predecessor, will continue to use creative expression—through music, art, and personal stories—to confront the injustices of the criminal justice system, while also addressing the broader impacts of mass incarceration on communities and families.\n“State N#mbers” aims to broaden the conversation, not just focusing on those sentenced to life, but examining the way the entire prison system operates as a dehumanizing force. Inmates are often seen not as people capable of growth and transformation, but as statistical units, their worth measured only by their crimes and sentences. The Lifers Group, through “State N#mbers”, seeks to challenge this narrative, showcasing how individuals can grow, change, and contribute to society, even while behind bars.\nThe project also serves as a critical examination of the ways in which the prison-industrial complex perpetuates inequality. Through the stories and voices of those involved in the Lifers Group, “State N#mbers” will likely highlight the ways in which racial, economic, and social factors intersect to shape who ends up behind bars—and who stays there for life.\nAs with “Belly of the Beast”, “State N#umbers” will provide an opportunity for viewers and listeners to see beyond the prison walls and witness the complexity of the individuals within them. The project is sure to push the boundaries of prison art once again, advocating for justice reform, giving voice to the incarcerated, and challenging the often one-dimensional views of those in the prison system. Through “State N#mbers”, the Lifers Group continues its ongoing mission to fight for dignity, humanity, and second chances, pushing for a reconsideration of life sentences and the larger implications of a punitive justice system.\nListen Here :\nhttps://vyd.co/StateNumber\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "title": "Merkekill Woodz: The Rising Rock Star Who Blends Metal, Hip-Hop, and Raw Emotion",
        "description": "Music has always been a vessel for creativity and expression, and for Merkekill Woodz, it’s no different. This 25-year-old Seattle-based rock artist has been making waves with his unique fusion of rock, heavy metal, and hip-hop. With a journey that started at a young age and a passion that’s only grown, Merkekill Woodz is gearing up to take the music industry by storm.\nBorn and raised in Seattle, Merkekill Woodz’s connection to music started early. “I used to watch rock interviews as a kid and I thought those were cool,” he says. But his real musical journey began when he was around 8 or 9 years old, producing beats with his now-deceased cousin. It wasn’t just a hobby—it was a way to connect, learn, and start honing his craft.\nWhile many artists find inspiration from their immediate environment or personal experiences, Merkekill Woodz was drawn to the art of making music after watching interviews with rock legends on MTV. Those moments sparked something in him that he would later turn into a career. He didn’t just want to be a spectator—he wanted to be a part of it, and that’s when he began laying the groundwork for his musical future.\nWhen it comes to describing his music, Merkekill Woodz doesn’t follow the typical genre rules. Instead, he creates a sound that is all his own—a raw blend of rock, heavy metal, and hip-hop. His music is gritty, emotional, and full of intensity, making it clear that his sound is driven by how he feels at any given time.\n“The way my brain works is odd, but my creative process typically deals with how I’m feeling at the time,” Merkekill shares. He doesn’t approach music creation with fame in mind; rather, it’s about authentic expression. For him, it’s all about channeling emotion and delivering it with raw intensity. As he jokingly puts it, “I try and record with my dick and balls,” adding that his music is deeply connected to his personal energy and mindset.\nHis unique approach to blending genres is part of what sets Merkekill Woodz apart from the mainstream rock scene. It’s not about fitting into a pre-defined box; it’s about experimenting and creating something true to his own vision.\nMerkekill Woodz might be a newcomer to the recording scene—he only started recording music in the summer of 2023—but his experience goes beyond the mic. He has contributed to art and music for well-known figures such as XXXTentacion and Jay-Z, showcasing his versatility as a producer and contributor. Despite the many talented people in the industry, Merkekill says he’s open to collaboration but is selective. He appreciates the depth of experience and artistry others bring, but his focus remains on creating authentic, personal music.\nWhen asked who he’d most like to collaborate with, Merkekill names Beyoncé. “That’s a hard question because everyone is so good now,” he says, acknowledging the depth of talent in the industry. But his dream to collaborate with Beyoncé speaks to his desire to work with the best, pushing his limits and expanding his artistic horizons.\nMerkekill Woodz’s views on the music industry are as unapologetic as his sound. “The internet is trash and doesn’t help with anything,” he says. He expresses frustration with the surveillance and lack of fairness that many artists face. However, despite these challenges, Merkekill believes that his art is valued by his fans. “People care about my art as much as I do, so I should probably start caring more,” he admits. This reflects his personal growth and the realization that his music does have an impact—and it’s time for him to take that impact more seriously.\nMerkekill has also been influenced by some of the greatest musicians of all time. His admiration for Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, James Brown, AC/DC, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin shows the breadth of his musical inspirations. These legends shaped the soundscape Merkekill is working to create today, combining his love for rock and hip-hop with his own unique twist.\nWhen he’s not working on his music, Merkekill Woodz admits that his life could have taken a different path. “If it wasn’t for my music career, I’d probably be trapping or selling drugs or guns,” he confesses. His past was filled with obstacles, but music became his way out, his escape from potential paths that weren’t so positive.\nDespite these challenges, Merkekill’s resilience has carried him forward. Today, he enjoys a life in music and remains focused on his next steps. “Less is more” is the advice that’s guided him through the years, reminding him to focus on what really matters and to keep things simple.\nLooking ahead, Merkekill Woodz is planning to drop another album later this year. He says, “We’ll see how I’m feeling,” keeping his fans on edge as they await new music. But no matter what, Merkekill’s goal remains the same: to make art that’s true to himself, without the pressure to fit into anyone else’s expectations.\nMerkekill Woodz is still in the early stages of his career, but his potential is undeniable. His music speaks to a generation looking for authenticity and passion in their artists. With his unique blend of rock, heavy metal, and hip-hop, Merkekill is carving his own path in the music world, and there’s no telling how far he’ll go.\nStay connected with Merkekill Woodz and check out his latest work:\nMerkekill Woodz is more than just a musician—he’s a force to be reckoned with. His journey from producing beats with his late cousin to creating his own sound in the music industry reflects resilience, creativity, and a refusal to conform. With a sound that blends rock, heavy metal, and hip-hop, Merkekill is making waves and leaving his mark on the industry. Keep an eye on this rising star—he’s just getting started.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "Constileon Nassir Brady: A Journey of Passion, Resilience, and Triumph",
        "description": "\nwritten by dank\nIn the heart of Upland and San Bernardino, a young boy with a dream was born—Constileon Nassir Brady. From an early age, his world revolved around music, drawn in by the timeless melodies of legends like Michael Jackson and the simple joy of playing with music toys. What began as childhood fascination soon evolved into an unshakable calling, a path illuminated by passion, perseverance, and an unrelenting belief in his artistry.\nThe Making of an Artist\nConstileon’s approach to music is deeply personal. He doesn’t chase trends or try to fit a mold. Instead, he focuses on creating what feels right—music that is fun, meaningful, and capable of touching lives. “I just want to make music and be successful,” he says, a simple yet powerful mantra that fuels his every step.\nHis journey has been marked by key milestones—joining a high school choir, stepping into professional studios, and collaborating with artists like Dank and Musik. Each of these moments reinforced his belief that he was on the right path. Performing on stage for the first time alone was another turning point—proof that he was ready to carve out his own place in the industry.\nOvercoming the Noise\nLike many artists, Constileon has faced his share of challenges. Doubters, negativity, and the pressures of an industry that often demands conformity could have easily discouraged him. But instead of succumbing to the weight of criticism, he found strength in the stories of those who came before him. Documentaries, tour vlogs, and movies about artists who overcame their struggles became his blueprint for resilience.\n“I just kept my focus on music,” he explains. “I knew that if I stayed locked in on my vision, no amount of negativity could stop me.”\nA Message to Dreamers\nFor those who support him and for anyone chasing a dream, Constileon offers words of encouragement:\n“Keep your mind focused on one thing through every obstacle. Dream it, say it, believe it. Eventually, something from your energy will take shape, and you’ll have what you asked for. But the real question is—will you be ready for it?”\nThis philosophy isn’t just something he preaches; it’s the foundation of his career. Every new song, every studio session, and every performance is a testament to his unwavering belief in himself and his destiny.\nBuilding a Legacy Through his independent record label, Chosen By The Ones 1’s Record Label, Constileon is not just making music—he’s creating a movement. His mission is to inspire others to express themselves through music, to use art as an outlet for emotions instead of letting them fester. He envisions a future where his success becomes a beacon for others, proving that with dedication, talent, and faith, anything is possible.\nHis goals are clear: sign with a major label, win a Grammy, and become one of the biggest stars the industry has ever seen. More than just accolades, he wants his music to resonate, to be loved and supported by fans who find pieces of their own stories in his songs.\nThe Road Ahead\nConstileon’s journey is far from over—it’s only just beginning. With projects like Ocean Heart / Sandy Beach and ongoing collaborations pushing him further into the spotlight, he continues to evolve, refine his craft, and prepare for the moment when the world fully takes notice.\nAnd when that moment comes, one thing is certain: he’ll be ready.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

This process involves manifesting a vision over a lifetime, encountering significant challenges, exercising perseverance, and making substantial sacrifices. It requires an unwavering commitment to one’s craft, alongside self-compassion during difficult times, and a disciplined approach to turn aspirations into reality. Essential to this journey is the ability to envision long-term goals while overcoming present obstacles.\nIn this regard, dreaming serves as a valuable mental escape, providing a refuge from daily routines.

Additionally, it has generated a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to impact global culture significantly.

        "description": "\nIn a time when clout often outweighs content and viral moments eclipse vulnerability, Arshae is breaking the mold—one raw lyric at a time. With songs that hit harder than most confessionals and a pen guided by real-life pain, growth, and survival, she’s proving that authenticity isn’t dead—it’s just been waiting for a voice like hers.\nBTB ( Been That)\n\nNo Filters, Just Facts\nArshae’s music isn’t polished for perfection—it’s real, it’s raw, and it cuts deep. Her tracks play like audio diaries, unpacking secrets, heartbreak, resilience, and rebirth. In Secrets, she dives into the often-hidden truths within families. In Confusion, she explores the chaos of modern love and relationships. And in BTB—a bold wake-up call—she lays it all on the line for any man who dares to play with her emotions.\nEach track isn’t just a song—it’s a chapter in her story.\n“I believe my lyrics and storytelling are what make me so authentic,” Arshae shares. “Every word is from the heart. I’m not just rapping—I’m revealing.”\nA Survivor’s Voice\nArshae’s journey hasn’t been easy. Her upcoming project, Black Rose, set to release this May, offers the most intimate look into her life yet. It’s more than music—it’s a declaration of survival.\n“Before I started chasing my dreams, I was so depressed. I felt I had no purpose here,” she admits. “I say I survived suicide because I lived through both attempts.”\nIt’s heavy. It’s real. And it’s exactly what makes Black Rose so meaningful. The black rose itself symbolizes mourning and rebirth, but also resilience and new beginnings—everything Arshae embodies. During her darkest times, music became her light. She took the pain, the confusion, the hopelessness, and turned it into fuel.\n“I kept having these dreams—rapping in front of huge crowds. So I decided to fight for that. To fight for me.”\nVisuals That Speak Louder Than Words\nBut Arshae isn’t stopping with just the music. As someone who also loves to act, she’s crafting visuals that tell stories just as powerfully as her lyrics. Her goal? To turn every music video into a short film—an extension of the emotion behind the beat. Whether it’s heartbreak, healing, or hustle, Arshae makes sure her audience feels it.\nKeeping Hip-Hop Honest\nIn a genre often clouded by bravado, Arshae is a reminder of hip-hop’s roots: storytelling, truth, and connection. She’s not trying to fit in—she’s here to stand out. And with every verse, she reclaims the space for real stories and raw emotions.\nIf you’re looking for surface-level bops, you won’t find them here. But if you’re ready for music that moves you—music that matters—Arshae is that voice.\nBecause real can’t be faked. And Arshae? She’s as real as it gets.\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

Big Jon is on a mission to bring back the soul of hip-hop and honor the roots that shaped him.\nThe Spark That Lit the Flame\nBig Jon’s love affair with hip-hop began in 2005 at the age of 12, just as he stepped into the world of middle school. Raised on legends like Tupac, Biggie Smalls, Eminem, Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, and 50 Cent, he found not just entertainment, but a sense of identity and inspiration. By 16, the beats and bars weren’t just playing in his headphones—they were coming from his own pen. Freestyling over beats from Drake, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj, Big Jon began honing his craft with performances at school and church, where his lyrical talent and soulful delivery left audiences in awe.\nHis musical journey didn’t begin and end with rap—his vocal roots run deep. As a child, he led his church choir, infusing gospel energy and emotional resonance into his performances. This early training set the foundation for his dynamic fusion of singing and rapping, a blend that continues to define his unique style.\nThe Detour That Reinforced the Dream\nAfter graduating high school, Big Jon put music on hold to focus on education, enrolling at Towson University where he majored in media production and graduated in 2019 with a 3.5 GPA. He pursued a broadcasting career with the same determination he once gave to songwriting—but after five years in the field and a growing sense of unfulfillment, his heart pulled him back to his first love: music.\nIn the summer of 2024, the fire was reignited. With renewed vision and personal growth, he poured himself into writing, recording, and shaping a debut EP that marks a bold statement of return.\n“HERE I COME”: A Testament to Resilience\nBig Jon’s debut EP “HERE I COME” is more than just a title—it’s a declaration. The six-track project includes Rise Again, Sponsor, Spirits, Powers, No More, and Don’t Judge Me, all written by Big Jon himself. With production handled by SongBuilder Studios in Baltimore and Lounge Studios in NYC (for the standout track “Powers”), the EP showcases his lyrical depth, vocal control, and storytelling ability.\nEach track dives into personal and universal themes—from spiritual battles and personal growth to grief and judgment—all delivered with raw authenticity. These aren’t just songs. They’re confessions, conversations, and calls to action.\nBehind the bars and melodies lies a deeper purpose. Big Jon’s mother, a constant source of love and support, passed away in 2021 from pancreatic cancer. Her memory fuels every verse, every hook, every studio session. Creating music now isn’t just about artistic expression—it’s about making her proud and using his voice to touch others who are navigating loss, struggle, or searching for hope.\nBig Jon isn’t chasing trends. He’s crafting timeless art. He stands for lyrical quality, musicality, and substance in a space that too often rewards flash over foundation.\nWith the release of “HERE I COME,” Big Jon is carving out his own space in the industry—one driven by passion, purpose, and authenticity. Whether you’re a longtime hip-hop head or a new listener hungry for meaning in music, Big Jon’s journey is one worth following.\nSo if you’re looking for music that speaks, heals, and uplifts—get ready. Big Jon is coming\nFollow Big Jon’s journey and stay tuned for updates, performances, and releases. This is just the beginningg\nSocial Media Links:https://www.instagram.com/thetruebigionhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thetruebigionhttps://music.apple.com/us/artist/big-jonhttps://x.com/BigJon4ever\n\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "title": "A Kodak Kid Building His Own Sound: The Kidd Called Quest Story",
        "description": "\nIn the heart of Rochester, New York, where snowy winters and gritty streets paint a vivid backdrop, a sonic craftsman has been quietly building a legacy rooted in authenticity and soul. That architect is none other thanKidd Called Quest, a producer whose journey through hip-hop is defined by passion, perseverance, and an unshakable love for the craft.\nHis story starts in the late ’90s—a golden era for hip-hop, when raw lyricism and soulful beats ruled the underground. At just 10 years old, Kidd Called Quest (real name undisclosed) found himself pulled into the culture, thanks to his older brother, a DJ spinning records every Thursday night on the University of Rochester’s 88.5 FM. Another major influence came in the form ofDJ Chris Gand his legendaryStraight From The Undergroundshow on 89.7 FM. Between his brother’s crates and Chris G’s mixtapes, Kidd Called Quest was absorbing the best of hip-hop before he even realized he would one day create it himself.\nAt first, producing was just a curiosity. But over time, fueled by encouragement from friends, recognition from peers, and the fire lit by legendary producers likeRZA,Hi-Tek,DJ Premier,Alchemist,Da BeatminerzandDJ SHOK, Quest began shaping his own sound. A pivotal moment came when his friendDevineintroduced him to theMPC 2000—a tool that transformed beats in his head into tangible works of art. From that point forward, music wasn’t just a pastime; it became hispurpose.\n\nLike many on the come-up, the road wasn’t easy. Rejection emails, unanswered messages, and moments of self-doubt haunted the early chapters. But rather than quit, Quest doubled down. He attended theiStandard Producer Showcases, founded by the lateJ. Hatch, where he networked, built confidence, and grew his brand. One of his biggest moments came when legendary emceeKool G Raplaid bars over one of his beats—a full-circle moment that reminded him just how far he had come.\nHis collaboration withPretty Bullion her acclaimed albumThen and Nowwas another high point. The project, hailed for its classic boom-bap essence and Bulli’s razor-sharp lyricism, caught the attention of major outlets and reaffirmed Quest’s place as a champion ofreal hip-hop. For Quest, the essence of his sound lies in digging through vinyl, chopping samples, and constructing beats that feel both timeless and current.\n“Preserving the art of beat-making is important to me,” he says. “I want to honor the roots of hip-hop while pushing it forward.”\nLooking ahead to 2025, Kidd Called Quest is showing no signs of slowing down. He’s currently cooking up new material with artists likeTito Lopez,Curtis Coke,2100 Bagz, andAzariahfor a fresh release underYoung Black and Gifted. There are also instrumental tapes, compilation albums, and unreleased gems waiting in the wings.\nDespite his deep catalog, Quest doesn’t consider himself a mentor—but that hasn’t stopped him from guiding younger artists through the game’s trials. Whether it’s helping them navigate music distribution, understanding contracts, or just offering an ear, Quest is all about sharing wisdom while continuing to evolve.\nThough he never formally trained as a musician, Kidd Called Quest’s understanding of music comes from an organic place—where technology and soul collide. On stage, he’s in his element, feeding off crowd energy and turning shows into communal experiences. His creative process is old-school in spirit but forward-thinking in execution.\nHis motto?Stay humble. Work hard. Never quit. Be yourself.It’s this mantra—and his dedication to originality—that keeps him grounded while the world catches on.\nIf you’re looking for a producer who embodies the spirit of real hip-hop, look no further than Kidd Called Quest. His catalog is a testament to the power of grit, growth, and the golden sound of vinyl drums under soulful loops.\n\nCheck out Kidd Called Quest’s work:Bandcamp\n\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "description": "\nWhen it comes to paying homage to the greats while representing your own block, few artists do it as unapologetically asChicago’s De-fense. The Southside spitter just dropped a razor-sharp remix of Nas’s classic “NY State of Mind,” flipping the legendary Queensbridge anthem into a gritty, soulful ode to his own stomping grounds—“Chicago State of Mind.”\nAnd trust—it hits different.\nDirected byRaw Ruler, a name already stamped into the Chi’s underground film game, the video is a raw visual diary of the city’s pulse. Shot across multiple neighborhoods—from boarded-up storefronts on the Southside to skyline views on the West, basketball courts, back alleys, and corner stores—the video doesn’t sugarcoat. It’s all texture, all truth. The lens moves like a documentary, but the bars? They float like poetry soaked in survival and soul.\nOver DJ Premier’s iconic boom-bap production, De-fense doesn’t just rap—he paints. His delivery is relentless but surgical, slicing through topics like systemic struggle, Black pride, gentrification, loyalty, and generational trauma. But it’s not all darkness—there’s light too. “Chicago State of Mind” is also a call to action, a love letter, and a battle cry for those grinding in the shadows of the skyline.\n“I ain’t just rappingatthe city, I’m rappingforit,” De-fense said in a recent IG Live. “This ain’t no remix, this isrebirth.”\nThe joint already has heads buzzing across the Midwest, getting spins on college radio and reposts from hip-hop tastemakers tapped into the street circuit. And with Raw Ruler’s eye behind the lens, every frame feels iconic. No fancy cars. No filters. Just bars and brickwork.\nFor De-fense, “Chicago State of Mind” isn’t a moment—it’s a mission. And judging from the energy in the comments and the reposts flying around the city, he just turned a classic into a Chi-town cornerstone.\nThe message is clear: Chicago’s De-fense isn’t just repping the city—heisthe city.\nWatch the official “Chicago State of Mind” video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUMmIvZ7v-8\nFollow @Chicagos_defense and @rawruler for more upcoming visuals and behind-the-scenes heat.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nJesse Is Heavyweight has been the influence behind billions of dollars in revenue. As a result of that and Jesse’s DTC business model some major labels are placing their bets on the Texas CEO.\nMajor labels are buying Indy companies, partnering with digital distribution platforms and buying companies that offer tools to help Indy acts.

It’s no surprise labels have set their sights on Founder and Rap Artist Jesse Is Heavyweight and his unicorn Heavyweight Unlimited.\nJesse’s company Heavyweight Unlimited has been involved in a high powered bidding war with Yahoo Finance reporting the offers reached around the 8 figure mark. This means that Jesse has been offered anywhere from $10 million to $99 million from more than one major company. Recently Def Jam signed Gelo for a reported $13 million. Logic’s deal was reported at $30 million making 8 figures around exactly where an artist like Jesse Is Heavyweight’s deal is worth.\nIn the latest, one of the bidding companies has included an executive role where Jesse will hold a President title to entice him to accept the terms of the deal. This new development could be the tipping point.\n\nWhat’s so special about Jesse Is Heavyweight? Jesse Is Heavyweight is talented. Really talented. And he is a savant.

        "title": "Meet The Activation King and Hip-Hop Visionary Driving the Culture Forward Dren Starr",
        "description": "\nDren Starr’s name has resonated throughout New York’s hip-hop scene for years—and with good reason. Hailing from Manhattan’s Lower East Side, this Puerto Rican DJ, entrepreneur, and branding expert has spent decades influencing the very culture he was raised in. Growing up in the LaGuardia housing projects, Starr discovered a deep connection to music early on, especially following the heartbreaking loss of his father. Supported by his mother and older sister, music quickly became both a sanctuary and a calling.\nAt just 14, Dren was already working the turntables at local parties. By 18, he launched 91.9 FM WBAD, a pirate radio station that disrupted New York’s radio landscape and earned him a feature on UPN9 News. He wasn’t merely spinning records—he was introducing new talent and championing the underground hip-hop that mainstream stations often overlooked.\n“My passion for music was clear from the start,” Starr recalls. “Once I got my first turntables, everything shifted. I began DJing local events and quickly gained recognition in my neighborhood. I wasn’t just spinning records—I was building experiences.”\n\nA major milestone came when he became the youngest DJ ever to be featured on Channel 9 News, thanks to his groundbreaking work with WBAD. While others followed trends, Starr forged his own path—proving that hip-hop didn’t need mainstream radio validation to make waves. All it required was a signal, a microphone, and raw energy.\nHowever, his journey wasn’t without obstacles. Between 2010 and 2016, Starr served a prison sentence. Upon his return, the music landscape had transformed. The rise of streaming and digital platforms had taken over. Rather than resist the changes, he adapted—launching L.E.S. Brand and embracing digital innovation while staying loyal to his roots.\nStarr’s lasting impact in the industry boils down to three core values: authenticity, timing, and consistency. Remaining genuine helped him earn long-term respect. Taking timely risks—like starting pirate radio when it counted—kept him ahead of the curve. And being consistent ensured his relevance, even as music and media evolved. He’s collaborated with legends like Big Pun and Ghostface Killah and worked with major brands like Roc Nation and D’USSÉ. Though deeply connected, his focus has always remained on uplifting community and culture.\nThese days, Dren is expanding his influence through theD’USSÉ Lounge Podcast, where he leads raw, unfiltered discussions about hip-hop, business, and life. As a D’USSÉ brand ambassador, he’s also curating exclusive events that blend music and marketing, continuing to honor the culture in authentic ways.\nFrom spinning at local parties to running pirate radio, to forming high-profile brand collaborations, Dren Starr’s story proves that staying grounded while evolving with the times is the key to lasting success. He’s not just building a legacy—he’s living it, and opening doors for the next generation. To keep up with Dren Starr, follow him on Instagram@DRENSTARRor visitDRENSTARR.COM.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

Hailing from Arkansas, he brings a rare mix of vulnerability, sharp lyricism, and commanding production. After rebranding in late 2023 and stepping away from his former moniker YB, BEEZY entered a new chapter—one rooted in reinvention, self-mastery, and full creative control. Now producing his own music, his sound is more focused than ever: heavy 808s, sleek atmospheres, and stories that cut deep.\nHis new EP, 4 SUCH A TIME AS THIS, captures that evolution in full force. The project opens with “GATEKEEP!”—an urgent, horn-laced anthem that kicks the door open with fire and conviction. It sets the tone for a record that’s both triumphant and intentional. “STILL 30 FOR 30” follows, channeling the grit of classic Southern rap through a modern lens, with BEEZY’s delivery slicing through a dark, moody beat.\n“BEEN THROUGH” flips the vibe, weaving soul samples and raw drums into a hypnotic groove that highlights his knack for introspective, quotable songwriting. Then there’s “THE BLOOD,” the emotional centerpiece and closer—equal parts reflection and celebration, delivered with passion and purpose.\nOverall, each track carries its own weight, but together they tell a story: of resilience, growth, and a refusal to be boxed in.

        "title": "Torre Lott: From Cleveland’s Underground to Hip-Hop’s Outer Limits",
        "description": "\nWhen you talk about hip-hop’s next wave of innovators, Torre Lott is a name that deserves a seat at the table. Repping the west side of Cleveland with an ear for the avant-garde and a heart rooted in real-life struggle, Torre is proof that you don’t have to chase trends to stand out—you just have to speak your truth.\nHis music blends street storytelling with something deeper: a kind of emotional honesty that cuts through the noise. Tracks like Reflections—his breakout single spotlighted by Kevin Abstract of BROCKHAMPTON—showcase that duality. The beat hits, the lyrics sting, but it’s the vulnerability that sticks with you.\nTorre came up classically trained, learning from a young age how to interpret and perform complete musical works with discipline and soul. That early education gave him tools most rappers don’t have—an ear for arrangement, dynamics, and storytelling. And it shows. Whether he’s drawing from metal, classical, or traditional hip-hop, every track he drops has a purpose and a pulse.\nOne of his most celebrated releases so far is the EP Reason One: The Rising Sun, a thoughtful and immersive project made with longtime collaborator Rex Schirra. The EP plays like a sunrise for the soul—bright, haunting, and real. It’s not designed for radio rotation; it’s built for listeners who actually listen.\nTorre’s been grinding mostly behind the scenes, building relationships, staying sharp, and studying the game from the inside. He hasn’t needed major cosigns to gain traction—just consistent output, word of mouth, and a sound that refuses to blend in. He’s shared rooms with some of the same artists who sparked his creative fire years ago. But he’s never been interested in clout-chasing. For Torre, the interaction is the currency. He’s not just trying to work with people—he’s trying to connect.\nWith 2025 underway, Torre’s setting the tone for the year with a string of new singles and visual content that’ll keep fans on their toes. There’s also at least one new project on the way, but don’t expect any formulas—he’s never been about that. Each drop is its own world.\n“The music’s one thing,” Torre says, “but what I care about most is that people feel it—like it speaks to something inside them.”\nFrom Cleveland basements to the global stage, Torre Lott is building his legacy brick by brick. No gimmicks. No shortcuts. Just real artistry and real impact.\nListen to Reflections:https://open.spotify.com/track/4DM9jloJ3V9pYk881u6IJ6?si=2OovqkI8QT6XpSWBur73Pg\nFollow him on Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/torrelott?igsh=dTB5NnJ6MDljdDRz\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

Women bear the immense weight of societal expectations and injustices on their shoulders every single moment of their existence.

Time, often regarded as the most precious and fleeting resource in our lives, eludes our grasp despite our best efforts. No matter how much wealth or power one accumulates, it is an undeniable truth that neither can afford the luxury of additional time.\nWhen individuals come to realize the profound significance of time, it sparks a moment of clarity and contemplation, inviting a sense of serenity that permeates the mind and spirit. To truly reach the heights of their God-given abilities, one must embrace each passing second with purpose and intention, infusing their daily lives with passion and determination.\nRegrettably, life does not offer second chances to reclaim lost time; each moment is a unique opportunity, a fleeting chance that will never return.

        "description": "\nIn a culture where the line between clout and credibility is often blurred,Six Da Prophetstands as a rare and refreshing voice of authenticity. BornAnthony LaminRock Island, Illinois, and raised in the concrete reality ofNorth Minneapolis, his life is the embodiment of pain turned into purpose, survival turned into strategy, and talent turned into timeless impact.\nThe nameLamcarries weight in theMidwest—especially in places likeSt. Louis, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Minnesota, where the family’s musical legacy is known and respected. “Some may say it’s royalty,” Six says with a smile. It’s not just a name—it’s a lineage. A musical dynasty that influenced Six before he even knew what a studio was.\n“I looked up to my uncles and aunts who all did music. Which made me want to be an artist too,” he reflects. “All I knew was the streets and music.” That combination of raw environment and creative inspiration lit a fire in him early. At just15 years old, Six released his first album,The Seven Seals, which made waves across Minneapolis, earning him a spot in local newspapers and stages across the city. His performances were more than hype—they were filled with urgency and realness, so much so that he was invited to perform for the late SenatorPaul Wellstone, a rare honor for a young Black artist from the trenches.\nFrom there, his grind only intensified. A respected member of thelegendary Mackilot Dead N Gone (MDG)collective, Six sharpened his skills in every lane possible—from studio albums to rap battles. His rise wasn’t overnight. It was built with discipline and vision, and now, as aCEOof his own label,Northside Or Nothing Entertainment, Six has evolved from neighborhood pioneer to full-blown executive.\nSix recently locked in adistribution deal with Empire/GT Digital, adding another level of professionalism and reach to his movement. His younger brotherSlyce, a respected producer, writer, and artist in his own right, serves as both collaborator and family anchor. Together, they’re a powerful force driving authentic Midwest music into the national conversation.\nAnd the recognition is stacking up. In recent years, Six was crowned“Artist of the Decade”by theMinnesota Men’s Music Awards, and became the“First Champion”at theGrassroots National Music Seminar—proof that the streets, the industry, and the culture all recognize his greatness.\nBut this isn’t a victory lap—it’s the warmup. Six’s latest single,“Trap Mobile”, is the sound of an artist still hungry. The track is cinematic, heavy with bounce and grit, but even heavier with bars. It reflects the hustle and motion of trap life, but also the spiritual insight that comes from living both sides of the game. It’s Midwest at its core—raw, intentional, and addictive.\n📲 Tap into Six Da Prophet’s new single “Trap Mobile” now:🎧Apple Music🎥YouTube🎶Spotify\n© 2025,Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

From bass-house bangers that racked up100 million+ playsto rolling out a new era of brutal Hard Techno,DISTRXCTis still that name. No gimmicks. No industry fluff. Just straight domination.\nTheGabrovo (city ofBulgaria)-born producer-turned-powerhouse has been carrying theBulgarianEDM flag for years, and in 2025, he’s still waving it the loudest.

        "description": "At just 13,Shaddi Gstood under the lights, surrounded by a crowd way bigger than him, and delivered a performance that marked the start of something real. “I felt like an ant in a room full of elephants,” he says. “But that was the first time I felt like something was actually for me.”\nThat moment was the spark and he’s been pushing ever since.\nRaised in a household where artists like Boosie, Jeezy, and Yo Gotti were on constant rotation, music was always present. His mom was the first to recognize his talent and made sure he had access to studio time early on. That support helped Shaddi develop into an artist who’s not only confident on the mic but intentional with his sound.\nKnown for working with producers likeGLA,Rio Leyva, andJaeblow, Shaddi gravitates toward beats that push him creatively. “I look for sounds that hit different,” he explains. “Something that gives me energy.” That energy shows up in lines like“Kill a beat, bitch I’m Hip-Hop’s Charles Manson”—a bar he says flies under the radar unless you catch the reference.\nHe’s already built some major moments, including opening atPower 99’s Powerhousewith Meek Mill andLil Uzi Vert, and performing at Club Roar with Boosie—an especially meaningful show since his mom played Boosie heavy when he was growing up. “Backstage at Powerhouse, I just felt ready. It reminded me that I can take this further.”\nShaddi’s not the type to stay stuck online. He makes it a point to connect with people directly, sharing his story with fans navigating their own struggles. “A kid once DM’d me saying my music helped them through some personal stuff. That hit me. I didn’t realize it had that kind of reach.”\nBefore any show, his routine is simple: prayer, positive affirmations, water, and a Clif Bar. He’s not giving away too much yet, but confirms a new EP titledYENis dropping before summer—and he’s got some collaborations in the vault.\nAs for what’s next? The now 19-year-old says, “I want to lock in a major brand collab. And I’m aiming for a Rolling Loud stage in 2025.”\nFocused, self-aware, and on the right track, Shaddi G isn’t waiting for a moment. He’s building one.\n© 2025,Siani Leigh. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nBrace yourselves! Frqnzy, the dynamic artist celebrated for his timeless musicality and compelling artistry, is back and bringing the heat with his latest single, “Thing On Me.” This undeniable BOP boasts a West Coast-infused “Not Like Us” vibe that’s guaranteed to be the soundtrack to your summer.\nAdding an intriguing layer to this release, inside sources reveal that “Thing On Me” was actually recorded during the same prolific period that yielded Frqnzy’s breakthrough viral hit, “Victim” (released in 2018-2019, despite being recorded in 2013). This revelation underscores Frqnzy’s innate ability to craft music that remains ahead of its time. “Victim” itself left an indelible mark, dominating Shazam and Amazon charts and quickly amassing over 1 million streams within its initial two weeks. The track’s impact resonated with the legendary Krayzie Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, who not only endorsed the rising artist but also invited him to join both his solo and Bone Thugs tours during his West Coast run.\nRiding this momentum, Frqnzy dropped “I Won’t Deny It” during his tour, which gained significant traction on Los Angeles radio. The track further solidified his international appeal, charting at #2 in South Africa and #4 in the US in 2021. Following this success, Frqnzy delivered what many consider an independent classic, his album “Pure.” This 11-track project also achieved over 1 million streams within its release month, fueled by fan-favorite singles like “Imagination,” “If I Heart Break” (which charted at #4 in both Canada and the US), “Okay To Cry,” and “Rotation.” “Pure” unequivocally showcased Frqnzy’s versatility, seamlessly blending mainstream sensibilities with an authentic underground edge, earning him respect across both pop and hip-hop spheres. His distinct approach, marked by substance, tone, and a raw yet powerful delivery, sets him apart in a landscape often dominated by purely melodic trends.\nSince “Pure,” Frqnzy has continued to hone his craft, collaborating on tracks with emerging talents while simultaneously developing innovative side projects, most notably “Dakickback.” This ambitious social media platform aims to revolutionize online interaction by merging elements of Myspace and Facebook with integrated charts and streaming capabilities. While anticipation builds for more information on “Dakickback,” Frqnzy’s immediate focus is on his triumphant return to the music scene with “Thing On Me.”\n“Thing On Me” is more than just a song; it’s an undeniable vibe.

        "title": "Hybrid Collapse Releases Captivating New Album “Biopolitics”",
        "description": "\n\nHybrid Collapse is a boundary-blurring audiovisual AI project that fuses electronic music, generated visuals, and critical theory into a single immersive experience. The work is not merely an album or a series of videos — it’s a conceptual framework for navigating life in a world dominated by digital abstraction, biopolitical control, and posthuman aesthetics.\nThe debut album Biopolitics is a meticulously structured narrative told across ten tracks, each accompanied by a corresponding AI-crafted video. The music moves from ambient decay to glitch-infused industrial and dystopian pop, building a world where identity is no longer stable but perpetually reprogrammed. Themes of surveillance, sexuality, artificial embodiment, and algorithmic behavior are embedded into both the sonic and visual layers, creating a unified, confrontational aesthetic.\nWhat sets Hybrid Collapse apart is its integration of philosophical depth with striking cinematic style. The project draws on thinkers like Agamben, Haraway, and Baudrillard, translating abstract ideas into visceral, hyperreal sequences. Visually, the videos feature haunting figures — black-robed priestesses, synthetic lovers, faceless enforcers — all enacting rituals in bleak urban and ritualistic environments. Fire, oil, and shadows become symbols of sacrifice, transformation, and spiritual surrender to technological systems.\nUnlike many AI-driven art experiments, Hybrid Collapse isn’t about novelty — it’s about meaning. Artificial intelligence is not a tool here, but a voice within the system. It co-authors the collapse.\nBiopolitics is an act of resistance and a requiem — a refusal to submit quietly to digital hegemony, even while dressed in its skin. It is both warning and prophecy.\nConnect:\nhttps://www.hybridcollapse.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@HybridCollapse\nhttps://www.instagram.com/hybridcollapse/\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\nThe tension between internet personality Shamarco and rising R&B star Iam Shamar has officially spilled into music, as Shamarco recently teased a diss track via Instagram Stories—just hours after Iam Shamar made a public statement that he would not entertain negativity online.\nThe drama stems from Iam Shamar’s claim that Shamarco has been using a name and image uncomfortably close to his own, blurring lines between originality and imitation. Iam Shamar, known for his soulful sound and respected presence in the R&B scene, chose not to engage in a social media back-and-forth, stating he would address the situation “through the music.”\nShamarco’s diss track snippet, dropped shortly after that post, appears to be a direct response. But many fans are calling it what it looks like—an attempt to stir attention rather than offer clarity or accountability.\nWith a track record that includes collaborations with established names and performances on major stages, Iam Shamar isn’t new to the spotlight—and he’s not easily shaken. While he hasn’t released a response yet, sources close to the artist say he is expected to reply in his own time and on his own terms, through music.\nAnd if his past work is any indication, the response won’t just be loud—it’ll be undeniable.\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is certain: authenticity always speaks louder than imitation.\nListen to the diss track below\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/qaiz3BXgJZ84rNBJ6\n\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nBorn in Prince George’s County, Maryland, YOUNG S.H.O’s journey is as dynamic as his music. At just 10 years old, he relocated to Johnston, South Carolina, where he was embraced by a nurturing family that included his grandmother, aunts, and uncles. Though his passion for music burned from an early age, YOUNG S.H.O initially found success on the athletic field. He became a SC State 400-meter Gold medalist as a freshman at Strom Thurmond High School, setting an impressive record that still stands 21 years later—a testament to his determination and talent.\n\nInfluenced by a family background steeped in music, YOUNG S.H.O developed a deep love for hip-hop, taking inspiration from his relatives who sang solely at church. His early experiences in the choir at Rosa Spring Baptist Church helped shape his musical artistry, blending spiritual melodies with the rhythmic cadence of Southern hip-hop.\nAs YOUNG S.H.O’s musical career evolved, he collaborated with a range of notable artists, including MPA Band Camp, Peewee Longway, Sauce Walka, and Kid Kid from the Squad Up team, originally founded by Lil Wayne and later associated with G-Unit under 50 Cent. Additionally, he worked alongside Headkrack, a well-known radio personality featured on platforms like Dish Nation and the Ricky Smiley Show. These collaborations reflect his ambition to carve out a distinctive niche in the music industry.\nYOUNG S.H.O’s upcoming single, “Miami Nights,” set to drop on April 25th, is highly anticipated and reflects his ability to meld personal experiences with catchy beats. Not only is he building momentum through his music, but he also has an exciting show lined up on May 18th in Ontario, Canada, where he’ll perform alongside artists like @GrizzIe and @GettySelfmade.\n\nBeyond the spotlight, YOUNG S.H.O is a dedicated father to three boys and two girls, making him a multifaceted individual who balances his personal and professional life. His aspirations are firmly rooted in his desire to be the next Carolina artist to leave an indelible mark on the industry.\nAs he continues to drop bars and capture hearts, the question remains: will YOUNG S.H.O succeed in leaving a lasting trail in the sand? With his talent, determination, and rich background, the answer looks promising. Keep an eye on this rising star as he makes waves in the hip-hop scene.

        "description": "\n\nTrap music has a new face—and it’s one that’s preaching purpose, not just profit. MeetLarry Brock, the Baltimore-bred rap artist whose music goes beyond the surface. While many artists are chasing clout or streaming numbers, Larry is chasing something more eternal:truth, healing, and transformation.\nBorn and raised in one of the grittiest yet most soulful cities on the East Coast, Brock’s music reflects both the weight and the wonder of that upbringing. His sound is drenched in charisma—gritty drums, infectious hooks, and atmospheric production—but his message? That’s where the gold lies. Larry isn’t just rapping about the game; he’s offering a mirror to the soul of the culture. His bars are filled with self-examination, emotional clarity, and spiritual undertones that hit you long after the music fades.\nBrock doesn’t shy away from the heavy stuff. In fact, he confronts it head-on. Toxic love, the pain of personal loss, betrayal, family tension, inner battles—they all find space in his verses. But instead of letting these themes weigh the music down, he elevates them. His vulnerability becomes a superpower. His stories become sermons. Every beat is a beat of his heart, and every word feels like a whispered prayer for someone who’s been through the same.\nWhat makes Larry so compelling is that he never loses theedgeof trap while bringing in thedepthof conscious rap. This balance allows him to resonate with heads in the underground as well as casual listeners scrolling for their next banger. He’s bridging two worlds—thestreets and the spirit, thepain and the purpose—with grace, grit, and honesty.\nAnd people are noticing. His fanbase is growing, not just in Baltimore, but far beyond. Fans connect to his transparency, his fearlessness in telling the truth, and his undeniable ability to move a crowd emotionally and sonically. He’s the kind of artist whose music doesn’t just fill a playlist—it fills avoid. In a genre often criticized for glorifying materialism, Larry Brock offers something refreshing:music that matters.\nFor Brock, this isn’t just art. It’s a calling. Every song is crafted with intention. Every project is layered with meaning. He’s not trying to fit in—he’s creating space for others to come out of hiding. He’s proof that the underground is still alive, still speaking truth to power, and still nurturing artists who are in it for more than fame.\nLarry Brock is a reminder that trap can carry a message. That rap can still heal, still teach, still uplift.In a time when the world needs more authenticity and less ego, his voice is one worth listening to—loud, clear, and straight from the soul.\nConnect:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/iamlarrybrock/\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

Dropping July 23, 2025,Chunkadelicis more than an album–it’s a full-blown sonic universe where hip-hop collides with funk, jazz, and unfiltered joy.\nIf you’ve been sleeping on Nur-D, now’s the time to wake up. Known for his unapologetically nerdy, soulful, and vibrant approach to hip-hop, the Minnesota native has been carving out his own lane since his rise from the underground. ButChunkadelicisn’t just an extension of what he’s done before–it’s a creative leap that finds him fully embracing everything that makes himdifferent, anddialingit up to eleven.\nWith features from heavy hitters like The Lioness, El Par-0, Yare, and David Stangel, and production credits from DJ Hayes, Game,Remdolla, Fred Irie,PdubTheProducer, and EpikTheDawn, the album brings together a powerhouse lineup of collaborators. From start to finish,Chunkadelicpromises to be a ride through self-discovery, radical expression, and ass-shaking rebellion.\n“Ibuilt this album from the ground up– literally,” says Nur-D, referencingFairPlayEntertainment Studio, the creative hub he built with longtime collaborator DJ Hayes. “This isn’t just music. It’s a love letter to funk, to individuality, to joy–and to doing what the hell you want.”\nNur-D recently dropped a taste of what’s to come with the release of“PurpleInTheSky”, an early single from the project that’s already turning heads. The track blends dreamy nostalgia with tight, imaginative bars–taking viewers on an 8-bit, pixelated adventure through Minnesota that feels likeDonkey Kong CountrymeetsMidwest hip-hop.

        "description": "\nBeyond The Music, JuJu The Qui\nThe path to musical stardom often twists and turns, but the trajectory of Juju The Qui is particularly unique. From the structured discipline instilled by a military background, evidenced by his time as a tight end for the United States Military Academy, to the commanding presence honed as a drum major, and now culminating in the vibrant energy of a hip-hop artist, Juju The Qui’s diverse experiences have undeniably shaped his distinctive sound and captivating performance style. This includes tracks like his song “Frosted Lucky Charms” and the popular “Juju On That Beat”.\n“Being a drum major, that was a real lesson in leadership,” Juju The Qui reflects. “At first, I didnt fully grasp it, but when I truly understood the role and how it intertwined with production and the serious creative process, it empowered me to orchestrate the live shows Im now fortunate enough to create.” This dedication to crafting a complete experience stands out in a landscape where Juju The Qui believes artistic expectations sometimes fall short. “There are still many of us who pour immense pride and passion into delivering a true spectacle for our audiences,” he asserts.\n\nGrowing up immersed in the rich cultural tapestry of Hawai‘i has also profoundly influenced Juju The Quis sonic palette. “Its that classic saying, you become a product of your environment,” he explains. This inherent connection to the islands has been amplified through collaborations with artists and producers like Gohrilla and Bimwala. “[They] really pushed me to venture outside my comfort zone,” Juju The Qui acknowledges. Tracks like “Water,” “Honey Sugar,” “Aint Been the Same,” and the eagerly awaited “Jet” serve as prime examples of this boundary-pushing approach, seamlessly blending island vibes with contemporary sounds.\nInterestingly, the ambition that once fueled a dream of professional wrestling still resonates within Juju The Quis dynamic stage presence. “Professional wrestling, like all great entertainment, is about leaving a lasting impression,” he points out. “Each wrestler has that unique element that sets them apart – their identity, their moves, their overall presentation.” As a long-time fan, Juju The Qui has consciously incorporated these key elements into his own performances, ensuring that every show is a memorable event for the audience.\nThe latest buzz surrounds “The Tales of: KELSO & KUDO,” a highly anticipated collaboration with Juju The Quis cousin, Welo. “[This project] feels overdue in the best way possible,” Juju The Qui shares, highlighting their long history of making music together. “Its a chance to reflect on what weve put out there so far.” The creative direction for this project is clear: high energy and pure enjoyment. “Were like yin and yang, and a lot of people recognize that,” Juju The Qui explains. “This is us delivering something light and fun for everyone to connect with.”\nWhen it comes to live performances, a cornerstone of their artistic identity, Juju The Qui remains enigmatic yet confident. Asked to pinpoint the elements that make their shows unforgettable, the response is simply: “The only way I can best describe it is, you will have to see for yourself.” This invitation speaks volumes, hinting at an immersive and unique experience that transcends mere musical performance.\nThrough a journey that has taken unexpected turns, Juju The Qui has forged a distinct path in the hip-hop landscape. By embracing their diverse background and channeling their passions into their art, they continue to captivate audiences and leave an indelible mark with each performance.\nKeep up with him on social media @jujuthequi and via website athttps://jujuthequiofficial.com/.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

Diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder, he struggled with these challenges throughout his youth.\nThe gift of a toy piano at age 13 proved to be a pivotal moment, offering him an outlet and a means of escape from his pain. Music became increasingly important toFlex, especially as he grappled with the triggers of his past, which led to multiple arrests and two overdoses. Realizing the crucial role music played in his well-being, he dedicated himself to it, eventually living in a recording studio.

        "title": "Chxnny Is the New Voice Vancouver Has Been Waiting For",
        "description": "\nSome artists spend years trying to sound like someone else without even realizing it. Chxnny never wanted to be that kind of artist. At just nineteen years old, the Vancouver rapper and rnb artist has already made it clear that he is focused on creating something that feels real to him. His music is not about chasing trends or following what is popular. It is about finding a voice that nobody else has and making sure people know it is his the moment they hear it.\nChxnny’s story with music started young. He was only twelve when he began remixing songs and mixing them like a DJ. It was not about making perfect tracks back then. It was about playing around, feeling the energy of music, and learning what made a song move people. By fifteen, he was recording his own songs. They were rough at first, but they mattered because they were his. From the beginning, it was never just a hobby. It was something that stuck with him deeper than that.\nFinding a sound that stood out was not easy. It took a lot of late nights working on vocals, trying different presets, and layering effects until something clicked. Chxnny was not interested in being compared to artists like Nav or Travis Scott. He wanted to create a sound where the first few seconds of a track would tell you this was someone different. His songs often slide between low and high pitched vocals, blending in ways that do not feel forced. His flows do not follow the same paths you are used to. He pushes them in directions that are sometimes unpredictable but always natural.\nEven though he is still early in his career, signs of progress are already there. His track “CHANGE” got featured on RapMusic, one of the biggest rap pages on Instagram with more than five million followers. It was not a major award or a huge label deal, but it was real recognition. For an upcoming artist trying to break through all the noise, that kind of moment matters. It shows that people are starting to listen.\nWhen you ask Chxnny about his future, he speaks with no hesitation. He sees himself with millions of streams across platforms, playing shows for packed crowds, and being respected as a real artist. Not just someone who caught a viral moment and faded. He wants to be known for building something that lasts. Respect is the goal more than anything else.\nMusic is not a backup plan for him. It is the first plan and the only plan. Every song he drops is a step closer to the version of himself he knows he can be. His newest single “HOL UP” is another piece of that journey. It shows off his style, his voice, and the unique energy he brings into every track.\nIf you are looking for something fresh coming out of Vancouver, Chxnny is someone you are going to want to hear. You can listen to his new music and follow him on Instagramhereor find all his latest linkshere. It is not about copying anyone else. It is about creating something new, and that is exactly what he is doing.\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\n\nSung Eun Choi: An Accomplished Musician Who is Transforming the Musical Landscape\nSung Eun Choi is a multifaceted music artist, lyricist, composer, and vocalist who is achieving notable success in the music industry. Since his debut in 2013 with the song ‘Let Me Stop,’ he has released numerous tracks such as ‘I Love Hip Hop,’ ‘Spring Waltz,’ and ‘Sad Piano.’ Celebrated for his talent in creating engaging and lively melodies, his music blends New Age influences that offer comfort and warmth to his listeners. Sung Eun Choi’s new release, ‘Don’t Let It Stop’, highlights the artist’s genuine talent and creativity.\nHis musical compositions, notably ‘Sad Piano’ and ‘Spring Waltz,’ have garnered significant recognition across several European countries, consistently attaining top positions on the iTunes New Age chart. Sung Eun Choi exhibits a deep passion for delving into diverse musical styles, particularly hip hop. Additionally, he is in the process of planning future collaborations with other talented artists within the hip-hop genre, underscoring his versatility.\nThe Emergence of Hip-Hop: A Transformative Movement in Culture and Music\nHip-hop music, commonly known as hip-hop, has developed into one of the most significant genres globally. It originated in the early 1970s in New York City, influenced by a distinctive blend of musical styles and societal factors. Initially referred to as disco rap, it emerged from Bronx block parties where youth from ethnic minorities engaged with the culture.\nHip-hop music is defined by its rhythmic vocal expression, commonly referred to as rapping, which articulates rhymed poetic messages aimed at highlighting social and political concerns. While the term ‘hip-hop’ is often linked specifically to rap music, the genre actually encompasses a broader spectrum, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and intricate instrumental arrangements that play a significant role in the hip-hop subculture.\nThe Rise of Hip-Hop\nThe initial growth of hip-hop paralleled advancements in technology, which facilitated the accessibility of sampling and drum machines for emerging artists. DJs at community gatherings utilized two turntables and a mixer to repeat percussive segments from well-known tracks, producing breaks that prolonged the music. As these methods advanced, scratching and beatmatching became essential components of hip-hop, while rapping developed into a unique vocal style characterized by rhythmic speech over synthesized beats.\nAlthough it originated from grassroots movements, hip-hop music was not formally recorded or disseminated in mainstream media until 1979, primarily due to economic challenges and its initial failure to gain widespread acceptance. Nonetheless, it rose to prominence through block parties in African American communities and quickly reached a wider audience. The initial phase of hip-hop, referred to as old-school hip hop, was shaped by disco rhythms, with lyrics centered around themes of celebration, enjoyment, and dancing.\nThe Era of Hip-Hop’s Greatness and Its Global Impact\nIn the 1980s, a new genre of hip hop known as new-school emerged, characterized by its electro sound. This era, referred to as the Golden Age of Hip Hop, spanned from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s and was distinguished by groundbreaking musical techniques and the release of impactful albums. During this period, gangsta rap rose to prominence, illustrating the harsh realities and challenges encountered by youth in urban areas. Additionally, distinct regional styles began to develop; West Coast hip-hop gained fame for its G-funk sound, while East Coast hip-hop showcased styles such as jazz rap, alternative hip-hop, and hardcore hip-hop.\nThe 1990s witnessed the emergence of Southern rap and the ascent of Atlanta hip-hop, contributing to the genre’s increasing diversity. By the mid-1990s, hip-hop had established itself as the highest-selling music genre, ultimately overtaking rock in terms of sales. The year 1989 marked a significant development in the industry as hip-hop music was officially acknowledged at the Grammy Awards with the creation of the Best Rap Performance category, awarded to DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince for their popular song, ‘Parents Just Don’t Understand.’ This accolade represented a crucial milestone in the mainstream acceptance of hip-hop.\nThe Role of Sung Eun Choi in Shaping the Future of Hip-Hop\nSung Eun Choi’s contributions to the hip-hop genre signify a promising development in the music industry. His commitment to blending various musical styles while remaining true to hip hop showcases his ability to impact the genre. With forthcoming collaborations and a fervor for creativity, Sung Eun Choi is set to emerge as a significant player in the international hip-hop landscape.\nConnect:\n@sungeunchoigo\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "title": "Donald Walker Brings Back Clean, Soulful Hip Hop with “Superhero”",
        "description": "\nHip Hop is much more than just music. Although music is a major part of it, the word hip hop is used to describe a culture. Included in this culture are many components, including distinctive ways of walking, talking, dressing and thinking: In short, it is a way of life, and a way to express how one views life in the community in which they live, particularly the African America Community.\nDonald Walker ‘s first involvement in music came in the early 60’s when he joined his grade-school’s marching band. From there he went on to make his mark in the music business as a drummer, bandleader, producer and song-writer, releasing songs on his own record label, Posh Records. Although his roots are centered around early R&B music from the 60’s and70’s, Donald has always been able to adapt to the ever changing times associated with the music industry.\nWhen Hip Hop music first arrived on the scene, Donald was reluctant to embraced it. Growing up listeningto artists like the Temptations, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Four Tops and more, it is easy to see why he was a little reluctant to embrace music that was so different.Overtime, Donald was able to recognize and even appreciate the significance of hip hop music and the culture as a whole.\nAlthough he embraced the music, Donald, like so many others from his era, never quite got use to the profanity associated with hip hop music. He also thought the music was oversaturated with negative words directed towards women. In response to his concerns, and the concerns of so many others of his era, in 1992, Donald decided to write a rap song without the usual profanity.He also felt the need to write a song wherewomen had a place to turn to when they felt disrespected by their partner. Hence, Donald wrote Superhero: a song dedicated to rescuing ladies in their emotional distress. To Donald, the song was all in good fun.\nAfter recording Superhero in 1992, Donald was told, by people in the music industry, that the song would never be accepted in the hip hop world. Taking the advice of his peers, Donald simply put the song aside, and did not release it.\nTwenty-three years later, in 2025, Donald decided to revisit the idea of a Superhero in rap, and released his original version to the public.\nThe song features a steady and heavy dose of bass guitar, supported by a strong back-beat from the drums. The synthesizer seems to jump out at you, screaming with authority throughout. Donald’s voice is calm and smooth but the message is loud and clear;\n“Ifthe one you’re with don’t appreciate you, then here I come to therescue.”\nThe song has flavor, soul and plenty of grit. The words are clear and precise; even grandma will understand. A good song to get you up and out on the dance floor, all the while keeping it clean and fun.\nRealistically, even today this song may be difficult for the hard-core hip hop enthusiasts to except, but to some it just may be thealternative to the norm, and quite possibly the start of something new. You be the judge.\n\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

The track is quickly gaining momentum and blowing up on streaming platforms, particularly Tidal, where fans are flocking to experience this energetic fusion firsthand.\nThe collaboration, facilitated through Bentley Records, sees Rast Dias and Twista exploring powerful narratives of triumph, struggle, and aspiration. “Meteorite” uniquely combines Rast Dias’s vibrant Dancehall energy and lyrical authenticity from Jamaica with Twista’s unmistakable high-speed lyrical flow and gritty American hip-hop influence.

        "title": "Sirr Da Vinci Sets the Stage Ablaze: The Hunger, The Heat, and the Hard Truth Behind His May 17th Performance and Upcoming Project",
        "description": "\nIn the heart of Georgia, where dreams are forged in fire and grit, rising artist Sirr Da Vinci is gearing up for one of his most pivotal performances to date. Hailing from Dublin, GA, and steadily carving out his lane in hip-hop, Sirr is set to bring that raw, unapologetic energy to the Knockout Bar & Lounge in College Park, GA, on May 17th. The show, part of the “From The East To The West” tour presented by Mor Bookings Agency and It’s Gorgeous Musique, isn’t just a performance for him—it’s a war cry.\n“This performance means everything,” Sirr shares. “Personally, it’s a reminder that I’m still here, still building, still proving myself. Professionally, it’s a chance to show the people watching that I’m not just another name—I’m the one they overlooked, and I’m about to make it undeniable.”\nWith an 8-minute set packed with intensity, Sirr will perform his standout records “Introversion” and “Heartless,” while also debuting a few unreleased tracks—giving fans a raw glimpse into what’s to come. Each track is handpicked not for hype, but for impact. “Every time I hit that stage, it’s war for respect,” he says. And for Sirr Da Vinci, that war is fought with bars, presence, and purpose.\nI Told You So: A Summer Drop with Intent\nAs if the stage wasn’t enough, Sirr has his sights set on a summer takeover with the release of his upcoming project, I Told You So. The name says it all. It’s not just an album—it’s a message. “They’ve never heard me like this before,” he promises.\nUnlike his earlier work that was centered around finding his voice, I Told You So is Sirr speaking with clarity, rage, and resolve. “This project came from a place of hunger. I’ve always had something to say, but this one is more aggressive, more intentional. The last ones were about finding my voice—this one is me using it loud and clear.”\nThat hunger manifests not just in lyricism but in the sonic choices as well. The production is tighter. The writing is sharper. The project doesn’t beg for attention—it demands it.\nSirr has kept most of the features in-house, prioritizing authenticity over big-name appearances. One notable exception is Aliwisshes, a close collaborator whose chemistry with Sirr is unmatched. “He’s family, and our chemistry is effortless.” On the production side, Low from Low Down Media steps in, not only as a producer but also Sirr’s cameraman. That dual role gives Low a deeper understanding of Sirr’s vision—capturing both the sound and the soul of the project.\nA Voice Sharpened by Growth\nLeading up to this moment, Sirr Da Vinci’s evolution has been both musical and personal. He speaks with the clarity of someone who’s done the inner work—and translated it into outer success. “I used to second-guess a lot, but now I say what I feel and stand on it,” he says. “The sound evolved with that confidence—more layered, more aggressive, but still real.”\nThat evolution is critical, especially for an artist who’s navigating the music industry without major backing. “Honestly? The biggest challenge is doing everything with limited resources. I don’t have a big machine behind me—just passion, vision, and the will to make it happen,” Sirr admits. But that struggle has only made the foundation stronger. “Every step is earned.”\nIn an era where overnight fame often overshadows long-term consistency, Sirr Da Vinci is building brick by brick—carefully, intentionally, and with an eye on legacy.\nMay 17th: The Warning Shot\nWhen Sirr hits the stage at Knockout Bar & Lounge, it won’t be just another rap set. It will be a declaration. “I want people to leave saying, ‘Yeah, he’s different,’” Sirr says. “Energy, presence, bars—everything. This is a warning shot for the summer. If they didn’t know before, they will after May 17th.”\nThose who attend will get more than music—they’ll get a story in real-time. One of struggle, resilience, and redemption. It’s a rare chance to witness an artist at the brink—not of collapse, but of breakthrough.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nWhere to Watch the Rise\nFor those who want to follow Sirr Da Vinci’s journey after the performance, he’s most active on Instagram and TikTok (@sirrdavinci), where he shares updates, behind-the-scenes content, and appreciation for the fans riding with him from the jump.\n“This summer’s gonna be wild, and I want everybody who’s been rocking with me to be part of the come-up,” Sirr says.\nIt’s more than music. It’s a movement.\nFollow Sirr Da Vinci:\nUpcoming Performance:\nDate: May 17th\nVenue: Knockout Bar & Lounge, College Park, GA\nTour: “From The East To The West” by Mor Bookings Agency & It’s Gorgeous Musique\nNext Release: I Told You So – dropping summer 2025.

        "title": "From Hawks Ball Boy to Visionary Lens: The Raw Journey of Justin Kase",
        "description": "\nYour journey in entertainment began as a ball boy for the Atlanta Hawks—how did that early grind mold your hustle?\nYo, the Hawks? That was my jump-off. Courtside view to the real. Saw the sweat, the wins, the losses up close. That early exposure? It injected straight-up discipline, teamwork, and that never-quit mentality into my veins. Still the fuel for everything I’m on now.\nYou’ve worked in radio for over sixteen years—what was that pivotal moment that shifted everything?\nMic check moment in radio? Gotta be snatching that first on-air slot. That’s when the light bulb went off – the realness of connecting live, direct to the people. Set the blueprint for all my moves since. Had the city on lock, for real. Even picked up those collect calls from the inside so folks locked up could shout out their fam and get their anthem played. Got me in some trouble, though, you know how it goes.\nMEGAN THEE STALLION\nZaytoven Radio on SiriusXM was major. What was it like linking with a heavyweight like Zay?\nMan, that was a whole different level. Got the boot from a radio gig, then two days later, my old school hits me – Zaytoven wants the hottest voice to launch ‘Zaytoven Radio.’ Humble G made the connect with Roland, Zay’s general, then Z himself. If you know Zay, you know the basement. That legendary spot where he cooked up classics with Atlanta legends way back when. That whole chapter? Legendary status in my book.\nWe started on Roland’s station, Digital Dope Radio, then leveled up to Hip Hop Nation on Sirius, salute to Humble G and Reggie Hawkins. Unreal times. Zaytoven, Roland – y’all ever thinking of running that back? For real though!\nWhat sparked the move from the airwaves to behind the lens, and when did you know it was the right call?\nTwo thousand seventeen was a turning point. Stepped into rehab to shake off the heavy stuff. Counselor told me I needed a focus to stay clean. Roland was offloading a camera, so I copped it. Started snapping everything – bugs, whips, animals. Then Jeremy B. pushed me towards capturing people. That’s when it hit different – photography wasn’t just a way to kill time; it was a new fire, a real purpose ignited.\nYou’ve shot celebs and linked with giants like The New York Times and People. What shoot resonates the most?\nEvery single shot carries weight, fam. Someone choseme. That trust? That never fades. Honored to lock in with the big leagues like The New York Times and People, and those celeb moments? They teach you levels. But shooting concerts? That’s pure electricity. Capturing that raw energy, live and direct? That’s the fuel that keeps this fire burning.\nHow does your history in radio and entertainment shape your vision with the camera?\nRadio schooled me in telling stories, connecting with people. That bleeds straight into how I frame a shot. It’s about capturing those moments that hit you in the chest, like a dope track on the airwaves. The entertainment hustle taught me the details, the timing – crucial for live events and portraits. Used to the fast pace, so I can adapt quickly and still nail that iconic shot. Radio also gave me a feel for the rhythm, which helps in crafting visuals that just feel right. My whole journey in entertainment? It sharpened how I see and capture the world through my lens.\nSmiling at supporters\nNew question- What are your three favorite photos that you took?\nThree joints I gotta put on blast? My shots of President Joe Biden, Kodak Black, and Megan Thee Stallion. Each one’s a different vibe, a different challenge conquered. Biden felt like capturing a moment in history. Kodak and Megan? Pure raw energy, the kind of portraits I live for. Those images? They’re a reminder of the journey and the power this photography game holds.\nAs a creative entrepreneur, what gems of wisdom would you drop on others looking to switch lanes in the industry?\nStay fluid. Don’t fear hitting reset – your past hustle ain’t wasted. Surround yourself with those who elevate you, who got your back. Be patient with the process; this reinvention? It demands time, consistency, and believing in your own damn self. Most crucial? Stay locked onto your passion. That’s the compass guiding you through every transition.\nWhat’s the next level for Justin Kase? What’s on deck?\nStay tuned in to witness the next moves. If you’re looking to invest or sponsor my documentary or my non-profit, ‘Addicts With Voice,’ slide into my DMs on IG.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/justinphoto\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nAfter an exclusive early access listen to Mirages @ Midnight 2, it’s clear that Shai Coke is once again pushing the boundaries of scam rap while staying true to his unique sound. Detroit’s own Shai Coke isn’t just contributing to the genre, he’s shaping it. As he prepares to officially drop his latest project this June, Shai remains rooted in the authentic sound and narrative that have set him apart from the start. With his signature nocturnal vibe, gritty storytelling, and refusal to blend in, Shai’s presence in the genre is increasingly undeniable.\nFollowing the success of the first installment, which amassed over a million streams, Mirages @ Midnight 2 builds on the foundation laid by its predecessor while pushing Shai’s artistry forward. Fans of the original will recognize the raw, unfiltered storytelling that made the project resonate with listeners, while newcomers will find a uniquely immersive experience shaped by Shai’s distinct voice and vision.\nConsistency, Authenticity, and a Cult Following\nFrom his earliest tracks, Shai Coke has built a reputation for following his own path rather than chasing trends. In a genre where many artists capitalize on hype without truly living the lifestyle, Shai’s music is strikingly different rooted not just in catchy rhymes but in real experiences. His songs aren’t fabricated tales of scamming for the sake of a punchline they’re vivid recollections, reflections of actual moments that give listeners a genuine insight into his life.\nThat commitment to authenticity has allowed Shai to carve out a unique space within the genre. Fans who have been with him from the start recognize his dedication to telling his story rather than recycling the same played-out narratives. This unfiltered realism makes his music resonate on a deeper level, building a cult-like following that values his honesty.\nA Sound That Stays True to the Streets\nWith Mirages @ Midnight 2, Shai builds on the dark, late-night feel that has defined his sound since the beginning. The album’s smooth, piano and guitar-driven beats perfectly complement his raw storytelling. Songs like ScamGPT, Prada Mane, and Clean Up demonstrate Shai’s knack for blending introspection with street realism, while tracks like Playstation Plus and All Dogs Go to Heaven showcase his ability to craft smooth, late-night anthems that feel both personal and timeless.\nWhile other artists may turn to scam rap as a gimmick, Shai’s approach is different. His songs are more than just entertainment, they’re documentation. Whether reflecting on moments of triumph, struggle, or just daily life, every line holds weight because it’s rooted in something real. That dedication to truth-telling has made his music feel purposeful rather than performative.\nSolidifying a Legacy Built on Realness\nMirages @ Midnight 2 features two heavy-hitting collaborators: Nino2Muxh and Cuss Creep, whose massive following on TikTok (over 1.5 million) brings significant attention to the project. Tracks like Just Ride highlight the undeniable chemistry between Shai and Nino, while Hoang Bi brings together Shai, Cuss, and Nino for a powerful collaborative moment.\nAs Shai Coke continues to drop new music and build his discography, one thing remains clear: this is more than just a genre for him. It’s a way of documenting his reality raw, unfiltered, and without compromise. While other artists may come and go, his commitment to reflecting real life through his lyrics will ensure his legacy in scam rap and beyond.\nFor those seeking real, unpretentious storytelling, Mirages @ Midnight 2 is more than just an album it’s a statement of Shai Coke’s authenticity and his place at the forefront of a movement rooted in truth; its undisputed.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "title": "Education Through Music Gala 2025: Making Minds Sing",
        "description": "Education Through Music (ETM) is a premier nonprofit organization that provides educational equity through a lasting music program to nearly 20,000 students in under-resourced schools in New York City. On Thursday, May 15th, the organization held their 2025 fundraising gala at the historic and sophisticated 583 Park Avenue.\nETM Board and Supporters\nThe evening opened with an inviting cocktail hour for attendees to mingle. Guests included: supporters from the real estate industry, investment banking, and the music field, as well as supporters, advocates, and community leaders. The room was filled with warm conversation and laughter as we anticipated a spectacular performance by the children.\nAfter being ushered to our seats in the beautifully decorated banquet room, we were greeted via video byCommon. He welcomed all in attendance and introduced his long-time supporter and mentor,Sway Calloway, who served as the evening’s emcee. Calloway, a Hip-Hop icon and music journalist returned to the 2025 gala by popular demand and led the night with charisma, brilliance, and warmth.\nSoon PS 72 Band, “The Dewey Decibels” took to the stage. As a former lover of music class, my heart was full. Seeing the children be so brave and confident, performing in front of so many people is proof that ETM has made a pivotal impact. It triggered fond memories of learning the songs from Grease as a youth and singing them in school plays.\nThe Impact Award was given toFrank Alvarado, Senior Managing Director, Global Head of Enterprise Project Management Operations at CBRE | Turner & Townsend, for his leadership in the community and dedication to music for underserved students.\n“As a society, we need children with access to music education like Education Through Music […], It will create adults with cadence and determination and if we are lucky, some will also become adults who will inspire us!”Alvarado encouraged.\nAt the gala the first inductees to the newly created Legacy Circle were recognized – a trio of ETM’s most generous and ardent supporters over the last few decades –Katherine Elliott,Andrew J. Malik, andMichael Schaefer. Each has given to the organization in ways that have allowed ETM to not only continue its transformative work, but to expand over the years to an increasing number of partner schools.\nChris Atlas (left) , Keanan Duffty (right)\nChris Atlas, founder of Atlas Entertainment, introduced the evening’sMusic Innovation Awardrecipient,Keanan Duffty, founder of the punk band Slinky Vagabond. In his acceptance remarks, Duffty shared,\n“Over the past month, I’ve had the privilege of witnessing the hard work and passion of these young musicians and it brought back vivid memories of my formative days. Watching them grow under the guidance of their incredible teachers reminded me why programs like Education Through Music are so essential.”\nFounded in 1991, Education Through Music has been a champion of music education, providing over 8 million hours of instruction. The gala served as a platform to showcase ETM’s continued commitment to providing high-quality and comprehensive music education to students in under-resourced schools.\nThe Hallows performing\n\nETM students warmed every heart in the room throughout the night. Performances also featured students from PS 154 & the Queens School of Inquiry and ETM’s high-school rock band, The Hallows.\n“My words tonight cannot do justice to what I have seen in the classrooms and auditoriums of ETM’s partner schools. […] Children who exhibit pride, experience joy and who feel good about themselves and what they are doing,”saidDr. Janice Weinman, CEO of Education Through Music in her remarks to the guests.\nThe Education Through Music Gala 2025 was an intentional, touching evening of entertainment, philanthropy, and advocacy. Properly themed “Making Minds Sing,” the event highlighted the importance of music education in transmuting so much of what we sometimes can’t express in words into sound. The event brought together supporters who directly contribute to ETM’s mission of ensuring that every child has access to a quality music education.\nFor more information about Education Through Music and to support their mission, please visit\nETMonline.org\n© 2025,Siani Leigh.

        "description": "\nAt a young age, I always wanted to do music, but my older cousin inspired my journey.\nI felt like I wanted to pursue music seriously after my first song. I saw the reaction of people and it made me feel good.\n“Yea Yea” was the first song I recorded and I remember being in the studio making the song and it took about 4 hours.\nMy biggest influences were J. Cole, Lil Baby, and Lil Durk.\nOriginally, it was Lil JJ. That name was taken; so, I decided to add the word “World” to make it like everyone was in my world.\nWhen I first saw my face on a NYC bill board, I felt like I could do this!\nI haven’t faced in major challenges. The only challenges have been self-doubt because of the constructive criticism that I received from my team. Looking back, those criticisms shaped the artist I am now.\nMy family and friends played a huge role in my journey-and I don’t take that support lightly. Their encouragement gave me the strength to push through and they also helped by promoting my music on their platforms.\nMy style has tremendously evolved from that young elementary type music to faster beats and more teen related stuff.\nAlways think positive and believe in yourself.\nCelebrity,Culture,Editor’s Spotlight,Entrepreneur,lifestyle,Music,TrendingBET,Celebrity,full circle marketing,Higher Frequency,Hip Hop,Indie,Its64boy,limitless Magazine,major88keys,Music,new music,Rap,Recording Artist,Stackin Up Ent,stackinupent\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nOn May 3, 2025, SilverLakes in Norco, California transformed into a vibrant playground of music, tacos, and tequila, as thousands poured in for the highly anticipated Taco Fest 2025. Hosted by Activated and Bobby Dee Presents, the one-day festival lived up to the hype, delivering a wild fusion of food, culture, and legendary hip-hop energy.\nFrom the moment gates opened, the aroma of sizzling carne asada and al pastor filled the air. With over 1,000 varieties of tacos from local vendors and food trucks, guests indulged in everything from traditional street-style favorites to fusion takes like Korean BBQ tacos and vegan jackfruit options. Complementing the flavors was an impressive selection of over 101 tequila brands, turning the venue into a spirited tasting experience.\nBut Taco Fest wasn’t just about food—it was a full-blown party. The festival boasted an epic lineup of iconic hip-hop artists, bringing serious nostalgia and nonstop energy to the stage. Headliners included Atlanta legend T.I., party king Lil Jon, Bronx heavyweight Fat Joe, and St. Louis hitmaker Chingy. The Ying Yang Twins had the crowd bouncing with early 2000s classics, while Paul Wall and Bubba Sparxxx brought Southern flavor to the West Coast.\n\nThe atmosphere was electric. A sea of fans—young and old—sang along to timeless hits under the California sun. DJ Luwiss Lux kept the tempo high between sets, spinning a mix of classics and current bangers that had the crowd dancing all day long. Adding to the fun was a lively taco-themed mascot hyping up guests and keeping spirits high.\nBeyond the music and food, the event also paid homage to Latino culture with art installations, themed merchandise, and interactive booths. The festival grounds were adorned with vibrant décor and palm trees, creating a laid-back yet festive vibe that captured the spirit of Southern California.\nTaco Fest 2025 wasn’t just an event—it was a celebration of culture, community, and timeless music. Whether you came for the tacos, tequila, or throwback hits, one thing was clear: this festival was the ultimate kick-off to summer. As fans spilled out of SilverLakes at sundown, one thing echoed in conversations—Taco Fest set the bar high, and they’ll be back for more next year.\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Strategy KI returns to GRM Daily with a certified banger",
        "description": "\n“Only A Zip” landed on GRM Daily’s YouTube channel three weeks ago, instantly giving the record a springboard to the UK’s largest online rap audience. GRM Daily’s track record speaks for itself: the platform has broken artists from Stormzy to Central Cee and remains the go‑to discovery hub for British street music, racking up over five billion views to date. ([YouTube][1], [YouTube][2])\nStrategy KI operates fully independently—no label advances, just self‑funding and smart partnerships. Away from the studio he’s a *verified* TikToker, where his rapid‑fire freestyles and behind‑the‑scenes clips have built a six‑figure following that regularly spills over into streaming spikes. He’s also leveraged his business acumen into a streetwear line produced in collaboration with long‑time engineering ally Immortal Mixed It, turning fans into walking billboards while keeping merch revenue in‑house.\nThe beat is quintessential UK drill—ice‑cold piano stabs, sliding 808s, and a swung snare pattern that leaves plenty of negative space. What separates it from the pack is the mix: Immortal Mixed It’s fingerprints are all over the tight low‑end and airy top‑end, ensuring the sub punches on club rigs without clouding the mids.\nStrategy KI fires out syllables with surgical precision, weaving in half‑time pockets that contrast his more rapid cadences. He sprinkles melodic bends on key words, a subtle nod to the current wave of “melodic drill” without losing his trademark grit.\n\nOn paper the hook—“All I need’s one zip, watch it flip, then I’m ghost”—could read like standard trap bravado, but Strategy balances hustle talk with flashes of vulnerability: references to rising studio costs, learning to market himself, and the high stakes of independence. The escape motif ties neatly back to earlier singles like “#ESC,” creating a mini‑narrative for core fans.\nShot in desaturated greys and muted ambers, the visuals mirror the song’s tension between grind and glamour. Rapid jump‑cuts sync with 808 slides, while slow‑motion shots of the clothing line stitch product placement into the narrative without feeling forced.\nGetting a GRM Daily co‑sign while remaining unsigned is no small feat. The platform’s algorithmic push and cultural cachet frequently translate into playlist adds and radio spins; for an indie like Strategy KI, that exposure is equivalent to a mini‑label campaign. ([GRM Daily][3])\n“Only A Zip” showcases Strategy KI’s DIY empire in full effect: self‑funded visuals, in‑house mixing, and merch all feeding back into the music. Coupled with GRM Daily’s amplification, the single positions him to convert TikTok momentum into long‑term catalogue streams.\n© 2025,Tedfuel. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nIn a time when authenticity in music is often clouded by algorithms and trends,“Living”byStrategy KIandSimple Life, in collaboration withImmortal Mixed.It, slices through the noise with raw emotion, introspective storytelling, and genre-blending finesse. Set to premiere onVEVOonMay 21st, 2025, this track is more than a song—it’s a statement of resilience and reality.\nFrom the opening bars,“Living”sets a reflective tone, merging mellow production with thought-provoking lyricism. Strategy KI delivers a performance steeped in life experience—his flow is measured but impactful, like someone who’s seen both the gutter and the glow-up. There’s no flexing for attention here—just real talk about survival, purpose, and pain.\n\nSimple Life complements the atmosphere with a melodic chorus that lingers long after the final note. Their soulful hook ties everything together, offering a bittersweet contrast that amplifies the track’s emotional weight. The production—handled byImmortal Mixed.It—is crisp, understated, and deeply textured, allowing both artists’ voices to shine without distraction.\nWhat makes“Living”stand out is its universality. Whether you’ve struggled with inner demons, faced financial hardship, or simply questioned your place in the world, this track speaks directly to the heart. It’s introspective but accessible, poetic yet grounded.\nThe upcoming VEVO visual release promises to deepen the message, with imagery that mirrors the song’s themes of duality—light and shadow, hope and hardship. With Strategy KI continuing to push creative boundaries and Simple Life adding a fresh layer of soul,“Living”is a standout moment in 2025 evolving UK music landscape.\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

Her latest EP,Southern Belle, doesn’t just mark a milestone in her career—it declares her arrival. Rooted in grit and grace, the project offers a raw, soulful glimpse into the life of an artist shaped by hardship, determination, and unapologetic authenticity.\nKeePushinKPwas born in Ruleville, Mississippi, a town steeped in civil rights history and Southern resilience. Her journey has taken her through the musical corridors of St. Louis, Memphis, and Kentucky, each city adding texture and tone to her evolving sound. Over the past decade, she’s sharpened her craft, building a lyrical voice that reflects both vulnerability and strength. Her stage name isn’t just a moniker—it’s a mindset: relentless forward motion.\nIn 2020, her life changed dramatically when she survived a shooting that left her with multiple gunshot wounds. The trauma might have silenced another artist, butKeePushinKPturned pain into purpose. She returned to music with renewed urgency, transforming her platform into one that advocates for survivors of violence. Her songs, laced with defiance and soul, are cathartic declarations of survival.\n\nSouthern Bellecaptures her growth—both as an artist and a woman reclaiming her narrative. Influenced by artists likeLauryn Hill’sintrospective poetry,Big K.R.I.T.’sSouthern storytelling, andNicki Minaj’sfearless charisma, she blends those elements into something wholly her own. Her delivery is deliberate, her rhymes sharp, her perspective unfiltered. There’s a rare honesty that threads through every track, grounded in her Southern roots yet expansive in reach.\nNow promoting the EP across the West Coast,KeePushinKPis widening her impact without losing touch with her origin.

She’s a voice forged in struggle and refined through resilience. Her music stands as testimony—not only to what she’s endured but to what she’s destined to become.

The record, built on real emotion and lived experience, is a clear reflection of where he’s at: grounded, growing, and focused.\n“Honest” isn’t the result of some sudden epiphany. It is the result of honesty at home, in marriage, and in the long-term commitment that fuels both his personal life and the process of writing a song. “When I write a love song, I’m trying to peel back another layer of that relationship,” he says.\nThe music is smooth but sophisticated without sacrificing heart.J-lilsings a melodic truth that breaks through the clutter, a vulnerable glance at how to walk around with emotional baggage, but still be in the middle of your duties. The lyrics aren’t questions, but rather confessions.\nThere’s more at play behind the scenes, though. J-lil isn’t just concerned with creating solid tracks as he’s constructing the support system behind them. “I’ve been super focused, not just on the music, but on developing the support structure for it,” he explains. That means everything from content creation to visual strategy to long-term branding. This isn’t hustle culture, it is strategic building. While the majority of creatives are chasing trends, J-lil is chasing longevity. And longevity requires more than talent and discipline. He is aware that music is just part of the formula.\nAs for the future, J-lil’s response is not tied to a single release date or flashy announcement. It has to do with consistency. “Showing up,” he calls it. The collaborations, the music, the live performances are on the way, but more than anything, so is the gradual unveiling of who J-lil is as an artist and who he is, period.\nListen to J-lil’s new single “Honest” out now everywhere.\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/0blvAJFcT9chKJK3dLqay0\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nIf you haven’t tapped in withLyrical Chrisyet, now is the time. The rising artist who’s been turning heads for his genre-breaking concept of5D Rapjust released his newest single,“Mind of the Grandchild,”and it’s everything hip-hop didn’t know it needed.\nComing out of the gate with a fresh vision,Lyrical Chrispositions himself as “Hip Hop’s Grandchild” which is a nod to both the culture’s foundation and its future. But make no mistake, this isn’t throwback rap. With“Mind of the Grandchild,”Chris blends nostalgic storytelling with forward-thinking creativity. The beat gives West Coast vibes while the flow gives New York roots, and the content? Pure originality.\nThe single plays like a short film in audio form, and the track is now accompanied by a music video. It walks listeners through a story set in Los Angeles, told straight from Chris’s perspective.“Mind of the Grandchild”is very detailed, immersive, and features a high level of wordplay. But what really stands out is the twist at the end, one that flips the entire narrative on its head. You will have to listen to it through to experience for yourself, as it’s rare that a hip-hop track is structured this thoughtfully and executed this cleanly.\n“Mind of the Grandchild” also serves as a teaser for his upcoming concept project titledRough Draft,which Lyrical Chris plans to be a groundbreaking musical essay made up of five albums, or “paragraphs,” where the songs act as sentences. This kind of format has never been done before, and it fits perfectly with Lyrical Chris’ mission to push boundaries while lifting vibrations.\nThe unique genre that Chris classifies himself in, 5D Rap, is all about consciousness. It’s clean, non-materialistic, non-religious (but spiritual), and always uplifting. He mentioned there are ten self-imposed rules that he follows in every song, including no explicit lyrics, no dissing, no toxic bars, and no fear-based messaging. It’s hip-hop that respects the culture while raising the bar.\nWith chart placements on Billboard and iTunes already under his belt, plus consistent gym rotation across 4,000+ locations in the U.S., Lyrical Chris is proving that you don’t have to compromise to make an impact.\nWatch the music video for“Mind of the Grandchild”out now and get a taste of what hip-hop sounds like when it evolves with intention.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAJcIPCAR2I\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\nBrooklyn-born and built for this rap life, Nuk is closing out 2024 with a straight-up emotional banger. His latest single,“Free Wordie,”ain’t just music—it’s a heartfelt message wrapped in raw bars and heavy beats. It’s a dedication to the homies locked up, the folks who feel caged by life, and anyone grinding through pain while still holding on to hope. Nuk ain’t just rapping—he’s venting, reflecting, and motivating all at once.\nFrom the jump, you can tell this one comes from a real place. The lyrics hit deep—talking about loyalty, struggle, and that constant battle between frustration and faith. It’s got that late-night ride energy, where every line makes you reflect. Nuk’s storytelling is sharp, vulnerable, and grounded in truth. This ain’t for clout—this is therapy through music.\nAnd the backstory? It just adds weight. Nuk grew up in the heart of Brooklyn, surrounded by culture, chaos, and creativity. He started recording at 14, and now, posted up in Delaware County, PA, he’s still reppin’ with that same Brooklyn fire. You can hear it in his tone—he’s got that gritty city essence, no matter where he’s at. He’s moving independently, no industry puppet strings—just pure hustle and heart.\nYou can tell Nuk grew up studying the greats—Jay Z, Nas, Birdman, Dipset—you feel those influences in his cadence and confidence.

        "title": "“Hip-Hop’s Hidden Manuscript: How 2WIIN KINGZ Are Turning Tracklists Into Timeless Literature”",
        "description": "\nIn an era where singles dominate playlists and albums often feel like afterthoughts, the 2WIIN KINGZ are rewriting the rules of Hip-Hop—literally. This Flatbush-based duo isn’t just dropping music; they’re crafting a living, breathing manuscript. One that you can not only hear butread. And it’s hiding in plain sight.\nThe concept is both simple and revolutionary:each of their song titles—across every album—connect to form a narrative when read in sequence.It’s the kind of creative architecture rarely seen in any genre, let alone Hip-Hop. The deeper you dig, the clearer it becomes—this isn’t a gimmick. It’s a literary blueprint. And the 2WIIN KINGZ are the architects.\nTheir recent appearance onShock The Culture(jump to the 20:00 mark) brought this concept to light in a way that stunned even longtime fans. Hosted by Dom Hollins and Kirk Rich, the show gave the duo space to break down how every track title is intentional—designed to be a thread in the larger story they’ve been telling since the early 2000s. From their debut to their latest track,By Design, their discography is one continuous message in motion.\nThis commitment to structure is rare in modern Hip-Hop, where the market often rewards quick hits and viral moments. But 2WIIN KINGZ have always been built different. They’ve served in war zones, survived real-life trauma, and walked through fire to stand here today. When they write, they write from experience, from pain, from purpose—and that’s why the titles hold so much weight. Every name is a choice. Every project, a chapter.\nBut it’s not just the song titles that tell a story—their bars are equally rich. Their lyrics merge the raw essence of Brooklyn with introspective wisdom. They reflect on love, legacy, broken systems, materialism, and manhood with the honesty of veterans and the skill of lyrical scientists. This isn’t rap as performance—it’s rap as testimony.\nAnd while they’ve built a kingdom on penmanship, what makes 2WIIN KINGZ stand out is their values. They don’t seek fame for ego—they seek impact. In interviews, they’ve shared that their dream is to begood men, great fathers, and artists who leave something that matters. Their music is about more than just rhythm—it’s about responsibility, resilience, and reclaiming your narrative.\nWithBy Design, they’ve reached a powerful new point in their story—a song that questions superficial values and re-centers the conversation around authenticity. Yet even that track is another puzzle piece in a legacy still being written. It reminds listeners that none of this is by accident. It’s been intentional. It’s all been—by design.\nSo if you’re ready for music that doesn’t just play in your headphones butlives in your mind, dive into the discography. Start with the titles. Watch them unfold. Then press play. You’re not just listening to rap—you’re reading a manuscript. One that may go down as one of the most slept-on achievements in Hip-Hop history.\n🎧 Read & hear the full story:https://music.apple.com/us/artist/2wiin-kingz/1597662190📺 Interview that reveals the concept (20:00):https://www.youtube.com/live/BCEHEoH_3UE\n#2WIINKINGZ #ByDesign #TrackTitleStorytelling #ShockTheCulture #BrooklynBars #HipHopLegacy #AppleMusic #StorytellersInDisguise\n© 2025,Variety Press.

        "description": "\n\nExploring the Boundaries Between Friendship and Love, Juliera Emerges With a Heartfelt Single That Speaks to the Soul\nBoston, MA – Nigerian-American artist Juliera, born Opeyemi Juliet Simon, has once again captured hearts with the release of her latest single,“Lonely Without You.”The track, available now on all major streaming platforms, is a soulful exploration of the tender and often complicated dynamics between friendship and romance. More than a song, it is a story—one layered with vulnerability, strength, and emotional introspection.\nBorn on October 9, 1991, in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria, Juliera has never been one to follow a conventional path. Her upbringing in the vibrant cultural epicenter of Nigeria provided her with deep musical and spiritual roots. These roots, enriched by her transcontinental journey to Boston, Massachusetts, have become a key element in the unique musical identity that defines her work.\n“Lonely Without You” marks a major step in Juliera’s artistic evolution. With this single, she peels back layers of herself, drawing from personal experiences and universal emotions. The song opens with soft, haunting keys, quickly enveloped by airy percussion and emotive string arrangements. Her voice, raw and unfiltered, channels the aching loneliness of distance from a once-familiar connection.\nJuliera explains:“This song is about that moment when you realize your relationship is changing—when friendship and love blur into something more painful and more beautiful than you ever expected. It’s personal, but I know so many people have felt this.”\nHer background reads like a tapestry woven with both ambition and creativity. A licensed cosmetologist and successful entrepreneur, Juliera is the owner ofBow Salonin Boston’s South End—an award-winning, minority-owned beauty salon that has become a local favorite. Her ability to build community through beauty and artistry has only enhanced her music career, bringing a rare authenticity to her creative endeavors.\nBut her talents don’t stop there. Juliera is also a licensed real estate agent and a prolific ghostwriter. Since the age of 16, she has crafted lyrics and melodies for other artists across platforms such as Fiverr, Upwork, and SoundBetter. These early beginnings in ghostwriting helped her hone a lyrical sensibility that shines through in every verse of“Lonely Without You.”\nAcademically, Juliera’s accomplishments are equally impressive. She holds a Professional Diploma in Software Engineering from NIIT in Nigeria, a Diploma in Pure Mathematics from the University of Lagos, a Bachelor’s in Information Technology and Business Information Systems from Middlesex University in London, and a Graduate Certification in Business Administration from Northeastern University in Boston. This impressive résumé of achievements underpins the discipline and vision that drive her as an independent artist.\nHer musical discography continues to grow. Before“Lonely Without You,”she released other notable tracks like“Hero”and“Let It Ache,”which together have earned millions of streams. Juliera’s ability to blend African musical sensibilities with modern Western pop and R&B rhythms places her in a league of her own, appealing to a global audience that spans generations.\nSince its release,“Lonely Without You”has garnered over 111,000 streams, with listeners praising its sincerity and replay value. Critics note that it captures a timeless emotional arc that feels fresh in today’s music landscape. The production quality, coupled with her passionate vocal delivery, sets the single apart as one of her most refined and resonant works to date.\nFans and followers are encouraged to connect with Juliera on her official social media platforms—Instagram,YouTube,Facebook,Twitter, andTikTok—to stay updated on upcoming performances, music videos, and behind-the-scenes content.Juliera’s Spotifyprofile is also home to her growing catalog of deeply personal and emotionally stirring music.\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\nNew York, NY– Queens-born rapperShawny Binladenis more than a fixture in New York City’s drill scene—he’s one of its most radical innovators. With a sound that defies drill’s expected grit and fury, Shawny took a quieter, more calculated path: by reimagining the genre through the lens of sampling. Borrowing from a practice that has underpinned hip-hop since its inception, Shawny injected new life into drill by closely working with producers that flipped iconic tracks and breathing soulful nostalgia into cold, hard beats made just for him. The result was him being coined the “King Of Samples,” by way of NPR— as sample drill or soul drill, is a subgenre he and his producers creatively defined.\nFast-forward to 2025, Shawny Binladen is simply a pioneer; as many can hear the influence on a regular basis in today’s airwaves. And this summer, he’s bringing that movement to stages across the U.S. and Europe with his“Make America Grinch Again” tour.\nThe tour features none other than the Grinchset themselves, including Shawny,Four50,Big YaYa,Big Gltaow,Baby GatesandYidda Man— making‘Make America Grinch Again’a fitting title for the entire Grinchset, who’ve always done things in their own way. Along for the ride areKP Skywalka,FL3A, andPaco Panama.Other special guests will be announced along the way.\nHere’s where Shawny and the guys will be ‘Grinchin’ this summer:\n* 6/18 – Los Angeles, CA @ Moroccan Lounge\n* 6/22 – Dallas, TX  @ House of Blues – Cambridge Room\n* 6/25 – Boston, MA @ Sonia (Cambridge)\n* 6/26 – New York, NY @ Gramercy Theatre\n* 6/28 – Atlanta, GA @ Masquerade – Purgatory\n* 7/3 – Berlin, Germany @ PrivateClub\n* 7/4 – Paris, France *(Festival Appearance)*\n* 7/6 – London, England @ The Lower Third\nFor longtime fans, this is a chance to see Shawny’s sample-laced catalog come to life, and witness the Grinchset greatness as a whole.

        "description": "\nIn a cultural moment defined by disruption and transformation, one voice is cutting through the noise with a vision that’s as bold as it is necessary. Boston-native BT The Artist has launched a new genre called Progressive Music, and it’s already being hailed as more than just a musical innovation — it’s a movement.\nWith the tagline “Let an Artist Be an Artist,” BT’s Progressive Music isn’t confined by radio formulas or streaming algorithms. Instead, it blends the raw emotion of real-life stories with an eclectic mix of musical styles — from drill and hip-hop to country trap, Afrobeat, and alternative rock.\n“Music should reflect the world we live in — the chaos, the beauty, the growth, the struggle,” BT says. “Progressive Music is my way of giving artists space to tell the truth, in all its complexity.”\nAt a time when social media trends often dictate sound, BT is flipping the script. Progressive Music emphasizes substance over streams, pushing back against the notion that viral is the same as valuable. It’s music for thinkers, fighters, and dreamers — for people who want their playlists to mean something.\nIt’s also deeply personal. BT’s own journey as a Black artist from Boston shapes his music, fusing cultural pride with community urgency. “We’re dealing with racism, poverty, mental health, violence — and we still wake up every day to create. That’s what this genre honors.”\n\nTo kick off this movement, BT The Artist releases three pivotal tracks that embody the soul and spirit of Progressive Music:\nProgressive Music is also an open door. BT is calling on artists around the world — especially those who feel overlooked or boxed in — to join him.\n“There’s a lot of pressure to fit a mold in today’s industry,” he explains. “This is for the artists who don’t want to be boxed in, who feel like their voice has been muted. Progressive Music is for you.”\n\nWhat truly sets Progressive Music apart is its mission beyond the mic. BT is already in talks to partner with nonprofits focused on mental health, youth development, and racial equity. He’s using his platform to spark conversations and mobilize listeners into action.\n“Progressive Music gives us the chance to make soundtracks for change. We’re not just here to entertain — we’re here to empower,” he says.\nWith big plans for live performances, global collaborations, and community projects, BT’s vision for Progressive Music is only beginning to unfold.\n“If one kid hears a song and decides not to give up — that’s the win. If one artist stops hiding their truth — that’s the impact. This is music that matters.”\n“We don’t need permission to be powerful. Progressive Music is about freedom — creative, emotional, and cultural. I’m not waiting for the industry to catch up. I’m building something new, right now.”\n.\n\nAs Progressive Music gains momentum, BT The Artist is ready to bring his message and movement to the world. Announcing his upcoming international tour, BT will be performing live in the United States, Vietnam, Guam, Germany, and Japan. This series of performances marks the next chapter in what many are calling the BT The Artist Era.\nThe tour will not only showcase the defining sound of Progressive Music but will also deliver powerful live experiences that reflect the heart of BT’s mission—authentic storytelling, cultural unity, and global impact.\n“This tour is more than music. It’s about connection,” BT says. “Whether I’m performing in Boston or Berlin, I want every audience member to walk away feeling inspired and empowered.”\nTour dates and ticket information will be announced soon through BT’s official website and social media channels.

His latest single, “Big Flexing,” doesn’t just live up to its name—it glows in it. A luxury-laced banger with equal parts seduction and swagger, the track proves that opulence and lyricism can still coexist in modern hip-hop.\nFrom the opening notes, “Big Flexing” feels like a late-night cruise through city lights—top down, cologne in the air, and something expensive on the aux. While it nods to the timeless allure ofJay-ZandUGK’s“Big Pimpin,”J.Crowndoesn’t copy the blueprint—he upgrades it. The result is a slick, grown-man anthem that glides as effortlessly as a Rolls-Royce on a freshly paved road.\nThe hook is tailor-made for replay, social captions, and bedroom soundtracks alike:\n“I’m doing big flexing / Spending bands / Check it out now…”\nIt’s bold, but smooth—like a toast whispered across a penthouse suite.\n\nAnd while the chorus will get stuck in your head, it’s in the verses whereJ.Crownreally makes his mark. With flirtatious bars like “You so fine I’ll be there at 9” and “Come through in something see-through or something kinky medieval,” he paints cinematic moments that blend intimacy with indulgence. It’s courtship with no budget cap.\nRaised between Fort Greene, Brooklyn and Lagos, Nigeria,J.Crowncarries the balance of two worlds—streetwise and jet-set, grounded and global. That duality is baked into “Big Flexing.” It’s not just about having money—it’s about having taste. The track isn’t here to scream wealth—it seduces you into it.\nWhether it’s playing during an after-hours link-up, filling the silence in a dimly lit lounge, or looping in the background of a sultry IG story, “Big Flexing” fits. It’s for the women who know their value and the men who match it without asking questions.\nJ.Crownisn’t flexing just to show off. He’s flexing with purpose. And in this game, that’s the biggestflexof all.\n© 2025,deblazeo. All rights reserved.",

Grandiose’s own music, much like his idols’, taps into a full spectrum of emotions—aiming not just to entertain but to heal. His mission is to make people feel good, understood, and seen through his music.\n“My goal is to make my listeners vibe—I want to make them feel good,” he shares in his press note.

But like many parents who’ve experienced the entertainment world’s ups and downs, Verlin hesitated.\n“I told him to come back in two years if he still felt the same,” Verlin recalls. “He never forgot.”\nTrue to his word, at age five, King returned and asked again — this time with even more conviction. Ivette, having overheard the original conversation, reminded Verlin of his promise. As a father committed to teaching his sons integrity, he knew what had to come next: it was time to get to work.\nFrom that day forward, the Moore family committed themselves to helping King chase his dream. Ivette left her job to focus full-time on his training. Together, they invested deeply in King’s development — acting classes, vocal coaching, piano lessons, gymnastics, and countless hours in the studio. They traveled from state to state, giving King every opportunity to perform, grow, and be seen.\nMuch of King’s early inspiration came from watching icons like Michael Jackson, Chris Brown, Bruno Mars, and Justin Bieber on YouTube and TV — dreams sparked by an iPad gifted one Christmas. Those early influences planted seeds that are now beginning to bloom.\nNow 9 years old, King Moore has already started building an impressive résumé. He’s had small roles in feature films including Cora Bora, The Wild Robot, and CoComelon (as Cody). His face has graced national commercials for AT&T and Toyota. He’s appeared twice on the Tamron Hall Show (ABC/Disney), as well as the Portia Bruner Show (Fox). He’s toured with stars like That Girl Lay Lay, Kenan Thompson, Young Dylan, and Heiress Harris, and even co-hosted alongside Nick Cannon at the 2025 Honda Battle of the Bands at SoFi Stadium.\nKing also holds the distinction of being the youngest ambassador for the Black College Expo and the youngest child entertainer invited to the White House under the Biden-Harris administration. There, he spoke on gun violence prevention, reminding the nation: “Kids make up 50% of the population, but we’re 100% of the future.”\nNow, one of King’s biggest dreams — performing in front of the world on America’s Got Talent — has come true. The journey is far from over, but it’s a milestone moment for a boy who dared to dream — and the parents who believed in him enough to help make it a reality.\nFollow King Moore’s journey as it unfolds on America’s Got Talent this season.\nStay Connected:https://linktr.ee/kingmoore1\n© 2025,MysticsEnt.

        "title": "Deangelo Breuer Stakes His Claim with Gritty, Emotional Album ALL OR NOTHING",
        "description": "\nLos Angeles-based rapper and producerDeangelo Breueris not following the industry playbook—and that’s exactly what makes him stand out. With the release of his second studio album,ALL OR NOTHING, Breuer cements himself as one of the most emotionally raw and creatively fearless new voices in hip-hop.\nOriginally hailing from Long Beach, Deangelo officially entered the music industry in 2023. While his early SoundCloud demos have since been archived, they served as a blueprint for his evolving sound—one that blends dark, cinematic production with unfiltered storytelling. His lyrics pull no punches, often dealing with mental health struggles, betrayal, and the relentless grind of personal growth in an unforgiving business.\nThe new album,ALL OR NOTHING, lives up to its name. Each track feels like a deep dive into Breuer’s psyche, layered over atmospheric beats and raw percussion. It’s a bold, vulnerable project that shows he’s willing to risk everything to say something real. The album features production from Deangelo himself, along with collaborators The Everyday and Maxine Helmsmen. The trackLit Like This, co-produced with The Everyday, adds a genre-blurring energy that pushes the boundaries of traditional rap.\n\nDeangelo first caught wider attention withFalse Dreams, a single that crossed 70,000 streams on Spotify—an impressive milestone for an independent artist. He followed it withDancing With The Devil, a heavy, emotionally intense track that still managed to reach over 30,000 streams, proving that authenticity resonates even when the music doesn’t fit neatly into commercial boxes.\nHis growth is organic, driven by word-of-mouth and consistent output. You won’t find high-budget videos just yet—Breuer has instead focused on DIY visuals and single cover content, using every tool available to connect with his audience. You can streamALL OR NOTHINGnow onSpotify.\nWhat sets Deangelo apart isn’t just the music—it’s the mission. Beyond his own releases, he’s also working behind the scenes to support emerging talent under his informal label and production umbrella. For him, building something real is more important than chasing industry approval. “I give more to others than the industry will ever give me back,” he says. “But that’s not the point. I’m here to create something that lasts.”\nDeangelo’s Instagram feed offers a behind-the-scenes look at the journey, showcasing both his creative process and day-to-day grind. Follow him onInstagramfor updates, studio clips, and unreleased previews.\nFor a full overview of his catalog, brand, and upcoming releases, visit hisLinktree.\nWithALL OR NOTHING, Deangelo Breuer isn’t just releasing music—he’s delivering a manifesto. It’s raw, unfiltered, and true to the core. In a landscape where realness is often filtered out, Breuer is here to remind us what vulnerability sounds like when you put everything on the line.\nStream now\nhttps://deangelo.lnk.to/ALLORNOTHING\n© 2025,Tedfuel.

        "description": "\n\nMemphis emcee Lukah and legendary DJ/producer Statik Selektah have joined forces with Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Killer Mike for their powerful new single, “South Still Speaking.” The track is the second single from their upcoming collaborative album, A Lost Language Found, set for release on June 20, 2025 via Perfect Time Music Group.\nProduced entirely by Statik Selektah, A Lost Language Found explores the rich and complex heritage of Southern Black culture, with a particular focus on the voices and linguistic traditions of Memphis. The project highlights seven distinct “languages” present within these communities — languages that have often been stripped away or historically overlooked.\nIn addition to Killer Mike, the album boasts an all-star lineup of guest features, including Jay Worthy, 8Ball, Bun B, Termanology, and more.\nKnown for his raw lyricism and incisive social commentary, Lukah has emerged as one of the most vital and uncompromising voices in modern hip-hop. Raised in South Memphis amid gang culture, Lukah found inspiration through his parents and local legends like Playa Fly and DJ Paul. A pivotal moment came in middle school when he first heard Crucial Conflict’s “Hay,” igniting a lifelong commitment to creating music with meaning and depth.\nLukah’s 2021 album, When the Black Hand Touches You, marked a turning point, fearlessly tackling themes of systemic oppression and generational trauma. His follow-up, Why Look Up, God’s in the Mirror, continued to push boundaries, focusing on personal accountability and self-reflection. Beyond the mic, Lukah mentors youth in Memphis and works to bridge the gap between the underground and mainstream scenes. As a father, he uses his platform to break cycles of trauma and inspire change.\nStatik Selektah, meanwhile, remains a towering figure in East Coast hip-hop. Renowned for his role in shaping the mixtape era and breaking regional acts, Selektah has produced for G-Unit, AZ, and Joell Ortiz, and collaborated with legends like Nas, Q-Tip, and John Legend. His solo discography includes classics such as Spell My Name Right (2007), Stick 2 the Script (2008), and 100 Proof: The Hangover (2010).\nHe’s also celebrated for his collaborative projects with artists including Bun B (TrillStatik), Curren$y (Gran Turismo), and Freddie Gibbs (Lord Giveth, Lord Taketh Away). His 2020 release, The Balancing Act, featured heavy hitters such as Nas and Method Man.\nWith A Lost Language Found, Lukah and Statik Selektah aim to craft a body of work that is both culturally resonant and sonically compelling — honoring the past while forging a new path for Southern hip-hop.\nSTREAM ‘SOUTH STILL SPEAKING’ ONLINEHERE\n© 2025,StanleyGatero.

        "description": "\n\n\nParis-born and of Senegalese descent, rising artist Bocar continues to make a name for himself in the Afropop landscape with the release of his latest single, “TIME.” Known for blending Afrohouse, R&B, and soulful textures rooted in his heritage, Bocar’s sound is as global as it is personal—rhythmic, emotionally resonant, and undeniably catchy.\nFollowing previous standout tracks like “ONLY,” “FREE,” and the Ne-Yo-praised “Enough,” “TIME” marks another bold step forward in Bocar’s growing catalogue. The track is a sleek, summertime anthem layered with ethereal synths, watery keys, and warm, pulsating basslines. His smooth, expressive vocals glide over the production with ease, building from entrancing verses into a hook that lingers long after the song ends.\nWhat sets Bocar apart isn’t just the quality of his recordings, but the immersive experience he creates around his music. His high-energy live shows—complete with choreographed dance—amplify the emotional and rhythmic pulse of his sound, connecting audiences across languages and cultures.\n“TIME” encapsulates Bocar’s gift for marrying melody with mood. With its hypnotic rhythm and introspective tone, it’s a track that feels both light and grounded, designed for movement but built for replay.

Raised in Australia with roots in Burundi, Stevan brings both a global and deeply personal perspective to his eclectic sound.

        "description": "SNACKTIMEisn’t just a band — it’s a feeling. And on the Mann stage at Roots Picnic 2025, that feeling hit like a sonic wave. The horns were heavy, the rhythm was alive, and the energy was undeniable. Watching them in action, it’s hard to believe it all started five years ago… in the streets of Philadelphia.Yesseh Furaha-Ali(vocals, alto sax, percussion),Sam Gellerstein(sousaphone),Austin Marlow(drums),Larry Monroe Jr.(guitar),Eric Sherman(trumpet, guitar),Michael Spearman(trombone, keyboard), andBen Stocker(tenor sax). The band also features a rotating cast of instrumentalists who join for different performances.\n\nPhoto By: Bob Sweeney\nI got to sit down with a few members of the band and get to know them a little more. I asked “How did you guys come together to create a sound that’s so in sync?” Gellerstein answered, “We really got lucky….We’re lucky to get a group of guys who were able to operate on the same wavelength and feed off of each other’s energies and song knowledge.” What began as a street performance experiment during the pandemic has since grown into a full-fledged musical movement.\nBefore the band became a touring force, Sam had already started a special event series also called Snacktime in 2019. It was a space to spotlight lesser-known artists and local chefs. “It was awesome,” he says as he reflected on a great memory.\nNow, the group’s journey has taken them from Philly sidewalks to mountain tops — literally. Their cross country tour alongside acts likePortugal. The Man, andKarl Densonopened new doors. Michael shared they’ll soon be heading on tour withFitz and the TantrumsinAugust. And while the heights (both musical and physical) can be intimidating, SNACKTIME keeps it grounded.\n“There’s nothing to fear as long as you’re doing what you love,”Yessehtold HHS87, asBoots on the Groundplays behind him. “Gotta stay ten toes,” he adds, slapping a size 10 boot onto the table with a grin. “Stay firm in what you believe.”\nPhoto by: Ben Sweeney\nIt’s that mix of confidence, camaraderie, and contagious joy that makes SNACKTIME so magnetic. “We’re a band of brothers,” Yesseh shares candidly. “We love the music and we love each other. If you continue to love what you do and the people you’re surrounded by, good things will happen.”\nWhen asked what his favorite part of performing with SNACKTIME is,Nico Bryant(vocals) doesn’t hesitate. “I’m a lover of music and I’m a fan of SNACKTIME. I’m here by the grace of God. I don’t think too much about the notes I have to hit. I just let it flow and trust in what we rehearsed.” He admits that as performing artists much of their focus is to create an unforgettable experience for their fans.  “No matter what I may be going through. It’s about love and unity when using the stage as a release to uplift others. If one person is touched by that, we’ve done our job.”\nSNACKTIME’s set atRoots Picnic 2025was more than a performance — it was a reminder of what can happen when passion, purpose, and community come together. From street corners to festival stages, their journey is still unfolding, but one thing’s for sure: their sound is rooted in love, lifted by brotherhood, and made to move people — BOOTS and soul. lol\n\n© 2025,Siani Leigh.

Whether it’s the flags in the background, the slang in his verses, or the loyalty to his block, his Dominican roots are not just present—they’re powerful. It’s that same cultural pride and authenticity that’s made him a voice of the people, especially for young Latino creatives looking to carve their own lane.\n“Bad Boyz” follows the intense “Reservoir Dogs” featuring K-Prez, and the lyrical barrage of “Mazerati Freestyle”, rounding out a trilogy of visuals all directed by Quentin Filmz—whose eye for storytelling has become a signature part of Kiamo’s rollout.\nBeyond A Malcolm Story, Kiamo also recently dropped the final chapter in his acclaimed series with “Omertà 3: The Midtown Story”—a raw and uncut tribute to his city. The project features Jay EBK, Funeral, Midtown June, Guala, CJ 2.18, and Hov & also helping artist distribute their music through his distribution deal with Rocnation. Kiamo recently was involved with Zeenie’s release for “My Story”, Shee Bang “Good Ol Days” & Focus Frqncy “Falling For You”. Kiamo’s commitment to platforming local talent remains at the center of everything he builds.\nFrom the corners of Passaic to the rhythms of the Dominican diaspora, Kiamo isn’t just releasing music—he’s creating moments. Bad Boyz is the latest example of how storytelling, cultural identity, and cinematic vision can all live in the same breath.\n\n© 2025,Logan. All rights reserved.",

        "description": "\nEveryoneLovesIce—stylized as one word but often searched as “Everyone Loves Ice”—drops one of the year’s most personal West Coast records with “The Introduction,” released under the rising L.A. imprint Luxurious Entertainment and distributed by Roc Nation.\nYou ever hear a track that feels less like a song and more like somebody handing you their life story?\nThat’s exactly what you get from this South Central-bred MC—a name you might not know yet, but one you won’t forget after pressing play.\nThere’s no hook. No auto-tuned anthem. Just raw bars over a haunting West Coast bounce, as Ice lays out decades of street history—some of it lived, some of it survived. He speaks on his brother’s past with the infamous Jamaican Posse, the moves made by L.A. godfather Harry-O, and his late-night spiritual conversations with respected West Coast producer Tone Toven. Every bar lands heavy, not because it’s loud—but because it’s true.\nIce doesn’t rap for attention. He raps to document. To preserve. To show people what really shaped him. One of the most telling moments in his journey? 50 Cent once acknowledged his hustle—not his music, his hustle. That respect hits different when it’s coming from another grinder.\nDiscovered by music mogul and community activist Big U (currently facing a RICO case), Ice came up on both sides of the industry. From underground tape circuits to tours where he rocked crowds of thousands, this isn’t image—it’s lived experience.\n“The Introduction” marks more than just a single—it’s the start of a focused rollout from Luxurious Entertainment that puts real storytelling front and center. If you’ve been craving something grounded, something with purpose—this is it.\nAnd he’s just getting warmed up. EveryoneLovesIce’s next drops include “Pray For Me” (feat. Dedge P & Classmaticc), “Put It Up” (feat. San Quinn, Feezy LeBron & Yhung TO), and “Keep It Westside” (feat. Young Buck, Crip Mac & Snoopy Badazz).\n“The Introduction” is streaming now on all platforms. And if you really know what’s good for your algorithm, go follow @EveryoneLovesIce.\nThis ain’t the beginning. It’s just the part where you catch up.\nListen + Tap In:▶️ Spotify:https://open.spotify.com/track/7cIkbUnw3a8QfWr9pFDzme?si=64b8800aa2fe407a🌐 Website:www.EveryoneLovesIce.com📲 Instagram:@EveryoneLovesIce🏷 Label:LuxuriousEntertainment.com📡 Label IG: @Luxurious.Entertainment / Roc Nation Distribution\n© 2025,Logan.

His new album,REALiTY, showcases his lyrical evolution, but it also signals something bigger: the rise of a mogul in motion.\nWhileREALiTYcements TruthWhy’s place as a top-tier lyricist, it’s also a companion piece to a larger narrative—one of ownership, entrepreneurship, and elevation.

You can build both.\nTruthWhy’s recentRocNationdistribution deal is a power play, opening doors without compromising independence.

Together, these brands reflect the album’s ethos: elevate your lifestyle while staying grounded in your truth.\nEach business move is intentional. Each brand tells a story.

TruthWhy is living the blueprint that so many artists talk about but rarely execute. He’s not just chasing wealth—he’s creating ecosystem wealth, turning every bar and business move into a brick toward generational success.\nBeyond personal gain, TruthWhy’s vision includes the community. From mentoring young artists to spotlighting underrepresented entrepreneurs through his platforms, he’s lifting as he climbs. His story proves that you don’t need industry permission to become the industry. You just need vision, strategy, and the courage to bet on yourself.\nREALiTYmight be the album title, but it’s also the mission statement: face your truth, build your empire, and leave no piece of your purpose untouched. In a culture that often separates art from ambition, TruthWhy is bridging the gap—and setting a new standard in the process. So while others are rapping for clout, TruthWhy is building for the culture. And the business of bars? He’s already mastered it. Don’t believe it?

        "description": "ITSBIZKIT is back with another major move, linking up with Texas rap star Sauce Walka for the official “Blood Money” remix video, which premiered exclusively on WorldStarHipHop. Following the viral success of the original track’s After Hours Show performance in NYC, this remix levels up the energy, with Sauce Walka adding his animated, bar-heavy presence to the street anthem.\nThe video, filmed and edited by SocialMediaHouse Productions, captures the raw essence of both artists. From gritty cuts to bold scenes of flexing and boss talk, the visual matches the hunger and authenticity the song represents.\n\nThis release also comes in the midst of real-life tragedy and triumph for Sauce Walka. The Houston rapper was recently shot in the leg in Memphis, an incident that tragically took the life of his TSF artist, Sayso P. Despite the tragedy, Sauce isn’t slowing down. In fact, he just inked a $250k deal with RPM and is gearing up to release a joint album with fellow TSF artist 44 Mike Deezy—keeping his label and legacy moving forward.\nAs for ITSBIZKIT, the Long Island native continues to prove he’s more than just a media figure. Whether it’s breaking viral records or collaborating with heavyweights, he’s carving out his own lane as an artist and tastemaker.\n“Blood Money” remix now available across all major DSPs.\n© 2025,deblazeo.

        "title": "Kee Nola Drops Viral Video “Party Girl”",
        "description": "Kee Nola’s Party Girl captures the emotional wreckage of loving someone lost in a world of excess. The song’s narrator wrestles with the chaos of a relationship where partying and substance use take priority over genuine connection. Lines like “Swerving off the drugs causing mayhem / I can’t shake the demons goddamn” reflect the turbulence of loving a person consumed by self-destruction. The recurring hook, “Cause I gave my heart to a party girl,” echoes with regret, underscoring the pain of investing in someone emotionally unavailable.\nThe track drips with melancholy, a sonic confession of unreciprocated love and the struggle to maintain self-worth in a one-sided dynamic. Kee Nola’s delivery is steeped in raw vulnerability, making the song feel like a late-night confession whispered into the void. The production, driven by moody melodies and immersive beats, mirrors the emotional weight of the lyrics.\nMusically, Party Girl leans into the melodic rap style pioneered by artists like Juice WRLD. That influence has fueled conversations about Kee Nola’s artistic identity. Some listeners praise the familiar sound, while others question whether he brings enough originality to the genre. The debate plays out on platforms like Reddit, where one user observed, “He sounds almost identical to Juice WRLD… makes the same types/genre of music as Juice and looks/gives off Juice vibes but claims he’s just a fan.”\nDespite these discussions, Party Girl has carved out space on platforms like TikTok and Spotify, where its themes of love, loss, and self-destruction resonate deeply. The song’s unfiltered emotion and introspective lyricism strike a chord with listeners navigating their own heartbreak. Whether embraced as homage or critiqued for its similarities, Kee Nola’s Party Girl is undeniably compelling—an anthem for those caught between love and self-preservation.\n\n© 2025,deblazeo.

        "title": "Rising Dancehall Queen Tina Dimples Makes Impact with “Rich” Single",
        "description": "\nIn the ever-evolving world of dancehall music, few artists manage to capture both the essence of tradition and the pulse of innovation. One such rising star is Tina Dimples, an artist whose unique sound and undeniable charisma set her apart from the rest. With a passion for the culture and a vision for the future, Tina Dimples is poised to make a significant impact on the global music scene.\nBorn with the name Ikena, Tina Dimples’ stage name carries a special significance. “Friends and family call me ‘Kena’ (K-ee-n-a) for short, but when I introduce myself, people often mishear it as ‘Tina.’ Given my big, beautiful dimples and my admiration for the legendary Tina Turner, the name ‘Tina Dimples’ naturally stuck,” she explains. This moniker perfectly encapsulates her vibrant personality and powerful stage presence.\nTina Dimples’ music is deeply rooted in the dancehall tradition, yet it extends beyond regional boundaries. “My target audience consists mostly of Caribbean nations and diaspora communities worldwide, but I’m always eager to connect with anyone who appreciates dancehall vibes,” she says. Her ability to infuse dancehall rhythms with other genres allows her to appeal to a broad and diverse audience.\nIn a genre often dominated by male artists, Tina Dimples stands tall as a strong female artist who remains true to the culture. “I strive to be a music ambassador for female artists globally, and my ability to blend my dancehall cadence with multiple genres makes me unique,” she asserts. This versatility, combined with her commitment to authenticity, distinguishes her from her peers.\nNew Music on Streaming PlatformsFans have a major reason to be excited—TinaDimples recently released her highly anticipated single, Rich. The track, recorded at Audio Traxxx studio in Jamaica and produced by Year One Studio in upstate New York, showcases her dynamic artistry. “Dimples Production also co-produced the single, making it a true representation of my sound and vision,” she shares.\nTinaDimples lives by a powerful quote: “Heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, but they while their companions slept were toiling upward through the night.” This belief fuels her relentless work ethic and drive for success. She draws inspiration from legendary artists such as Lady Saw (now Marian Hall), Buju Banton, Spice, Vybz Kartel, Bob Marley, Whitney Houston, and Michael Jackson, among others.\nThe State of the Industry and a Call for ChangeWhile Tina Dimples believes the music industry is thriving, she acknowledges that challenges persist. “Sexism in the industry needs to end. Female artists should not be viewed as mere sex symbols but given equal opportunities to thrive on their talent alone,” she states. Additionally, she advocates for more accessible platforms for truly talented artists to gain recognition and success.\nLooking ahead, Tina Dimples hopes to collaborate with industry heavyweights such as Valiant, Shenseea, Christopher Martin, Dexta Daps, Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, Sean Paul, Shaggy, Nicki Minaj, and Rihanna. She also aspires to work with renowned producers like Russian, Javy Ambassador, Jordan, DJ Mac, and Steven “Di Genius.”\nBeyond Music: Personal InterestsWhen she’s not making music, Tina Dimples enjoys films like The Harder They Come, Game of Thrones, and The Twilight Saga. Her favorite book? The Bible. She also reflects on common misconceptions about her personality. “People often think I’m too cute, shy, and humble to be a hardcore DJ, but I love proving them wrong on stage,” she says with a smile.\nFor Tina Dimples, performing live is a magical experience. “My favorite part of my shows is the interaction with the audience—capturing their full attention and giving them the ultimate Tina Dimples experience,” she shares. She believes that the next few months will mark a significant evolution in her stage performances.\nUpcoming EP and Album PlansFans can also look forward to a fusion of reggae and dancehall in her upcoming EP or album. “It will be a project that kids, young adults, and grown folks alike can enjoy without discomfort—just pure good vibes and timeless music,” she promises.\nTina Dimples leaves her supporters with a powerful message: “Never give up on your dreams. Stay focused, trust God, and remember that success is built through hard work and dedication.” With her unstoppable drive and undeniable talent, Tina Dimples is a name the world will soon know and celebrate.\nFor more updates and music, visittinadimplesmusic.com\n\n© 2025,Logan.

        "description": "\nHipHopsince1987 is proud to present an exclusive interview with Jahkidd, the rising rapper who’s been making waves in the music industry. From his recent feature on Shade 45 with DJ KaySlay to his new single “Have You Ever,” Jahkidd opens up about his journey, his experiences, and what’s next for this talented artist.\nQuestion 1: Shade 45 Experience\nHipHopsince1987:Jahkidd, congratulations on being featured on Shade 45 with DJ KaySlay! That’s a huge accomplishment, especially since Shade 45 is Eminem’s satellite radio station. Can you take us through your experience? What was it like being in the Shade 45 studio, and how did the interview with DJ KaySlay go?\nJahkidd:Man, it was an incredible experience! Walking into the Shade 45 studio was surreal. I’m a huge fan of Eminem, and to be on his platform was a dream come true. The energy in the studio was electric, and DJ KaySlay was super cool and down-to-earth. He asked me some great questions, and we had a real conversation about my music, my background, and my goals. It felt like a real dialogue, not just a scripted Q&A. The whole experience was motivating and inspiring – it made me feel like I’m on the right path.\n\nQuestion 2: Independent Success\nHipHopsince1987:You’ve managed to gain significant attention in the music industry without any major label support or sponsorships. That’s impressive, especially considering your background and the fact that you’re doing everything on your own. Can you talk about your work ethic and what drives you to keep pushing forward?\nJahkidd:Yeah, it’s been a tough journey, but I’ve always been driven by my passion for music and my desire to make a better life for myself and my loved ones. Growing up in poverty, I knew I had to work hard to achieve my goals. I’ve put in countless hours honing my craft, networking, and promoting myself. It’s not easy, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to succeed. My work ethic is rooted in my determination to never go back to where I came from. I want to create a better future for myself and inspire others to do the same.\nNew Music: “Have You Ever”\nHipHopsince1987:Your new single “Have You Ever” is out now. Can you tell us a bit about the song and what inspired you to create it?\nJahkidd:“Have You Ever” is a very personal song that reflects on my experiences growing up in poverty and facing adversity. I wanted to create a song that people could relate to, something that would resonate with those who’ve been through similar struggles. The song is about perseverance, hope, and the importance of never giving up on your dreams. I’m really proud of how it turned out, and I hope it inspires listeners to keep pushing forward, no matter what challenges they’re facing.\n\nWith his Shade 45 feature and new single “Have You Ever,” Jahkidd is undoubtedly making waves in the music industry. His determination, work ethic, and passion for music are inspiring, and we can’t wait to see what’s next for this talented artist.\nStay Connected\nFollow:\nNew Song Just Released-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR2pwDMDp3w\nFacebook-https://www.facebook.com/share/1AEvPv1dSu/\nInstagram-https://www.instagram.com/jahkidd4dabidd\n© 2025,Logan.
