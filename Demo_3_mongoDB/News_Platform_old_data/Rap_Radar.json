He was 54 years-old.\nThe tragic news was confirmed on Wednesday (Feb. 4), but a cause of death has not been reported. The late music mogul had recently battled health issues involving a number of strokes in recent years and diabetes-related issues.\nBorn Irving Lorenzo Jr., the Queens-native played a pivotal role in hip-hop and R&B music in the 90s working with superstars including Ja Rule, Ashanti, JAY-Z, the late DMX, and many more. Gotti helped bring some of the artists over to Def Jam Records, before launching his very own Murder Inc. Records, later rebrand to The Inc., under the Def Jam umbrella. There, Irv helped spawned endless hits with his artists Ja Rule and Ashanti, and many others artists from JAY-Z, DMX and Jennifer Lopez to Christina Milian, Alicia Keys, and Eve.\nIn the mid-20s, he and brother and Murder Inc. Records co-founder Chris Gotti were investigated by the FBI for alleged ties to drug kingpin Kenneth \u201cSupreme\u201d McGriff.\u00a0Charged with money laundering, the Lorenzos were both acquitted.\nIn his most recent years, Gotti relaunched Murder Inc., under his new label, Visionary and partnering with 300 Ent. Irv also released his BET series,Tales, a scripted anthology series of \u201csong stories,\u201d which used hip hop songs to create mini-movies out of the lyrics.\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to Irv Gotti\u2019s family and friends during this difficult time.\nPhotos:Evan Pierce",

After three weeks on trial, rapper A$AP Rocky was found not guilty in his highly-publicized trail for felony assault, which involved a shooting nearly four years ago.\nA$AP Rocky, born Rakim Meyers, jumped in joy and leaped into his girlfriend Rihanna\u2019s arms after the verdict was revealed on Tuesday (Feb. 18) at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in Los Angeles.\nThe 36-year-old rapper was facing up to 24 years in prison. He pleaded not guilty earlier this year by turning down a prosecution offer of just six months in jail, along with probation and other conditions, if he would have plead guilty to one count.\nA$AP Rocky was facing two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, from the 2021 shooting incident in Los Angeles with former friend, A$AP Relli.\nRocky and Relli were involved in a physical altercation in Hollywood on November 6, 2021, which lead Rocky firing his firearm twice. Relli said one of the shots grazed his knuckle but was not seriously hurt.\nThe defense argued that Rocky shot a prop gun that he was carrying for security and he only fired it as a warning shot during the physical altercation.\n\u201cRelli is an angry pathological liar, who committed perjury again and again and again and again, \u201d said A$AP Rocky\u2019s attorney Joe Tacopina. \u201cThey saw through this mirage of a case. He turned down a plea for almost no jail time because he was innocent,\u201d added Tacopina.\n\u201cThank y\u2019all for saving my life,\u201d A$AP Rocky told members of the jury as he was leaving the court room. While mobbed by the press outside, Rocky added, \u201cThis whole experience has been crazy for the past 4 years.

        "description": "Words & Photos by Ismail Sayeed\u00a0|@Calligrafist\nThis year marked the fifth and final Dreamville Fest\u2014an unforgettable sendoff to the best artist-run festival in the game. Held in Raleigh, NC, the lineup was stacked, the energy was unmatched, and the city came alive with incredible activations all weekend long.\nAs someone who was there for Year 1 and now Year 5, it felt full circle. Back in 2019, Rap Radar Podcast landed a legendary interview with J. Cole after his performance. Now in 2025, to return and tell the visual stories of the festival\u2019s final run? Dope AF.\nDay 1 Highlights:Ab-Soul brought out JID during his set, Bas announced a new album, and Ari Lennox blessed the stage with that signature soul her fans love. Ludacris reminded everyone why he\u2019s a certified legend, and the night closed with a rare, iconic reunion: Lil Wayne, Birdman, Mannie Fresh, and the Hot Boys running through classics and deep cuts. Watching all of them share a stage was the moment I\u2019d been waiting to photograph\u2014and it delivered.\nDay 2 Highlights:BIGXThaPlug lit up the stage with presence and bars, EarthGang and JID brought raw energy and lyricism, and Coco Jones was pure magic\u2014one of those sets youdon\u2019tmiss. Wale, rocking exclusive BAPE and\u00a0Nikes, showcased his hit-filled catalog\u00a0and why he\u2019s\u00a0one of the best showmen\u00a0in the game, while GloRilla and Tems held it down for the ladies. Glo had the crowd turned up, and Tems owned the stage with poise and beauty. Erykah Badu? A Queen, period. She captivated the crowd with her eyes, voice, and essence\u2014then later surprised us all during J. Cole\u2019s headlining set.\nCole closed the curtain on Dreamville Fest with a performance that felt deeply personal and free. The stage was designed like Muhammad\u2019s\u00a0Crib,\u00a0and he took us through his deep cuts for the Day 1s\u2014reminding the crowd who he does this for\u2014while still giving love to the Day 2s and 3s. He reflected on the end of the fest as we know it, but\u00a0spoke about\u00a0a new era\u00a0still to come. When Badu joined him on stage, the energy shifted\u2014it was spiritual, yet energetic.\nThis wasn\u2019t just another music weekend. This was the finale of somethinggreat\u2014a legacy built by artists, for the culture. Dreamville Fest may be done, but what it gave us will live forever.",

Day 1 was rough \u2014 heavy rain, long delays, and poor communication meant many people missed major performances after set times were pushed back by hours. Understandably, the crowd\u2019s experience took a hit.\nThat said, the music still delivered.\nMaxwell\u00a0closed the night like a true young elder, still smooth and powerful.\u00a0Musiq Soulchild\u00a0took us back with a full performance of hisAijuswanaseingalbum, celebrating 25 years.\u00a0Miguel\u00a0braved the rain with a set you didn\u2019t want to miss.\u00a0Latto\u00a0and\u00a0GloRilla\u00a0held it down for the ladies, and\u00a0Elmiene\u00a0brought a soulful calm to the storm. Sadly, I missed\u00a0Tems\u00a0and\u00a0Jeezy\u00a0due to the weather and set changes.\nDay 2 brought sunshine and a completely different vibe \u2014 from jump rope competitions to bold fashion and a parade of legends.\nMeek Mill\u00a0shut it down with a Philly-rooted set, monologues and all, bringing out\u00a0Fridayy,\u00a0Skrilla, and of course closing with \u201cDreams and Nightmares.\u201d\u00a0Lenny Kravitz\u00a0lit up the stage with unmatched energy.\u00a0Kaytranada\u00a0turned the park into a dance club.\u00a0J. Period\u2019s Live Mixtape\u00a0with\u00a0Pusha T,\u00a0No Malice,\u00a02 Chainz, and\u00a0Black Thought\u00a0was pure hip-hop magic.\u00a0Adam Blackstone\u00a0brought out\u00a0Jagged Edge\u00a0and\u00a0Total\u00a0for a dose of R&B nostalgia, and\u00a0DJ Diamond Kuts\u00a0kept the crowd moving all weekend, bringing out\u00a0Freeway\u00a0and\u00a0Beanie Sigel\u00a0for a proper hometown moment.\nAll in all \u2014musically, it was dope; logistically, not so much. But big love to the Roots Picnic team \u2014 here\u2019s to a smoother, sunnier year next time.",
