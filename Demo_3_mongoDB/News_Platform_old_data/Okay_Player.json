        "description": "Eminem’spublisher is taking Meta to court, but Eminem himself is not directly involved in the lawsuit.CBS Newsreportsthat the rap superstar’s publishing company, Eight Mile Style, has filed a $109 million copyright lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Michigan againstMark Zuckerberg’s social media company. Eight Mile Style is accusing Meta of using 243 songs across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp without permission.\n\"Despite their not being licensed, the recordings of the Eight Mile Compositions have been reproduced and synchronized with visual content on Meta’s platforms across millions of videos, which have been viewed billions of times.\" reads the lawsuit. \"Meta has also created online tools within their services, such as Original Audio and Reels Remix, which allow and encourage its users to steal Eight Mile Style’s music from another user’s posted audiovisual content and then use it in their own subsequent videos without proper attribution or license, resulting in exponential infringement.\"\nThe lawsuit alleges that Meta has known it needs a license to reproduce and distribute Eminem’s music. Meta entered into a license agreement with Audiam, a digital music royalty collection firm, in 2020. Back then, Meta unsuccessfully negotiated an Eight Mile Style license as part of the Audiam license.Meta has responded witha statement.\"Meta has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and an extensive global licensing program for music on its platforms. Meta had been negotiating in good faith with Eight Mile Style, but rather than continue those discussions, Eight Mile Style chose to sue.\"Eight Mile Style is seeking $150,000 for each song used without permission and for each platform where Meta made those songs available. The suit also requests a court order to stop the company from further using its songs.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Meta has known it needs a license to reproduce and distribute Eminem’s music.

        "description": "Nicki Minajis gracing thecover ofVogue Italiaand the rap superstar talked a bit about her next studio album. Minaj hasn’t dropped an album since2023sPink Friday 2and she’s been relatively quiet thus far in 2025. But according to the superstar from Queens, she’s taking her time putting this project together.\n“I’ve got a bunch of really strong tracks, but I don’t want to rush,” Nicki explained. “I want the record to mean something, both for the fans and for me. I’ll never be one of those people who puts out songs just to put them out. I love music. I respect it.”\nAnd after the success of The Pink Friday 2 World Tour, she says she will be hitting the road again. “To experience it all again, as soon as possible. For me, and for the Barbz,” she said.\nIn the interview, Nicki also talked about motherhood and her 5-year old son.\n“As a woman, I put off becoming a mother,” she shares. “A lot of women in the industry, especially older than me, haven't had children. Some don't regret it, but others do. I put it off. And then I didn't go to every Thanksgiving, Christmas or birthday party because I had to work to support my family. I think the price was not having a ‘normal’ life.\n“Today, things are different, because I can give my son what I couldn't have,” she continues. “ But there are things I would like to ensure for him and that I have to figure out how to give him. When we go out, for example, I have to worry about someone taking pictures of him. So every day I have to decide: is it more important to go for a walk with my son or to avoid him being photographed?”\nFor Nicki, the fans motivate her, but she acknowledges that the public doesn’t realize how hard she works and how much her team puts in.\n“A superstar is a superstar,” she says. “And if you are, you’ll find a way to shine, with or without social media, which like all tools can be used for good or bad. What I feel is that sometimes, today, artists don’t realize how important the record label is. They don’t realize how much goes on behind the scenes, it all seems easy.”",

        "description": "Dave Chappellesat down with fellow comedianMo Amerfor a one-on-one interview as part ofVariety’s “Actors On Actors” series. In the interview, Chappelle admits that he wasn’t especially prepared for his first time hostingSaturday Night Live.\n“The first one especially was winging it,” Chappelle reveals. “But I’ve been doing it long enough that you’re never really winging it. Even if I don’t have jokes, I gotexperienceenough. But on live television, it’s dangerous. You got to navigate standards and practices and all the rest of it. But to Lorne Michaels’ credit, he never knows what I’m going to say. As a tradition, I never do my actual monologue in rehearsal.\n“For me, rehearsal is just ‘How’s the sound?’” he explains. “It’s so much pressure on live television. But the joy of doing that show for me is the monologue. What a gift for a stand-up to be able to do what he does on live television on such a revered platform likeSNLis. It’s always exhilarating. It’s a little terrifying, but just a little. You never do as good as you think you’re going to do, but it’s never that bad. The hardest one was maybe the one when Biden got elected, because we didn’t know he was going to be president until Saturday morning. So I had a set for if Trump won, and I had a set for if Biden won.”\nChappelle often hostsSNLwith major political events as a backdrop. His first time hosting was Nov. 12, 2016, in the aftermath of Donald Trump winning the 2016 election over Hillary Clinton. Chappelle hosted Nov. 7, 2020–just after Joe Biden won that year’s presidential election. His hosting stint on Nov. 12, 2022 was right after midterm elections; and his fourth time hostingSNLwas Jan. 20, 2025–two days after Donald Trump was sworn into his 2nd term. In their sitdown, Amer asks Chappelle about his especially-controversial 2016 monologue, delivered just after Donald Trump won his first term. Chappelle urged the audience to “give him a chance,” but he says it’s just a snapshot of that particular time.\n“I look at it like a photograph,” shares Chappelle. “That’s what it felt like in that moment. Now, if it ages well or not, I don’t get mad if I look at a picture because it’s not today. That’s what it was at that time. You might look at an old set and cringe, but you could just cringe because of how you were at that time.”\nYou can watch the interview video below.\n\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com",

And despite the gloomy weather, neo soul superstar Maxwell (a last minute replacement for D’Angelo) handled things on Saturday night. Musiq Soulchild and Miguel also came with it on Day One. It was Lenny Kravitz’s world on Sunday; as the legendary rocker and Philly’s own Meek Mill closed things out. Kravitz tore through his hits; meanwhile Meek’s set gave the hometown fans plenty to cheer with “Dreams and Nightmares,” and a run of favorites.\nActs like Total and Jagged Edge represented for ’90s R&B groups; andhouse divas CeCe Penistonand Crystal Waters brought dancefloor classics to the crowd. Tems showed everybody that she’s an absolute star; and Latto continued the girl power energy with her set. King Push was joined onstage by surprise guest No Malice, priming the audience for the new Clipse album coming next month. And 2 Chainz seemed to have one of the more well-received performances of the festival, burning through his 2012 hit “I’m Different.”\nAnd of course, there were The Roots. Black Thought, Questlove, and the whole crew were joined onstage by Rahzel the Godfather of Noise and Philly spoken-word poet Ursula Rucker to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their second album, the belovedDo You Want More?!!!??!\nSee on Instagram\nWith diverse acts encompassing the soulful to the effortlessly cool, this year’s Roots picnic showed that–even in the rain–it’s possible to get your shine on.",

        "description": "Tyler, The Creatoris getting real about being a successful creative. The Grammy winner participated in a“Tyler Talk” panelfor Converse in London, where he spoke about the importance of being “delusional” about creating. He also talked about artists needing a team.\n“To make stuff, you gotta be delusional,” he said. “And when you’re delusional, you need people around you that trust you. Because what the f–k they gon’ trust? You say some normal stuff like, ‘The sky is blue.’ Yeah, you don’t need people to trust you to say that. I’m delusional, but I knew what I wanted to do since I was five years old.”\nTyler shared that when he was asked what he would do if he didn’t succeed as an artist.\n“My imagination doesn’t even go that far because this is the only thing I was supposed to do,” he explained. “Like, I was legit the 12-year-old delusional kid like, ‘So I’mma get a Grammy.’ and n—-s was like, ‘Shut up, Charizard just beat Pikachu.’ So, just be delusional.”\nEarlier this year, fellow West Coast mainstay Ice Cube praised Tyler for his artistry and likened him to another legendary hip-hop act out of California.In an interview withHipHopDX, Cube sent some well-deserved praise Tyler’s way.\n“That’s L.A. That’s the L.A. people don’t know about — ultra-creative individuals who won’t conform to the culture of gangbanging. They’re going to be themselves,” he said.\n“He reminds me of, like,The Pharcyde… You’re going to always have those groups who are going to stay down with their own style and their own flavor, and going to win with it,” he added. “Because they’re not conforming, they’re not being what you want them to be; they’re being who they are. And you gotta salute that.”\nTyler, The Creator is currently on the road with his 2025Chromakopia: The World Tour.According to Converse, he’s also preparing tolaunch the 1908 Program with their brand. Tylerupdated designsfor the Naut-1 and the Coach Jogger silhouettes. The Tyler, The Creator x Converse Naut-1 and Coach Jogger will be available in a limited global release on June 20.\nYou can watch Converse’s “Tyler Talk” London interview below.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com",

        "title": "Sacha Jenkins Elevated Hip-Hop Culture Because He Lived It",
        "description": "“I’m sorry. It’s not a white person’s place to have that conversation. It’s a Black person’s place to have that conversation…”\nThat wasSacha Jenkinswhile being interviewed about his Louis Armstrong documentaryBlack & Bluesin 2022. Specifically, Jenkins was addressing Gary Gidden’s 1989 Armstrong documentarySatchmoand whether a white lens is ever qualified to examine the nuances of Black experience. As a Black man and as a communicator with generational storytelling gifts, Jenkins definitely was. On May 23, he died of what his wife, Raquel Cepeda, said were complications frommultiple system atrophy, leaving a legacy that speaks to the power of the Black canonization of Black culture. An embodiment of “for us, by us,” Jenkins was more than just a commentator; he was an active, engaged participant in the culture he chronicled. He was one of hip-hop’s greatest journalistic voices because he didn’t just write about the art: helivedit.\nHe was born in Philadelphia, but young Sacha was mostly raised in Astoria, Queens and he grew up immersed in the creative explosion of NYC as hip-hop and punk were informing the city’s youth culture. Raised by a father who was a filmmaker (director Horace B. Jenkins, II) and a painter mother (artist Monart Renaud); Jenkins’ love of art was evident in his approach to the scene he was now immersed in. He recognized that he himself was part of hip-hop culture, and wanted his work to reflect that. Jenkins never presented himself as simply an observer, he was knee-deep in what was happening and he utilized his perspective to usher in a new brand of Black media.When Jenkins and Haji Akhigbade started theirBeat-Downnewspaperin 1992, hip-hop journalism was just beginning to wield the full power of its voice. With mainstayThe Sourcegoing national, Jenkins andBeat-Downwere able to cultivate an audience that was a little more left-of-center and that sensibility carried over toEgo Trip. Teaming up with Elliott Wilson andJeff “Chairman” Maofor the magazine, Jenkins blended humor with insightful commentary for journalism that was as insightful as it was irreverent. Over the course of a limited run,Ego Triphelped set a new standard for periodicals aimed at “urban” audiences; namely, it refuted the stereotypical boxes Black youth were being expected to squeeze into. And that outside-the-box mentality would inform the whole of Sacha Jenkins' work over the next 30 years.His voice and perspective would find their way into virtually every major platform documenting the culture. Jenkins wrote forSPINandRolling Stone,he was writer-at-large and music editor ofVIBEfrom 1997 to 2000 and was co-author ofEminem’s autobiography,The Way I Am.He produced work for VH1 and the Showtime networks. The sense of humor and sensibility that were catalysts for his first zine were still evident decades later in television projects from Jenkins — likeEgo Trip’s The (White) Rapper ShowandMiss Rap Supreme. He directed some of the most engaging documentaries about Black genius, from Rick James (2021’s stellarBitchin’: The Sound and Fury of Rick James) to Wu-Tang Clan (the 2019 docuseriesWu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men).Jenkins understood the power in the hip-hop generation’s capacity to control its own narrative. To put an even finer point on it: the significance of Black and brown curators to document their culture in their own voice. Heonce explained toOkayplayerthat the lineage of Black music highlights how it’s all born of the same unique experience — and it permeates every generation.“I preach this all the time but whether it's jazz, hip-hop, blues, rock and roll, it's the same story every time,” he told Rashad D. Grove in 2022. “It's the same people, just different generations and different modes of expression, but it's still coming from the same place. It's coming from oppression, it's coming from pain, and it's coming from the pursuit of joy and hip-hop is all of that and it's the most relatable form culturally right now. So it’s a great time for me, you know, as a journalist or one-time journalist or sometimes-journalist. To me, I’m doing journalism with cameras and little art sprinkled in. So when people ask me how did you transition into filmmaking, I always say that I feel like I'm doing what I was doing when I was writing forVIBEorEgo Trip.It's the same idea, just with more people that help execute what you want to do.”That ethos — that mission — helped Jenkins take hip-hop journalism from the underground to the mainstream. But he never lost his skater punk b-boy essence. Sacha Jenkins planted a flag that waves gracefully to this day; you can see his influence in everything from rap podcasts toblerd culture all over the internet. Using a spirit of defiance, snarky wit and an uncompromising love of Blackness, he elevated hip-hop journalism to its peak. He did that. And when it comes to telling Black stories, he did just about everything else, too.\nHe was born in Philadelphia, but young Sacha was mostly raised in Astoria, Queens and he grew up immersed in the creative explosion of NYC as hip-hop and punk were informing the city’s youth culture.

Stacking a slickPowerreference atop a candle metaphor, Lux brings all his battle rap charisma into the type of surgical DAYLYT put-down he hasn’t yet gotten to spit in person: “When niggas who say they want power, ghost the script/Post the the battle, you don't commit/But what I can do is put it on wax, you know it's lit.” It’s a fiery line amid the most random battle royale I’ve ever seen. It’s a dope moment. But Lux still prefers the live-action shouts and impenetrable mean mugs of the URL and the like.\n“I'm from the arena,” he tells Okayplayer. “When you talking about really getting busy, I feel like that's top shelf when you talking about high level competition in rap. We battle. When you space and that energy and then you at it with somebody, ain’t no higher level,” he adds. “And I’ve been in all the spaces.”\nHis latest trip to the on-wax vacuum began with a series of conversations with Joey, who’s currently in the midst of a chaotic, bi-coastal battle royale. “Me and Joey [already] had a relationship,” Lux shares. “He hit me and when he hit me we was just really at first just going back and forth about how it could go, what it is and everything that was going on and talking about how the situation even arose.”\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nSome time after Lux told Joey about his own potentially impending battle with DAYLYT, DAYLYT dropped his Joey diss, “WRD2MIMVA” last Monday. From there, Joey reconnected with Lux for some war room strategy. “[Joey] told me about it after he know what direction he was trying to go, he had a few ideas,\" Lux says. \"Once he let me know what direction he was trying to go in, I think I did my verse the next day.”\nThe result was perhaps the best diss track of this increasingly complicated cross-coast rap battle between Joey, Ray Vaughn, DAYLYT, Az Chike and seemingly 100 others. While there are other strong entries, Joey and Lux flaunt a special N-Y chemistry, with Lux bringing literal decades of live battle experiences to the mix. His years in and outside the booth allow him to effectively translate the visceral energy of live death matches to the confines of an instrumental.\n“I had the luxury of getting my tutelage in the studio close to around the same time that I started really jumping in the arena,” Lux says. “So I had the best of both worlds. I understand how you have to translate from what you do in raw form. It’s allowing the music to hold its space and then you still being able to do what you do. There's a synchronicity that starts to form with that,” he adds. “Once you are aware of it, you coloring in the lines.”\nLux clearly enjoyed the moment, and Joey — and probably everyone else involved — appears to be, too. But DAYLYT is withdrawing from the Bada$ side of things. At the end of his latest diss track, “End Credits,” he gave Joey props for his one-man crusade.\n\"The Ruler's back, oh, you the man, Joey / Today I crown you the King of New York for taking that stand, Joey / You really took the fade with all of us, a brave man / NY-made man, it should say 'Immortal' when your grave land…”\nWhile it’s fun to get jokes off, not every battle has to end the way Kendrick Lamar and Drake’s unfolded. For a true to life battler, DAYLYT’S shoutout is the best case scenario. Evidence that you can live by the pen without having to die by it.\n“Life is a fight,” Lux says, adding a philosophical dimension to the conversation. “[The battles] are friendly fire and it's okay. As long as the competition don't end in casualties, it's a beautiful thing.”",

        "description": "Lizzois opening up about her emotional health. The superstar has enjoyed tremendous success as a musician and actress, but in the latest episode ofTherapuss, she talks about how fame has come with a toll on her psyche.\nIn the episode, Lizzo opened up about pain informing her music.\n“There’s not one album that wasn’t directly impacting my personal life,” she explained. “This time I wrote a song that doesn’t have a happy ending.”Lizzo became one of the most social media-friendly celebs, but she explains that it took a toll on her mentally.“All viral ain't good viral. The internet don’t know that they think all viral is good viral. It’s not.”“Sometimes when my videos going viral, I have an anxiety attack,” she said. “And I’ll be like ‘oh f—, what did I do wrong? I did something wrong? Because I don’t read comments anymore.” She elaborated, saying that she’s had to stop looking at commentary on her posts. “I never scrolled through my comments because that’s hell, but I saw TikTok comments got so mean. You know when I really stopped, after the very backhanded compliments trend.”She also explained that fan expectations could put her in a shame spiral and then she would have to endure online criticism.“That was my first time realizing: Oh wow, there can be misconceptions and you’re not in control of it.”Last month, Lizzo made headlines when she spoke out against the current political climate and presidential administration. The Grammy winner shared her thoughts onBlueSky, referencing white supremacy and social unrest.“I want real change, and I know what it takes to see real change on a systemic level,” she posted. “Protests bring attention to demands. Marches without demands bear no fruit. Demands without a plan or an ultimatum aren’t threatening to any regime.”\n“There’s not one album that wasn’t directly impacting my personal life,” she explained. “This time I wrote a song that doesn’t have a happy ending.”\nLizzo became one of the most social media-friendly celebs, but she explains that it took a toll on her mentally.\n“All viral ain't good viral.

        "description": "Tory Lanez’slegal team is calling for the rapper to be pardoned while claiming to have new evidence in Lanez’s case involving the 2020 shooting ofMegan Thee Stallion. Days after Lanez was stabbed in prison, his representatives held a press conference where they maintained that Megan’s former friendKelsey Harrisactually shot Megan, not Lanez.\nAccording toTMZ, several constituents for the non-profit Unite The People addressed the media on Wednesday, May 14 on Lanez’s behalf. Speaking in downtown Los Angeles, Walter Roberts, the organization's lead legal consultant, said a bodyguard named Bradley James overheard Harris admitting to firing the gun that shot Megan.\nAllegedly, James heard Kelsey say she fired the gun three times, before Tory grabbed her arm and knocked the weapon down, which caused it to fire twice more.\"Mr. Peterson was never given a fair trial, free from bias, political interference and media-driven pressure,\" said Gianno Caldwell, FOX News analyst andNY Postcontributor,according to FOX 11 Los Angeles. Unite The People is calling for Lanezto be pardoned; and Lanez’s fatherhas also urged Governor Gavin Newsomto pardon Lanez.Back during Lanez’s trial in 2022, a witness named Sean Kelly testified that he saw \"two women fighting” before they were broken up. Lanez, born Daystar Peterson, was found guilty of assault with a firearm, illegal possession of a firearm and negligent discharge of a gun. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of assault with a semi-automatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle, and discharging a firearm with gross negligence. Tory is alleged to have shot Megan in the foot in July 2020 as they left a party at the home of Kylie Jenner.Megan’s attorney Alex Spiro refuted Peterson’s team’s claimsin a statement toThe Hollywood Reporter.“Tory Lanez was tried and convicted by a jury of his peers and his case was properly adjudicated through the court system,” Spiro said. “This is not a political matter — this is a case of a violent assault that was resolved in the court of law.”\nAllegedly, James heard Kelsey say she fired the gun three times, before Tory grabbed her arm and knocked the weapon down, which caused it to fire twice more.\n\"Mr. Peterson was never given a fair trial, free from bias, political interference and media-driven pressure,\" said Gianno Caldwell, FOX News analyst andNY Postcontributor,according to FOX 11 Los Angeles.

This is what I do — this is the same approach you would take to making an album or to directing or designing anything: You’ve got to give it your all. People judge you by integrity; that’s how you can measure someone’s principles and morals. If somebody don’t got integrity, and they’re just doing it for the check or the look or the next opportunity, it never works out for them. I promise you. That’s where the phrase ‘Cheaters never win’ comes from. When you cheat yourself in life, you never win in the end.”\nRocky opened up about the experience of sharing scenes with a man he’d grown up idolizing as an actor.“It was like a f**king dream come true. But trust me, it was difficult to not fan the fuck out every millisecond of the f**king duration. It was crazy — it’s fucking Denzel, man. I don’t give a f**k how successful [I am]: I’m always gonna be a student and a fan of certain people, and I’m always going to give them their flowers. I’m never going to be too big to be able to say that I had to hold my composure from not fanning out.“The first movies I really loved wereJuice,Malcolm XandMichael Jackson: Moonwalker.The first time I saw him, I was watchingMalcolm X.”The big movie role comes just months after Rocky’sacquittal on gun assault charges. The Harlem native was facing two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm after he was accused of shooting at a former associate following an argument in 2021.

According to Berklee’s website, honorary doctorate recipients are celebrated and recognized for their invaluable contributions to the worlds of music and philanthropy. 3000 spoke at the 2025 commencement on May 10, offering his words to graduates and sharing how much music has shaped his life.\nHe acknowledged that his musical limitations have never hindered his creativity. \"If someone were to walk up to me right now, and say 'André, I'll give you two billion dollars if you can look at this keyboard and with only two seconds on the clock point to a key that would play the E-note,' I would not be able to,” he admitted.\nAndré joins an esteemed list of past recipients, which includesMissy Elliott, Ringo Starr, Tito Puente,Usher,Q-Tip, Willie Nelson, Gloria Estefan and the inaugural honoree, Duke Ellington.

        "description": "The D.O.C.is a hip-hop legend and one of the game’s most tragic “What ifs?” His legendary debut album, devastating car accident and subsequent vocal damage have become indelible parts of rap history. His skills as a ghostwriter help to fuel the careers of artists likeSnoop Doggand Dr. Dre. Now, he is launching his new nonprofit education initiative,Dreams Experience Academy(DEA) to be a catalyst for change to his native Southern Dallas.\nYou can check out The D.O.C.’s statement on the launch below:The D.O.C.:I come from Southern Dallas. Where the music’s loud, the struggles echo and the voices often go unheard.When I was just a kid, I wasn’t sure what I’d be, but I knew I had something to say. I found my way to the mic, and once I got there, I made sure no one could ignore me.Hip-hop gave me that, the power to speak.I found my rhythm in Dallas, then took my dreams to the West Coast. Linked up with Dre, Cube, Eazy [-E] and the rest. We formed something that would reshape music, take over radio waves and smash through barriers. N.W.A was more than music — it was the truth. And I was a part of that, not just on the mic, but behind it, writing rhymes that gave others their voice. I repped Dallas and helped elevate the West Coast, reaching the top of the mountain. But it wasn’t long before fate snatched me from off that peak and almost took my voice forever.That night in 1989, I was flying through the streets of L.A., like I had been flying through life — fast, no brakes. The car crash? It changed everything. One minute, I was invincible; the next, I couldn’t speak. My vocal chords torn. Silenced. Imagine — an MC on the rise, his whole career and all his dreams right in front of him — almost gone in an instant.For a while, I held onto anger. I was bitter about what I lost. But eventually, I had to realize — my story wasn’t over. I couldn’t rap anymore, but I could still write, still create, still be a force in this game. I got behind the scenes, ghostwriting for [Dr.] Dre, Snoop [Dogg] and others. I taught Snoop how to turn his freestyles into hits, how to capture that magic and turn it into gold. I was the silent voice behind some of the biggest records you’ve ever heard.Most people know me for No One Can Do It Better. But real ones know I’m the one who helped make The Chronic what it was, the one who pushed Dre to go solo. When Snoop dropped \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang,\" that was our work. And while they were out there shining, I had to make peace with being in the shadows.But here’s the thing: losing my voice? It didn’t kill my spirit. Maybe I didn’t need to be the loudest voice in the room anymore. Maybe my purpose was to help others find their voice.That’s part of the reason I came back home to Dallas. Came home. Full circle. It was time to give back to the place that gave me my start. The city raised me, but I knew it was raising a whole generation of kids who might not catch the same breaks I did. I couldn’t sit back and watch these talented young people get swallowed by a system that might not see them, might not hear them.So I started The Dreams Experience Academy. This isn’t just another nonprofit; it’s my way of giving kids the mic, letting them tell their stories. In the streets where I grew up, in Southern Dallas, there are voices that deserve to be heard — voices that could change everything.These kids? They’ve got cultural capital. They know what’s hot, what’s next, what will move the needle. But they need help turning that into something more.I partnered with Chris Gannett, another Dallas native, who followed his dreams. Who used to be the CMO of American Idol. Who ran $100 million banking divisions. You wouldn’t expect us to team up — on the surface, we look like hip-hop and corporate America — but that’s the beauty of it. We’re a little bit of an odd couple, but we’re here to show that when you mix different perspectives, you can create something powerful.At The Dreams Experience Academy, we’re helping these young people build real skills — not just for entertainment, but for media, tech, gaming, storytelling, entrepreneurship. The stuff that drives culture and moves markets. These are industries where careers are made and power is shaped — but where too often, people who look like us don’t get a seat at the table. We’re out to change that. And it’s not just about dreams — it’s about equity, access and showing the world what Southern Dallas talent can really do.We’re definitely not doing it alone. A special thank you to our partners who are helping us lay the foundation — from the Dallas Regional Chamber and The Dallas Foundation, to longtime educators like Big Thought and community leaders like T.D. Jakes Foundation. And shoutout to For Oak Cliff, which has been on the front lines of tackling chronic absenteeism, and are helping Southern Dallas keep kids in school and on track.Dreams Experience Academy isn’t just about teaching; it’s about transformation. And this isn’t just for Dallas — our vision is national in scope. First stop, our hometown. But we’ve got plans for more sites across the country. In a way, this is me giving back the voice I lost all those years ago. Only now, I’m giving it to these kids, so they can shout louder than I ever could.I’m thankful for my people — my family, my friends, everyone who’s stood with me. We’re just getting started, but I can feel it: this time, it’s bigger than me. To my city, to the streets that helped make me — this one’s for you. Dallas raised me, and now it’s time for me to raise up the next generation. These kids? They’ll be the ones to carry the torch, to write the next chapter in our story.So listen closely. The mic’s theirs now.\nYou can check out The D.O.C.’s statement on the launch below:\nThe D.O.C.:I come from Southern Dallas.

And while they were out there shining, I had to make peace with being in the shadows.\nBut here’s the thing: losing my voice? It didn’t kill my spirit. Maybe I didn’t need to be the loudest voice in the room anymore. Maybe my purpose was to help others find their voice.\nThat’s part of the reason I came back home to Dallas. Came home. Full circle. It was time to give back to the place that gave me my start. The city raised me, but I knew it was raising a whole generation of kids who might not catch the same breaks I did. I couldn’t sit back and watch these talented young people get swallowed by a system that might not see them, might not hear them.\nSo I started The Dreams Experience Academy. This isn’t just another nonprofit; it’s my way of giving kids the mic, letting them tell their stories. In the streets where I grew up, in Southern Dallas, there are voices that deserve to be heard — voices that could change everything.\nThese kids? They’ve got cultural capital. They know what’s hot, what’s next, what will move the needle. But they need help turning that into something more.\nI partnered with Chris Gannett, another Dallas native, who followed his dreams. Who used to be the CMO of American Idol. Who ran $100 million banking divisions. You wouldn’t expect us to team up — on the surface, we look like hip-hop and corporate America — but that’s the beauty of it. We’re a little bit of an odd couple, but we’re here to show that when you mix different perspectives, you can create something powerful.\nAt The Dreams Experience Academy, we’re helping these young people build real skills — not just for entertainment, but for media, tech, gaming, storytelling, entrepreneurship. The stuff that drives culture and moves markets. These are industries where careers are made and power is shaped — but where too often, people who look like us don’t get a seat at the table. We’re out to change that. And it’s not just about dreams — it’s about equity, access and showing the world what Southern Dallas talent can really do.\nWe’re definitely not doing it alone. A special thank you to our partners who are helping us lay the foundation — from the Dallas Regional Chamber and The Dallas Foundation, to longtime educators like Big Thought and community leaders like T.D. Jakes Foundation. And shoutout to For Oak Cliff, which has been on the front lines of tackling chronic absenteeism, and are helping Southern Dallas keep kids in school and on track.\nDreams Experience Academy isn’t just about teaching; it’s about transformation. And this isn’t just for Dallas — our vision is national in scope. First stop, our hometown. But we’ve got plans for more sites across the country. In a way, this is me giving back the voice I lost all those years ago. Only now, I’m giving it to these kids, so they can shout louder than I ever could.\nI’m thankful for my people — my family, my friends, everyone who’s stood with me. We’re just getting started, but I can feel it: this time, it’s bigger than me. To my city, to the streets that helped make me — this one’s for you. Dallas raised me, and now it’s time for me to raise up the next generation. These kids? They’ll be the ones to carry the torch, to write the next chapter in our story.\nSo listen closely. The mic’s theirs now.",

        "description": "Seven months afterSean “Diddy” Combswas arrested on federal charges, his trial has officially begun. While jury selection took place last week, the opening statements were just delivered this morning.\nWhat is Diddy being charged with?While Diddy has been hit with a multitude of allegations from various parties over the last year, this trial revolves around charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. He was arrested for the charges on Sept. 16, 2024.According to the indictment, Diddy used his wealth and influence to facilitate a sex trafficking ring while using violence and coercion to protect his reputation while maintaining his operations. Prosecutors allege that Diddy led a “criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\"More specifically speaking, he is accused of hosting “freak-offs,” sex parties in which Diddy arranged for the transportation and attendance of commercial sex workers. Prosecutors allege that Diddy used drugs, \"force, threats of force, and coercion\" to make alleged victims engage in sex acts with said male commercial sex workers.Diddy is also accused of committing acts of violence and coercion against several women. According to the federal indictment, freak-offs were recorded and allegedly used as collateral to influence victims.What is Diddy’s defense?According toCNN, one of Diddy’s defense attorneys,Teny Geragos, used her opening statement to claim that, “This case is about voluntary adult choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships.”How much time is Diddy facing?If Diddy is convicted on the racketeering charge, he could face life in prison. He also faces minimums of 10 years and 15 years in prison for the transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking charges.Who is on the Jury?According toThe New York Post’s Ben Kochman, the jury consists of eight men and four women. Of the jury members, four are white, while the rest are people of color.Who are the witnesses?Diddy’s former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, better known as singerCassie, is expected to testifythat Diddy subjected her to years of physical and emotional abuse. She was signed to Diddy’s Bad Boy Records. Cassie filed a civil suit against Diddy for said abuse in November 2023, and it was settled out of court one day later. Cassie is the witness we know about so far.Who are the lawyers?Prosecutors:The prosecution team is made up of Emily A. Johnson, Mitzi Steiner, Madison Reddick Smyser, Christy Slavik and Maurene Comey. Comey famously led the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years for helping operate Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operations.Diddy’s Lawyers:Predictably, Diddy’s defense team is a formidable one that includes Brian Steel (Young Thug’s defense team, YSL Trial), Nicole Westmoreland (YSL case), Marc Agnifilo (Luigi Mangione’s defense team, United Healthcare CEO shooting) and Teny Geragos (Agnifilo’s Agnifilo Intrater law firm). Steel was recently immortalized when Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR named a song after him. He helped facilitate a plea deal for his most famous client, Young Thug, to avoid a lengthy prison sentence for the YSL RICO case in Atlanta.Who is the Judge?U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian is presiding over this case.How long will the trial last?While there isn’t an exact time set,Reutersreports that the trial is expected to last eight to 10 weeks.\nWhile Diddy has been hit with a multitude of allegations from various parties over the last year, this trial revolves around charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.

The latest trailer was released on Monday, May 6, andThe Pointer Sistersare front-and-center with their 1986 hit “Hot Together” playing throughout the clip.\nThe main duo of Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos are the focus of the trailer, with the legendary sisters soundtracking the couple’s Bonnie & Clyde-esque misadventures after Lucia gets out of prison.\nThe Pointer Sisters enjoyed success in a variety of genres over the course of their decades-long career. Initially a quartet consisting of sisters Bonnie, Anita, June and Ruth Pointer, with hits like “Yes We Can-Can,” and How Long (Betcha Got a Chick On the Side),” the group saw its greatest success in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a trio (after the departure of sister Bonnie) with smashes like “Jump (To My Love),” “So Excited” and “Automatic.”\nAccording toBillboard, the group won three Grammy Awards and has sevenBillboardHot 100hits. The Pointer Sisters not only had hits in R&B, but also pop, rock andcountry. After forming in Oakland in the late 1960s, they released 15 studio albums from the 1970s through the 1990s, and have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nYoungest sister June died in 2006, and Bonnie Pointer died in 2020. Anita died in 2022. Ruth still performs with her daughter, Issa, and granddaughter, Sadako, as The Pointer Sisters.\n“Me and my sisters, we were women starting off early in our 20s,” Ruthexplained toBillboardlast year. “And of course life brings on changes where you marry and have children and it changes your priorities. And life goes on and you lose people, which is what happened to us. It’s definitely a challenge a lot of times, but that’s just the way life is. You just roll along.\nGTA VIhas been long delayed but the video game is finally set to drop on May 26, 2026. It’s been more than a decade sinceGrand Theft Auto V, which was released back in 2013.",

        "description": "Former hip-hop mogulSuge Knighthas agreed to a $1.5 million settlement to the family ofTerry Carter, the man Knight ran over and killed in 2015.Rolling Stonereportsthat Knight was previously expected to go to retrial –after the last one was declared a mistrial in 2022. At the time, jurors were deadlocked 7-5 in favor of finding Knight liable.\nIn March, Knight moved to have his sentence overturned —and his attempt was denied. The Death Row Records founder’s longtime attorney, David Kenner, moved to withdraw from Knight’s case; with Kenner citing a conflict of interest. However, earlier this week, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Thomas Long said there would be no more delays.\n“There will be no additional continuances. This case is out of time,” Judge Long told Knight.\nIn 2015,Carter was killedafter an altercation between Knight and film advisor Cle “Bone” Sloan at Tam’s Burgers in Compton, CA. In 2018,Knight was sentenced to 28 yearsafter pleading no contest to voluntary manslaughter. He issued a statement toRolling Stone. He explained his justification for settling.“Terry was a friend of mine. It definitely wasn’t done intentionally. It wasn’t done to bring harm to him,” said Knight. “One of the reasons I settled [is] I got respect for Terry, so that means I’ve got respect for his family.”“I didn’t want to put the family through more pain. It’s not that I did anything wrong. I never would have. But I do owe the family an apology because of this thing they had to go through.”Carter’s widow, Lillian Carter, bashed Knight for her family’s ordeal.“It’s hard living without him when I lived all those many years with him. It’s been very, very difficult. I’ve been in pain ever since Jan. 29, 2015, I haven’t had a good day, not one good day,” she said. “I’m not happy with the outcome of it, at all, but I don’t want to give him another opportunity to put on a clown show and act like a b***h. Maybe somebody will shank him in jail.”“I’m relieved it’s finally concluded,” said his daughter Nekaya. “It has been a long and emotional journey. We couldn’t put ourselves through that again. I want to move forward, just like my dad always encouraged us to do.”\n\nIn 2015,Carter was killedafter an altercation between Knight and film advisor Cle “Bone” Sloan at Tam’s Burgers in Compton, CA.

The episode featured the top 14 finalists performing songs from legendary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees.\nEarly ‘60s rock and roller Chubby Checker, British classic rockers Bad Company, ‘80s pop queen Cyndi Lauper, grunge icons Soundgarden, garage rock revivalists the White Stripes and famed blues-rock vocalist Joe Cocker are also nominated in the Performer category. Singer-songwriter Warren Zevon joins Salt-N-Pepa as this year’s Musical Influence Award winners.\n“Each of these inductees created their own sound and attitude that had a profound impact on culture and helped to change the course of rock and roll forever,” said John Sykes, Chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in a statement. “Their music gave a voice to generations and influenced countless artists that followed in their footsteps.”In the ‘80s and ‘90s, Salt-N-Pepa was the first female hip-hop act to achieve gold and platinum commercial success; and in 1995, they were also the first female hip-hop act to win a Grammy for their empowerment anthem “None of Your Business.” OutKast helped solidify the commercial viability of southern rap acts and famously took home the Album Of The Year Grammy in 2004 for their acclaimed double albumSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.The jam band Phish did not make the final cut for induction, despite winning the fan vote.According toVariety, the band scored a first-place finish with 330,000 votes registered by fans. The fan vote is only equal to one ballot, in total — and counts no more or less than the 1,200 votes cast by industry insiders who participate in the election by invitation.Artists are eligible for induction 25 years after their first commercial recordings were released.

With Olivier-Award winner Kwame Kwei-Armah as writer-director,CrazySexyCool – The TLC Musicalwill premiere next year at Arena Stage Theater from June 12, 2026 through Aug. 9.According toTHR, the project is being described as a “semi-biographical” look at the chart-topping '90s trio, which produced hit albums and massive songs such as “No Scrubs,” “What About Your Friends” and “Waterfalls.”\nThe musical is produced by Bill Diggins’ Diggit Theatrical Group.\n“TLC completely changed the game,” Diggins said in a press statement. “Their music gave a voice to women everywhere, empowering them to be confident and unapologetic. But this isn’t just a story about the music; it’s about the sisterhood between these women and what kept them together through both unimaginable challenges and chart-topping success.”\nT-Boz shared the producer’s sentiment.\n“Bringing this story to the stage is a dream come true. We have performed in a lot of different venues all over the world throughout our career, but bringing our story and music to the theater is a totally new and exciting challenge.”\nTLC formed in Atlanta in the early 90s and rose to superstardom. Members T-Boz, Chilli and the late Left Eye became icons of a generation; becoming known for an infectious mix of self-awareness, female empowerment and sex appeal en route to becoming perhaps the biggest girl group of the era. They first revealed plans to take their story to the musical stageback in 2023.\nNow they’ve made that dream a reality.\n“We have some of the best people in the business working on this project,” Chilli said in a statement. “Audiences will get to hear our story – mostly fact with a sprinkle of fiction – told in our own way, and of course it’s set to all your favorite hits!”\nCrazySexyCool– The Musicalwill world premiere at Arena Stage in Washington, DC, in June 2026 for eight weeks as part of Arena Stage’s 75th anniversary season.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com",

Not just of the physical item, but letting go of your connection to what it’s supposed to mean, or the memory. You’re literally letting them go. That was the purpose.

        "description": "Soulja Boyhas been ordered to pay more than $4 million and has been found liable in his civil case for claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress,  sexual battery, assault, sexual harassment and non-payment of wages.According toEntertainment Weekly, the rapper (born DeAndre Way) was found liable by a jury in Santa Monica, Calif., after a three-week trial that saw Way's ex-assistant (the unnamed Jane Doe) accuse him of a wide array of assault and abuse.\n\"We're happy our client was vindicated and the jury believed her claims of physical and sexual assault,\" Ron Zambrano, an attorney for the plaintiff, said in a statement. \"We're looking forward to moving on to the punitive damages phase of the case.\"\nWay’s attorney Rickey Ivie also shared a statement.\n“We maintain that the evidence does not support the verdict,” he said in a statement toVariety. “It is unfortunate that aspersions and misperceptions of a culture were allowed to influence the trial. Mr. Way fully intends to pursue his post-trial remedies and to fight for a just result in this case.”In 2021, Way was accused of raping and kidnapping Jane Doe while she was working as his personal assistant in 2018. She claimed that within the first month of employment, Way sent her photos of his penis and they initiated a romantic relationship that turned violent.“The district attorney never filed charges. I was never charged or convicted of this, criminally,” the “Crank Dat” rapper toldRolling Stone. “So, to be accused of this civilly is beyond me.

For her opening performance, Lizzo performed a medley of “Love in Real Life” and “Still Bad” from her upcoming album, and showed off her guitar skills.

        "title": "Rediscovered: A Tribe Called Quest’s 'People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm'",
        "description": "A Tribe Called Quest’sPeople’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythmbegins with a shimmer — a soft static that sounds like the surf breaking in slow motion. At first it’s low. Then it gets louder and closer. It suggests a cosmic arrival, a visitor who is entering our world from a great distance. A wailing baby connotes we’re traversing a birth canal, but the celestial ambiance tells us if this is a child, it’s out of Stanley Kubrick, one with a pulsating galaxy brain who has been cocooned in the stars for centuries, watching our world from on high, and learning. Then the music starts, and it becomes unclear if what we’ve just heard was an alien coming to us in real time, or out of the distant past. Or back from the future. In actuality, somehow, that galactic paradigm shift has just turned 35.\nOn this day in 1990, Tribe Called Quest touched down fully formed withPeople’s Instinctive Travels, a totemic album that remade a section of hip-hop in the image of proudly intrepid kids from Queens. Amid the rage of so-called gangsta rappers and politically charged explosions, Tribe presented something simultaneously radical and tame. Their sonic and thematic identity is stitched into their very fabric; their moniker sounded more like a short story than the proper name of a rap group. Its afro-futurist album title could’ve been quoting Maya Angelou. Or Gil-Scott Heron. Or Spike Lee. Or Sun Ra. It wasn’t, but that’s the tradition they hailed from. They were old souls — intellectually curious art school kids who didn’t have the resources to go to art school. But as a cosmic gag, the city sent them to Murry Bergtraum Business High School, in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge on the Manhattan side, where they met the Jungle Brothers and began to find their Native Tongues.\nThere had been warning shots with the eventual members of that one of a kind sprawling artist collective. Q-Tip appeared on the Jungle Brothers’ “Doin’ Our Own Dang” onDone by the Forces of Nature\",and “Buddy” on De La Soul’s3 Feet High and Risingin 1989 (Phife joined him on the remix). At the end of that year, the Tribe released the first single from their forthcoming debut, “Description of a Fool”, which was selected over surefire jams like the lovely “Bonita Applebaum” and the goofy, addictive “Left my Wallet In El Segundo”, which would both go on to be bigger hits. It might have felt left-field at the time, but you feel the intentionality of making “Fool” their introduction. Over a vibrant Roy Ayers flip, Q-Tip delivers five minutes of observational comedy as he roasts the eponymous dumbasses in his community. It’s an unofficial mission statement for a Tribe that would soon be known across the universe. Sure, it’s “conscious” rap, but there’s no self-righteous fury. It’s political, but not overtly so. It’s warm. Funny. Lived in. Not the dire biblical moralizing of stone-faced elders like Rakim. It is instead the musings of a city kid who was as wry as he was well read. It was a measured — mostly casual — rebellion amid a storm of alchemized exasperation.\nIn the ’80s there had been an arms race between the U.S. and Russia as both nations were engulfed by the Cold War. At home, acts from Run DMC to N.W.A and Public Enemy basked in a slavish dedication to the drum and increasingly loud, layered, hyper-kinetic walls of sound rioting against President Reagan and his police state.People’s Instinctive Travelswas released on the same day as its sonic inverse,Fear of a Black Planet.Fear of a Black Planetfeatured the Bomb Squad’s angriest, noisiest sound collages up to that point, with songs like the controversial, flame-spewing “Welcome to the Terrordome” emanating an ominous, confrontational wrath. In a contrasting approach, Q-Tip’s production slows rap down. If Public Enemy was being abrasive, Tip and Tribe were immersive. Q-Tip’s lush production defined the effect; these beats are laced with patient multi-bar loops that feel luxurious. They’re given room to breathe and thus had the texture of live instrumentation before Tip ever brought live instrumentation into the process. With beats like “After Hours” there’s a calm confidence, a latent realization — either by a genius or by a pragmatic kid composing with nothing but two cassette decks and a pause button standing in for a crossfader, (or both) — that just because youcansample everything, doesn’t meanyou have to.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nQ-Tip isn’t Erick Sermon or Marley Marl or Pete Rock or Rick Rubin or the Dust Brothers. There is an immediate eclectic, refined aesthetic palate, Tribe knows what they’re into and what they want their music to sound like. It’s less chaos brained than the nutty professor/Prince who made beats for De La on their paradigm-shifting debut a year earlier. Tip is pulling Donald Byrd, Grover Washington Jr., Earth Wind & Fire, Billy Brooks, Cannonball Adderly, The Chambers Brothers, Sly & The Family Stone, and perhaps most famously, Lou Reed on “Can I Kick It?” It’s chill shit, all smooth jazz baselines and warm key progressions, an uncanny instance of a person’s taste in music perfectly matching the specific tone of their incredible voice. And that voice is perfectly matched, better than any voice in rap ever has been, to his childhood friend from St. Albans and mic partner Phife Dawg.\nDoing more supporting work here than the co-lead he’d become, Phife appears on just four songs. They’re all album highlights, because from a sonic standpoint, as two instruments in harmony, he is the yin to Q-Tip’s yang. They flaunt that chemistry on “Ham ‘N’ Eggs,” a nerdy paean to clean eating that is indicative of some of the freer moments on the album that would be ironed out over time. These songs contain a playful, scatting, cafeteria table, “this word rhymes with that word” spontaneity to the super structures of Tip and Phife’s “verses.”\n\nAlternating between bars for “Ham ‘N’ Eggs,” Q-Tip and Phife emanate all the juvenile energy of a school lunchtable cypher: “Ham “Eggs was fryin', ham was smellin'/In ten minutes, she started yellin' (Come and get it!)/And the gettin's were good/I said, ’I shouldn't eat it,’ she said, ’I think you should’/But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians/No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian/Strictly collard greens and the occasional steak.”\nBut within Tribe’s “Youthful Expressions” and diary entries, pinging off ideas like sugar and THC drunk kids scribbling in a marble notebook on the E train or the J train or the Long Island Railroad, there are constant surprises spilling out, observed beauty and beyond their years profundity that expanded conventional ideas of the function of a rap song.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nTheir subsequent two albums have always been understood as their masterpieces, and they’re certainly more defined, complete, mature statements. But there is an unsteady pleasure to their debut that the others don’t have. It’s the group announcing themselves, trying on different looks and feels, and with some of these flourishes they would leave behind, the listener imagines decision trees branching out through a multiverse, the different groups they might have become if they had limitless lives and even more chances to define themselves.\nA firmly held belief of mine is if you live in New York, you must listen to Boot Camp Clik every winter and Tribe every summer. Particularly the initial, perfect triptych ofPeople’s Instinctive Travels,The Low End TheoryandMidnight Maraudersuncannily captures a hot and listless Saturday afternoon in a city under a blue sky, perhaps hopping a turnstile north en route to a matinee to hide in AC, or south to Coney Island to play in the surf with a nutcracker, perhaps setting up for a block party or park cookout or sunset rooftop function once the heat burns off, smoking weed on a stoop in a neighborhood you don’t live in, being in Washington Square Park and taking in the unfathomable, global diversity that has formed below an arch and around a fountain and how this human menagerie informed and will continue to form the minds of the city’s brightest children, as Jairobi White, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg, and Q-Tip once were. This summer, and every summer for the rest of your life, on one of those Saturday afternoons before the heat gets oppressive, throw onPeople’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, and you’ll see. Tap into the shared history and community of New York, and be reminded of your insignificant but existent place in its dense, infinite story.",

        "description": "Kid Capriis addressing what he says is one particularly famous use of his voice. The iconic DJ claimed his voice was used in the popular theme song forthe hit sitcomMartinand that he never got credit for it.In a new interview withBag Fuel, Kid Capri explains where the sample came from and why he hasn’t taken an issue with it until now.\n“They took my voice fromDef Comedy Jam, sampled it, put it on the Martin show,” Capri explained. “Never got no permission from me, never asked for my rights, nothing. This show [has] been on eight different networks for 30 years. Now if it was a money thing for me, I would [have] been like, ‘Yo where’s my bread?’ I ain’t never did that.”\nOriginally airing on the FOX network from 1992 through 1997,Martinhas now aired on multiple networks over the past three decades. Capri initially let the issue slide, but says he felt compelled to say something, after the show’s stars Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell allegedly denied that the voice was his. Capri is now considering legal action.\nSee on Instagram\nCapripreviously talked about the issue last yearduring an appearance on theFun House Podcastwith Kid ‘n Play.\n“[Anyone] that knows me would know it’s me,” Capri said at the time. “And it would be foolish to say it’s anybody else. I think Martin overstepped his boundaries, number one, by taking something that belonged to me without getting my permission.”\n“They went and took my property. You got everybody wandering around the country saying ‘Martinnnnnn,’” Capri added, according to Atlanta Black Star. “But to go and take it and then get on your show later on and have Tisha Campbell say on Fox Soul that that wasn’t Capri, that’s Cole, um, and then you get on your show in your reunion to say it wasn’t me, it’s a blatant slap in the face and a disrespect to me.”\n\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com",

        "description": "A documentary onPrincemade byO.J.: Made in Americacreator Ezra Edelman for Netflix was cancelled in February.\nIn a report fromVariety, the streaming service said in a statement to the outlet that it would no longer be moving forward with Edelman’s project, and would instead be working with Prince’s estate on a film.\n“The Prince Estate and Netflix have come to a mutual agreement that will allow the estate to develop and produce a new documentary featuring exclusive content from Prince’s archive,” Netflix said. “As a result, the Netflix documentary will not be released.”\nLast year,aNew York Timesmagazine articlewas published that included details of the Edelman-led documentary. The story noted that the project included interviews with Prince’s ex-girlfriends, some of whom accused him of physical and emotional abuse. According to theTimes, the documentary also touched on abuse he faced during his childhood.Edelman’s project was a six-part docuseries; he had been given extensive access to Prince’s archives after he was enlisted to take on the documentary after replacing Ava DuVernay, who was the original director,according toVariety.However, in June last year, the outlet, citing news publicationPuck, reported that the docuseries was “dead in the water” after representatives for Prince’s estate deemed a cut of the project featured “dramatic” factual inaccuracies and other issues.Earlier this month, Edelman snapped back about the comment inan interview on thePablo Torre Finds Outpodcast, saying, \"It's a joke... They came back with a 17-page document full of editorial issues, not factual issues. You think I have any interest in putting out a film that's factually inaccurate?\"Varietyalso noted that Edelman’s cut came in at nine hours — three hours over the six-hour deal for the documentary — which violated “the agreement that presumably enabled the estate to withhold music rights,” the outlet reported.“Although Netflix and Edelman maintain final cut of the film, a Prince documentary without his music would face daunting, if not insurmountable, creative and commercial obstacles,”Varietyadded.In theTimes’2024 report, Netflix had said of the project at the time, “This documentary project has proved every bit as complex as Prince himself. We have meticulously archived Prince’s life and worked hard to support Ezra’s series.

While he’s no stranger to hip-hop, he’s obviously been gone a very long time, and it wouldn’t have been surprising to see that he got some pointers when approaching his latest musical effort. And it turns out he did just that.\nIn an interview with Sway’s Universe, Smith shared that he consulted with two of the greatest emcees in hip-hop before he dove into making the project:Jay-ZandKendrick Lamar.\n“Before I started, I made two phone calls. I talked to Jay and I talked to Kendrick. I was like, ‘Hey, I want to get back in music,” Smith said. “What’s the advice?’ Jay said, ‘Don’t fake your story.’ He was like, ‘You gotta say what’s true for you.”\nHe shared that it was Jay’s words that inspired the album’s title.\n“He’s like, ‘You’ll be looking at the younger rappers and you want that to be true for you, but you don’t live like that. He was like, ‘Be true to your story. Tell your story.’ That’s where I got theBased On a True Storyfrom; Jay.”\nAs for Lamar, what Smith got from his younger counterpart was more rigorous.According toBillboard, K. Dot pushed the former Fresh Prince to face his fear as an artist.\n“Basically the same thing, be honest. It was scary,” Smith explained. “Make the record you want to make. Don’t try to make the record that you think people will like you for. Make the one that’s authentic.”\nWill Smith will hit the road this summer for a European tour in support ofBased On A True Story.\nhttps://youtu.be/ED2GQpwwYnQ?si=aQEBfk5wYhb030S0",

That same year, at age 45, he reclaimed the heavyweight title by defeating Michael Moorer — becoming the oldest boxer ever to win the heavyweight championship.His passing was met with an outpouring of grief and tributes.\nSee on Instagram\n\"Our hearts are broken.

Overall, I knew I wanted to write, and read, something meaty that addressed the history and nuance of rap beef in a fresh way.”\nWhile there’s a tendency to analyze beef and rap battles in a vacuum, Grier hopes to examine those moments through a sociological lens. “I hope to start a conversation,” she explains. “The ways we talk about women, beef and battling are due for reframing. It's more than songs and social media posts. There are personalities, social conditions, and a living, breathing culture to consider.”\nPre-order for the book will be available soon.",

The podcast is one of the shows inABC News’audio division’s new programming slate. The Bad Boy Records founderfaces federal chargesincluding assault, sex trafficking and racketeering.\nAccording to ABC News, the podcast “will trace how whispers of abuse came to light and led to the stunning federal charges and civil lawsuits that Diddy now faces.”\nCalledBad Rap: The Case Against Diddy, the six-part weekly narrative series launches March 25. The series will initially focus on the background of the allegations against Combs; and it will then include twice-weekly episodes once Combs’ trial begins — with “real-time updates,” according toABC News.\n“True crime resonates, and the audience just seems to have an appetite that knows no ends,” Liz Alesse, VP of audio forABC News,toldThe Hollywood Reporter.Bad Rap: The Case Against Diddyis expected to be an anchor show on ABC Audio’s new podcast slate in collaboration with “20/20,” which it says will provide “always-on true crime content.” The platforms’ new podcasts will join ABC News’ daily news podcast “Start Here” and the “20/20” podcast.“We see two opportunities here as a news organization,” Alesse says. “Our narrative approach is going to be a marriage of zeitgeist, real-time true crime like Diddy, but also exploring stories that have already sort of come to a natural conclusion that exists within our archive. So as a news organization, we have the opportunity to stay on the news, to be timely, relevant, resonate and be one step ahead on the stories that people are currently talking about, but we also have this rich archive where we can introduce audiences to stories that might not be as front and center to them.”Opening statements for Sean Combs’ trial will begin May 12.\n“True crime resonates, and the audience just seems to have an appetite that knows no ends,” Liz Alesse, VP of audio forABC News,toldThe Hollywood Reporter.\nBad Rap: The Case Against Diddyis expected to be an anchor show on ABC Audio’s new podcast slate in collaboration with “20/20,” which it says will provide “always-on true crime content.” The platforms’ new podcasts will join ABC News’ daily news podcast “Start Here” and the “20/20” podcast.\n“We see two opportunities here as a news organization,” Alesse says. “Our narrative approach is going to be a marriage of zeitgeist, real-time true crime like Diddy, but also exploring stories that have already sort of come to a natural conclusion that exists within our archive.

        "description": "In a newly unveiled recording,Jay-Z’s rape accuser can be heard saying the rapper never sexually assaulted her.\nAn excerpt of the recording,obtained and first reported on by ABC News, is a conversation between the woman, identified as Jane Doe, and two private investigators of Jay’s, whose real name is Shawn Carter. In the recording, one of the investigators can be heard asking Doe, “He was just there, but he didn't have anything to do with any sexual acts towards you?”\n“Yeah,” she responded.\nShe also said that her lawyer, Tony Buzbee, encouraged her to sue Carter, according to ABC News.\n“He was the one that kind of pushed me towards going forward with him, with Jay-Z,” Doe reportedly said in the recording.\n“Buzbee did?” the investigators asked, with the woman replying, “Yeah.”\nIn a now-dismissed lawsuit, Doe said that Jay and Diddy raped her when she was 13 years old after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. This recording obviously contradicts that. But it’s not the end of this story.\nIn a separate report fromRolling Stone, which independently obtained the recording, the outlet said that Buzbee sent his own recording of a conversation between himself and Doe. In it, she denied that she told the private investigators that Carter did not assault her, as well as denied telling them that Buzbee pushed her to sue.\nBuzbee also sent a statement toRolling Stoneabout the recording between the investigators and Doe, saying, “Her position is very clear and has never changed. The tape is a pieced-together fabrication. The investigators tormented and harassed and tricked that poor woman and took what she said out of context and secretly recorded her. She stands by her claim that Jay-Z was there at the party and that [he] assaulted her. She has never wavered on that point, not once.”\nThe outlet also reported that a separate investigator associated with Carter said in court filings that Doe has “a legally-documented history of mental health issues.”\nAdditionally, the outlet noted both a family court case where a doctor testified in a 2015 deposition about Doe sharing that she had a history of auditory hallucinations, as well as a separate motion filed by the woman in February last year, where she and a different lawyer from Buzbee asked a judge to transfer her to mental health court for a pending matter.\nRolling Stoneasked Buzbee about Doe’s mental health status, to which he told the outlet in an email, “I’m not her psychologist. I think it’s inappropriate to attack her on alleged past mental health issues in light of her assertions. That’s the ultimate in low.”\nThe lawsuit against Carter and Diddy, real name Sean Combs, was voluntarily dismissed last month. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that it’s dismissed permanently.\nThe lawsuit was first filed in October last year; Carter’s name was added to it in December. Doe claimed that Carter and Combs had raped her at an MTV Video Music Awards party in September of 2000 when she was a teenager.\nEarlier this month, Carterfiled a defamation lawsuitagainst Doe and Buzbee related to the dismissed suit.",

        "description": "Dawn Robinsonhas shared that she’s been living in her car for the past 3 years.\n“You guys, for the past almost 3 years, I have been living in my car. I said it! Oh my God, it’s out,” she began before sharing how this all began in 2020, when she was living with her parents in Las Vegas.Robinson claimed that her mother “became very angry” and “a lot of her anger she was taking out on me and I was her target all the time.”“I didn’t understand it, I still don’t,” she said. “I was just trying to figure it out but I couldn’t — you can’t read someone else’s mind, you can’t figure them out. They have to figure themselves out.”From there, Robinson said that she was “sleeping in my car for maybe about a month in Vegas,” when a former co-manager said that she could come live with him in Los Angeles.She claimed that the co-manager assured her that he had enough room for her, but upon getting there she said that wasn’t the case. So instead, the co-manager put her in a hotel for “one night that turned into eight months.”Hoping to instead get an apartment, Robinson said that she suggested multiple ones to the co-manager but he didn’t want to do that.Around this time, she said she started researching “car life” and “loved what I was seeing,” adding, “I just thought, ‘Wow, I could do that. I could do this, I think.’”“I ended up in my car and it’s been, like I said, 3 years,” she continued before revisiting what had occurred with the former co-manager.“I knew he was playing games and I wasn't the one… Sometimes I think people want to trap you and keep you in a situation where you’re vulnerable and depending on them, and I wasn’t the one,” Robinson said. “So yeah, I got out of there.”Now, Robinson is living in her car in Malibu. Although she didn’t elaborate much in regard to her routine while living in her car, she did share that she has a gym membership that she uses to shower.She also shared how she’s navigated living in her car, saying, “I got to know what to do in my car and how to do it, like how to cover my windows and you don’t talk to certain people.”“You’re careful of telling people that you’re alone, as a woman especially, and I’m a celebrity — I don’t just divulge that to people. If you don’t know who I am, I’m not telling you that part,” she continued.She also assured fans that there was nothing to be concerned about with what she was doing.“This is not like, ‘Oh my God, poor Dawn. She’s living in her car and it’s terrible and woe is me.’”“I’m learning about who I am, I’m learning myself as a person, as a woman,” she continued. “If you would have said to me while I was in En Vogue, ‘You’re going to be living in your car one day,’ I would have been like, ‘Huh? No, I’m always going to have an apartment. I can’t live in my car. How can I do that?’ We say that we can’t do certain things before we even know we’re capable.”Toward the end of the video, Robinson also said that she’s making a documentary about her experience, as well as dismissed the notion that revealing that she lives in her car is a “publicity stunt.”“It is not something that I would have chosen but I’m glad that I put myself out here,” she said. “I’m glad that I did it.”Both fans and fellow industry figures expressed support to Robinson both on YouTube and Instagram, where she posted about the episode. Among them was rapper E-40, who commented, “Check your DM.”\n\n“You guys, for the past almost 3 years, I have been living in my car. I said it!

        "description": "Amid his upcoming trial in May,Diddyhas now alleged that the video footage showing him assaulting ex-girlfriend Cassie that was obtained by CNN “was substantially altered in significant respects” by the news network.\nAccording toUSA Today, a joint letter from Diddy’s defense team and prosecutors was sent to a judge, where it alleges that “a forensic video analysis of the CNN footage” showed it was “substantially altered in significant respects.”\nThe letter goes on to claim thatCNNcovered the time stamp and changed the video sequence, as well as sped up the footage to “make it falsely appear that the actions in the video are taking place faster than they are,”Deadlinereported.\n“Finally, the defense has confirmed that CNN purchased the only known copy of the Hotel’s surveillance footage, uploaded that footage into a free editing software, altered the video; and then destroyed the original footage even though it knew about and repeatedly reported about the federal investigation,” the letter alleges, according to Deadline.\nCNN denied the claims in the letter, with a spokespersontelling theNew York Post, “CNN never altered the video and did not destroy the original copy of the footage, which was retained by the source. CNN aired the story about the video several months before Combs was arrested.”\nLast year, CNN shared the video that showed Diddy assaulting Cassie Ventura at a hotel in March 2016. Shortly after the video surfaced, Diddyissued an apologythrough Instagram.\nThePostreported that the letter was filed in Diddy’s criminal sex-trafficking case in Manhattan federal court Thursday, and noted that the disgraced Bad Boy Records founder was due to appear in court Friday for a hearing in the case.\nHe remains behind bars as he awaits trial, and has been denied bail multiple times.",

        "title": "Kevin Hart's 'Lil Kev' Showrunners Talk Bringing the Heart to the New Animated Series",
        "description": "ToMatthew Claybrooks, comparingKevin Hart’sLil Kevto other Black animated TV series is more pet peeve than intellectual exercise. After working the comedy alongside fellow executive producer Michael Price and Hart for close to a decade, he’s come to understand the series as something that stands apart from any other creation in the Black animation canon.\n“I loveThe Proud Familyand I loveThe Boondocks,” he tells Okayplayer. “But for those series, the father is the main character of the show. On our show we have the first lead woman; she's the head of the household.”\nHaving debuted on March 6 on BET+,Lil Kevfollows the exploits of Kevin Hart’s matriarch mother, Nancy, and 12-year-old Kevin himself as they navigate a colorful family and the hilarious — and, sometimes grim — reality of growing up in North Philadelphia in the early ‘90s. Featuring the talents of Wanda Sykes (“Nancy”), Deon Cole (“Uncle Richard, Jr.), and legendary voice actor Cree Summer (“Gerald”), and Hart himself, the show is a mix of hilarity and heartfelt moments — big on talent and ambition.\nAs Claybrooks alludes to, there’s a temptation to compare the series to other shows centering on Black teens and pre-teens. This one has coming-of-age elements, to be sure. But Price says that, despite that, its gritty backdrop further distinguishes it from contemporaries and Black comedies past.\n“It easily could have been a much softer kind of show, because the main character is a 12-year-old kid,” Price says. “But he lives in a very rough adult real place. So we didn't want to shy away from that.”\nIn conversation with OKP, Claybrooks and Price don’t shy away from anything as they break down the inner workings ofLil Kev.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nOkayplayer: You guys started talking about this show in 2016. What took so long for it to come out?\nMatthew Claybrooks:To this day, I don't understand it. I mean, you have a show with Kevin Hart, Wanda Sykes, Deon Cole at one point, Chris Rock was on board with a cast like that. To me, it's a slam dunk. But it needed to find the perfect home. And I think that's why it took a long time. We did different versions of this thing, super squeaky, clean network cable. What was the network that imploded, Michael?\nMichael Price:Quibi.\nMC:And that was a totally different shortform version of this. So we know this show like the backs of our hands because we made so many different versions of it. But when we pitched it to BET, they got us completely and we were like, “Wow, we get to make the show we really want to make, which is no holds barred, how Kevin really grew up, because if it was on network, it would've been sanitized and it would be a whole different show.” So sometimes when you wait and it doesn't work out early, it actually works out better at the end.\nWhat was the process of depicting 1993 North Philadelphia for the show?\nMC:We have an amazing animation team, Shadow Machine andMusa Brooker. They really took us through and showed us different outfits on characters, how colors looked against their skin, different things like that where we really could see, we told them we want it to be authentically that era, “so it should look like that, that building should look like that.” And Musa, our supervising director, happens to be from Philadelphia as well. So he knew how it looked growing up. I took a trip there, went around Kevin's neighborhood [to see for myself]. In fact, I told Michael when I went to Kevin's neighborhood, I thought I had every intention of walking around. But we got there and I was actually frightened to get out of the car because it was pretty brutal, at least that day. I saw a couple of drug deals going down. Then I saw Kevin's big mural on his old building. I just had so much more respect for Kevin because I saw where he came from and it was like, “Wow, we have to capture this in some kind of way.” And because of Mu and because of all that and seeing pictures and figuring it out, I think we came up with a look of the show that we all are happy with.\nMP:We have an amazing team: directors Musa , Aaron, and Marie; they're all just incredible animation veterans. But our crew, most of the main animation crew, is Black. Most of the writing staff too. It's all just a chance to really, really celebrate Kevin and his neighborhood and his culture, but also the entire culture of the time and just a chance to really have these kinds of voices in a primetime animated show, which there aren't. I think probably The Boondocks, well aside fromEverybody Hates Chris, is oneof the last ones to do that. So it's just a huge honor to work with everyone and work with Matt to bring that vision to reality.\nWhere did you get the ideas for the episodes?\nMP:We watched everything that Kevin has done and we read his book and when we had a chance, we spoke to him. And it all takes me back to a meeting we had many years ago, way back when we were first coming up with this. One of the other producers on the show is Jeff Khan. He was very close with Kevin and he summarized what we were sort of figuring out, okay, what's the show really going to be about? And I think that's what stuck with us forever is that, especially like Matt mentioned growing up in a very rough time, in a very rough neighborhood that Kevin Hart, the kid, and even now, Kevin Hart, the superstar now just has this incredible sense of goodwill and optimism and belief in himself. And that's what hit on what our show is about, is about this kid who lives in a very difficult place and it would be easy to sort of give into despair or to give into all the temptations of the street drugs or crime.\n\nBut his optimism and his faith in himself kind of shined through. And that became, and on top of that, he has a mom, of course, based on Kevin's real mom, although we changed a few small details here and there who loved and wanted him to succeed, but also at the same time was very much worried about keeping him safe. So that became the tug of war. That tug of war between Kevin and his mom is sort of what animates every story more or less in the show. Every story has to do with Kevin and his mom and just that feeling of a tough mom who wants to keep her son safe and a ball of energy and optimism, who wants to break out and live a great life. And that's what became the comic tension of the whole show. And that's where so many stories just came out of that central relationship.\nMC:It’s just like Michael said, all of his specials, we digested that. Our writing staff took it in, read the book. He had a little documentary. I had the pleasure of going on tour a little bit. I worked with Chris Rock and we did a joint thing with 15 shows with Kevin. And I was able to spend a little bit more time with [Kevin Hart] in that way. So we wanted the show to really feel and have the true essence of who Kevin is, and what he brought to the stage because he created a lot of these characters on stage, like “Uncle Richie, Jr.” His mom. We saw an interview with Conan O'Brien where he talked about his brother. We use that information. So we did our research on Kevin, and hopefully if we get into season two, we'd love to sit down with Kevin for an hour. He's the busiest man in the world. I've never seen a busier human being, so it's hard to get his time. But he loves the show, so we're hoping to get some time and really go through what happened here, what happened there and that kind of thing.\nHow did you guys end up choosing Wanda Sykes to play the role of Kevin’s mother?\nMC:Wanda. First off, in my opinion, Wanda is a top five comedian of all time. I think she's brilliant. I don't know how anybody doesn't think Wanda Sykes is hilarious. Her voice is so unique when you hear it. She has these few people in the world like Kevin, I mean Kevin, Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes. They just have these voices that you hear and you can remember it. It's so distinctive. And she has a forceful voice\nAnd a mother in this neighborhood has to be forceful with her kids. And I remember at one of the places we were developing, one of their suggestions was to get let's recast Wanda because they thought her voice was too harsh and Michael and I lost our shit. We were like, what? Wanda Sykes is the best, and having her in the cast is having an extra writer because she always comes up with new jokes in the booth. So it's like, man, we got four or five jokes that we didn't have in the script just from her. So she's amazing. But yeah, they were like, her voice is too, I think the mother should sound more loving. And we're like, “That is love in the hood, keeping your kids alive.” And luckily when that went up the food chain to Kevin and Kevin was like, “No, we're keeping Wanda.” So he fought for her and we weren't going to lose Wanda. She's like, I can't think of another, I can't think of a better voice.\nWhy should people check out your new show? What makes it different?\nMC:What makes it different than any other show? It's a family show, so we've seen family shows, but this one has the mom be the lead, be the head of household driving force for the family, I feel like that makes it unique because we've seen other adult animated shows and the wife is always kind of like, she's not driving the car. And I loveFamily Guy, I loveThe Simpsons, evenThe PJs, it was “Thurgood”, which is a guy type of thing. So to have a woman character, not unlike a lot of times in the inner city or in working class neighborhoods where it's a single mom, I feel like that makes us unique. I feel like we go there where it's real, it's grounded in reality even though it's silly at different times, it's grounded in reality.\nI feel like it has heart. I feel like there's some episodes you could literally cry on. I think that happens. And we wanted that. I love that about Pixar where it's so funny, but it gives you an emotional tug here and there because that's what life really is. And then I think we have, like I said earlier, we have the most collection of funny people ever assembled. It's like theSuper FriendsorX-Menor something. Everybody is funny. And then, we have the wonderful Cree Summer who's an amazing, veteran voice actress. I think the show is unique. I don't think we've seen an adult animated black series like this. I mean there wasThe Cleveland Show, but this isTheCleveland Showon steroids.",

        "description": "The2025 Oscarstook place on Sunday and came with a handful of notable moments. There were the wins, including Zoe Saldana for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first American of Dominican origin to win the honor. There were jokes from host Conan O’Brien, particularly that one aboutDrake(more on that later). And there were the red carpet encounters that took place before the ceremony even began (looking at you, Halle Berry).\nWhether you watched this year’s Academy Awards or not, here were the top five moments from the event.\nHalle Berry Gets Payback For 2003 Adrien Brody Kiss\nHalle Berry played the long game. Twenty-two years after Adrien Brody surprised her with an onstage kiss at the 2003 Oscars, Berry finally returned the favor and planted a kiss of her own on the actor on the Oscar’s red carpet.\nBrody had first kissed Berry after winning the Best Leading Actor Oscar for his performance inThe Pianist, telling her after the kiss, “I bet they didn’t tell you that was in the gift bag.”\nAs for getting her lick back, Berry said she only went in for the kiss because Brody’s girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, “was fine” with her doing it.\n“I’ve been waiting to get him on a red carpet and slap one on,” Berrysaid of the moment to Extra.\n\nCynthia Erivo Belts Out An Incredible Rendition Of “Defying Gravity”\nAlongsideWickedco-star Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo performed “Defying Gravity,” with Grande stepping to the side to let Erivo hit her final note of the song.\nThe Best Actress nominee also performed “Home” from the 1975 musicalThe Wiz.\n\nPaul Tazewell Becomes First Black Man To Win Best Costume Award\nPaul Tazewell, the costume designer behind Wicked, took home the award for Best Costume Design — making him the first Black man to receive the honor.\n“I’m the first black man to receive the costume design award … I’m so proud of this,” Tazewell said during his acceptance speech.\nHe is the second Black person to win the award for Best Costume Design. Ruth E. Carter became the first when she won in 2018 for her work onBlack Panther, and went on to win the honor again in 2022 forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nConan O’Brien\nHosting the Oscars isn’t easy, but at as roasted attending celebs and moved the show along, \nConan O’Brien certainly made it look that way. At one point, he made time to poke fun at Adam Sandler’s casual drop (a hoodie and shorts is a little um, … casual). At another, he  joked, “Well, we’re halfway through the show, so now’s the time for Kendrick Lamar to come out and call Drake a pedophile.”\n\n“Don’t worry, I’m lawyered up,” he added.\nOf course, O’Brien wasn’t just referring to Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” where the West Coast rapper calls Drake a “certified pedophile,” but also Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime performance, where he teased “Not Like Us” multiple times throughout his set before finally performing it (while notably omitting the “pedophile” lyric).\nHis jokes kept the momentum going throughout the night. Here’s to hoping he can host again.\n\nQuincy Jones Gets A Touching Tribute\nWhoopi Goldberg and Oprah introduced a tribute to the late, great Quincy Jones, which encompassed dancers, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Queen Latifah performing “Ease on Down the Road” fromThe Wiz. Jones supervised the adaptation of songs for the film.\n“When we talk about Black excellence, we’re talking about Quincy,”Goldberg saidof the legendary music producer prior to the tribute.",

        "description": "After a valiant run to keep the injury-riddledDallas Mavericksin the playoff race,Kyrie Irving’sseason has come to an end. Earlier today,ESPN’s Senior NBA Insider Shams Charaniareported that Irving suffered a torn ACL during the first half of the Mavericks’ Monday night game against the Sacramento Kings. He will not return this season.\nDuring the first quarter, Irving fell to the floor after a hard drive to the basket. After laying on the floor in visible discomfort, teammates helped Irving walk to the foul line to take his two free throws. After making them both, he left the game.\nIrving’s injury puts the Mavs’ playoff hopes in increased jeopardy. At the moment, the team is playing without both its starting centers (Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II) and two power forwards (Anthony Davis and PJ Washington). Davis, who was traded for Luka Doncic and Max Christie last month, has been out since suffering a left adductor strain against the Houston Rockets on February 8.This isn’t the first major injury of Irving’s career — he broke his kneecap during Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals and a shoulder impingement ended his season after 20 games in 2019-2020 — he is now several years older with more mileage on his body. He faces a recovery period that should be at least nine months. Now, the NBA community, as well as fans across the globe, will wait patiently for his return.\nIrving’s injury puts the Mavs’ playoff hopes in increased jeopardy.

Cappadonna and Young Dirty Bastard, the son of the late Ol’ Dirty Bastard, will also be accompanying the legendary rap group for the special occasion.Seeing all original Wu members perform together has been a rarity as they’ve all gone on to embark on other endeavors.In an interview with the Detroit Metro Timesfrom 2018, Inspectah Deck spoke on this, saying, “It used to be a rarity, but in the last three to five years, it’s been more common, because we understand the importance of what we’re doing, and everybody is putting their futures in perspective.”“Wu-Tang is big — it's bigger than us,” he added. “We started off as just a bunch of guys from the neighborhood; now it’s around the world. It's about our legacy and what we mean to people.”The tour, dubbedWu-Tang Forever: The Final Chamber, begins June 6 in Baltimore and ends July 18 in Philadelphia. The group will be touring with Run the Jewels.Elsewhere in hisPopcastinterview, RZA shared how he had already planned for this tour well before it happened.“It all was part of a plan,” he said. “In the beginning, there was a five-year plan. This time, there was two five-year plans. You have to start the first plan — the documentary to get to the series — and then that’s going to build up to the first tour, New York State of Mind, with Nas.

        "description": "Boxing league COO Lindiwe Mkhwanaz wants to take aboxing teamto an all-women’s championship tournament in Nigeria. The only problem? Her all-male board doesn’t want her to. Their problem? She’s not going to give them a choice.\nThat battle of wits and wills is at the heart ofPound 4 Pound, a new drama set to premiere onBETtomorrow (Feb. 26) at 10 p.m. EST. Powered by a charismatic veteran cast and a script that tightropes comedy and drama, the South African-set series explores themes of resilience and redemption with a narrative efficiency and an unsparing eye for humanity.\nYesterday, I took in a special screening for the first two episodes of the show, which stars Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa as “Lindiwe Mkhwanaz,” whose late father is a famed local boxing coach. While she’s technically the COO of the National Boxing Federation of South Africa, the organization is a misogynistic one, and her own admirable, but unsanctioned staging of an unofficial boxing match gets her fired from the gig. After some savvy media maneuvering, she’s reinstated, but that’s just the beginning of her journey which could take her … well, everywhere, including to the depths of career ruin. But, as someone who wants proper attention for the world of women’s boxing, it’s a worthwhile risk.\nI didn’t get the chance to sit with it for days on end, but my first thoughts were that Mlotshwa really holds things down in the lead role. Her balance of levity, solemn determination, and tightly modulated twitchy facial expressions bring authentic depth to an ambitious dreamchaser on the warpath against injustice, and perhaps, some of her own demons.\nThen there’s Mduduzi Mabaso Mdakane as “DINGAAN ‘TIGER’ NKOSI,” a disgraced boxer with a chance to redefine his legacy after his own drunk driving accident ended his career years ago. Thus far, he’s mostly been moping around in the ashes of his past glory, and Mdakane brings a quiet intensity that evokes that struggle.\nBy the end of the second episode, Lindiwe and TIGER appear on the verge of a new partnership, which will see TIGER assume the role of the coach. Now, all they’ve got to do is find a team. How will that go? We’ll just have to wait and see.\nYou can check out the journey for yourself on BET tomorrow night.",

On Tuesday evening, a jury found Rocky not guilty on two counts of first-degree assault with a semiautomatic weapon.\n\"A jury has ACQUITTED A$AP Rocky of two counts of first-degree assault with a semiautomatic firearm for his Nov. 6, 2021, confrontation with Terell \"Relli\" Ephron in Hollywood,\" reads court reporter Meghann Cuniff's tweets announcing the verdict, the reading of which was streamed on Law&Crime Trials on YouTube. \"The verdict is he's NOT GUILTY on both counts. Rocky was accused of shooting one-time associate Terell “Relli” Ephron on November 6, 2021.\"\nFor the entire case, Rocky and his defense insisted that he used a fake gun and accused Ephron of perjury. Throughout the trial, Rocky's defense team found multiple inconsistencies in his case. While one juror told Cuniff that most of the jury believed that Rocky had fired an actual gun at Ephron, there wasn't enough evidence for them to find Rocky guilty of the crime.\nFollowing the announcement of the verdict, Rocky gave thanks to God and jurors for the outcome. \"I really want to thank the jury for making the right decision. I'm just so thankful, this is crazy right now,\" Rocky said. \"This whole experience has been crazy for the past four years but I'm thankful, nonetheless, I'm thankful and I'm blessed to be here right now, to be a free man talking to y'all right now.\"\nWatch Rocky's post-verdict speech for yourself below.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n\n",

        "description": "Despite previous reports that Marvel Studios was considering recasting the role ofBlack Panther’s T’Challa, a producer for the upcoming third film in the franchise has said that such discussions haven’t happened yet.\nIn a recent interview with ComicBook.com, Nate Moore, a longtime Marvel executive who announced he’d be leaving the studio last year, dismissed claims that bringing a new T’Challa into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was in the works.\n“The truth is, there’s no truth to those rumors. Never say never to anything, we haven’t really had a lot of creative conversations with Ryan Coogler yet, because he’s finishing his filmSinners, which comes out this year,” Moore said. “We’ll get into it later this year, but everything you read online is not true, if for no other reason than we just haven’t started [working on it].”\nMoore, who’ll be remaining with Marvel Studios through mid-March of this year, will be serving as a producer onBlack Panther 3. When his upcoming departurewas reported byVariety, Kevin Feige shared a statement extending praise toward Moore, while also confirming that anotherBlack Pantherinstallment was happening.\n“Nate is a fantastic executive and colleague as well as a wonderful friend to all of us here at Marvel Studios,” Feige said. “He has been a core member of our team since 2010, and his influence will continue to reverberate in our storytelling. Although we’ll miss him a great deal, we look forward to watching what he does next while also having the good fortune of working with him in a new way on our nextBlack Panthermovie.”\nLast month, entertainment journalist Jeff Sneiderreported through his InSneider newsletterthat Marvel Studios was finally “firmly open” to recasting T’Challa. The character was famously played by the late Chadwick Boseman, who made his introduction as the hero of Wakanda in 2016’sCaptain America: Civil War.",

        "title": "The Triumph of Irv Gotti",
        "description": "Irv Gotti’s death at 54 is a shock for anyone who worked with him and for anyone who lived through the man’s musical heyday. The Queens native had been fairly open about his health struggles in recent years, explaining that his diabetes was “deteriorating” his body during a2023 Drink Champs interview.\nMurder Inc’s success in the early 2000s put the label at the forefront of popular culture. With Irv Gotti steering the ship, Ja Rule and Ashanti became fixtures on the charts, scoring inescapable hits like “Mesmerize” and “Always On Time,” the kind of infectious smashes that were ready made for “urban” programming rotations.\nIt was the vision of the man born Irving Lorenzo Jr; a Hollis Queens product who teamed up with his brother Chris to bum rush the cutthroat music business. As “DJ Irv” he handled production for rhymer Mic Geronimo before changing his name to the more ambitious “Gotti”—egged on by Brooklynite Jay-Z at the height of hip-hop’s mafioso infatuation.\nLike his namesake, one of Irv Gotti’s strengths was his brashness. He saw the brass ring as hip-hop became big business—and he eagerly reached for it. When Gotti met Def Jam impresario Lyor Cohen, he made it clear that he was coming for Cohen’s spot.\n\"I'm gonna become you, and I'll destroy you,\"Gotti recalled in 2002. \"I'm from the 'hood. You can't know more about hip-hop than me.\"\nThe musical legacy of Irv Gotti is virtually indisputable. Whatever one thinks of the so-called “Shiny Suit Era,” it’s clear that Gotti saw a way to capitalize on the rap game’s newfound gloss without compromising street authenticity. Gotti never apologized for wanting to sell and sellbig—he just saw a different way to do it. At a time when flashy videos and Bee Gees samples were surefire ways to multiplatinum success, it was Irv Gotti who championed DMX’s dark, soul-stirring music to Def Jam. It was Irv Gotti who spearheaded the deal that brought Jay-Z and Roc-a-fella Records under the Def Jam banner in the late ‘90s, the period that saw the Brooklyn rap legend begin his musical and cultural ascendancy.\n\"People get confused because it sells like pop music,” Gottitold The Guardian in 2002. “But we make Black music first and foremost, and all our records is 'hood first.’”\nThat doesn’t mean there weren’t growing pains. Murder Inc’s offices were famously busted in January 2003—with Irv and Chris staring down RICO charges at the height of the label’s commercial success and accused of alleged ties with Queens drug kingpin Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff. The Lorenzo brothers were charged with money laundering but were later acquitted of all charges. “I’m overjoyed,”Gottistated after acquittal. “In this case, the government had it 100 percent wrong. They went after me because of someone I know. I would never have worked this hard, from nothing to having millions of dollars, to jeopardize it with something stupid or illegal.”\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nThere was the conflict with fellow Queens native 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew—whose rise seemed to precipitate Murder Inc’s decline. Gotti would later reveal an ill-advised relationship with Ashanti that went bad, and he ran into litigation that put him against Cohen. And there was the scourge of changing times. Rebranded as “The Inc” following Gotti’s acquittal, the label would sign R&B crooner Lloyd and singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlson; Irv and Chris diversified into movie production, fashion and even boxing promotion. Through the ups and downs, Gotti’s ambitions never waned.\nOver the years Gotti would use television to cement his legacy; most notably with 2022’s “The Murder Inc Story.” The docuseries brought Gotti’s legacy into sharp relief for a new generation—highlighting the roller coaster run that saw chart topping successes for the label. But Gotti’s health had been a cause for concern in recent years. Reports of a stroke in 2024 followed pictures of the mogul walking with a cane; and in the days leading up to his death, there were reports he’d suffered a second stroke. As news of his passing broke, hip-hop luminaries acknowledged his pivotal life.\n“Def Jam Recordings and the extended Def Jam family of artists, executives, and employees, are deeply saddened at the loss of Irv Gotti,” the label posted on Instagram. “His creative genius and unwavering dedication to the culture birthed countless hits, defining an era of music that continues to resonate with fans worldwide. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and all those who were touched by his work.”\n“What a Genius,” wrote Fat Joe on Instagram. “God bless you irv ty for all you’ve done for Hip Hop. You changed my life and i will always love you RIP.”\nGotti’s role in shaping 90s and 2000s music is forever etched in our collective consciousness. As a producer, he had an undeniable ear, as a mogul, he embodied unfettered ambition. Irv Gotti’s legacy is no cautionary tale. His mistakes were laid bare for the world to see, but his rise served as an inspiration for a generation that followed in his wake. His death at 54 is a sad and shocking turn of events. But his life was a triumph of spirit.",

        "description": "Among the flurry of celebrities jumping on the skincare bandwagon, Lil Waye might have just topped them all. Pulling a move no one saw coming, Wayne casually announced his forthcoming albumTha Carter VIin the last few seconds of a Cetaphil commercial. Known for his offbeat genius, the rap legend revealed that the highly anticipated project drops June 6, 2025. Sources at Republic Records confirmed the news withRolling Stone. The LP will mark Weezy’s 14th studio album and first solo release in five years.\nAhead of Super Bowl LVIII,Wayne had fans buzzingafter revealing he wouldn’t be attending the game. Instead, he teased something “very special” in the works. Turns out, that “something” was a clever marketing play. While many expected him to take center stage at the halftime show, the spot ultimatelywent to Kendrick Lamar. But Wayne made his own moment.\nTheCetaphil adhilariously makes fun of Wayne’s “sensitive” side—both emotionally and, apparently, dermatologically. The tagline? “We’re all a lil sensitive.” Subtle dig? Maybe. But fans quickly picked up on the hidden details. Throughout the ad, the numbers six and 25 pop up repeatedly—on jerseys, a scoreboard—before the final reveal: a sign on Wayne’s studio door reading, “Do Not Disturb ’til 06-06-25. Carter VI.”\nIt’s peak Weezy: unexpected, smart, and totally on his terms with a brand partnership to boot. While some may still be salty he wasn’t part of the Super Bowl line-up, he made it clear—he doesn’t need a halftime show to stir buzz.\n- YouTubeyoutu.be",

        "description": "Following his incredible Super Bowl halftime performance, streams forKendrick Lamar’s monumental Drake diss track, “Not Like Us,” have spiked quite a lot.\nAccording toVariety, streams for the song increased by 430% on Spotify. The streaming service also provided more information about Lamar’s streaming bumps after the game via its Spotify News account on Instagram.\nIn a post on the social media platform, Spotify News wrote, “Following Sunday’s halftime performance, streams of Kendrick Lamar’s music increased by nearly 175 percent on Spotify in the U.S.”\nThe account also shared that several other songs from the West Coast rapper saw spikes in their streams as well, including: “HUMBLE.,” “All the Stars,” “man at the garden,” “DNA,” “euphoria,” “squabble up” and others.\nSee on InstagramMany of these songs were the ones Lamar performed on Sunday, although “Not Like Us” was potentially the only one fans were anticipating. After teasing it a couple of times during his set, theGNXrapper finally performed it — and didn’t hold back on reciting the track’s most scathing lyrics against Drake.Prior to the halftime show, Lamar teased that “storytelling” would be a part of the performance, sayingduring an Apple Music press conference, “I’ve always been very open about storytelling through all my catalog and my history of music, and I’ve always had a passion about bringing that on whatever stage I’m on.

        "description": "Welp, he really did it.\nTaking the stage at Caesars Superdomeduring halftime for Super Bowl LIX, Kendrick Lamar put on a predictably electric performance. The highlight, of course, unfolded when he performed hisepic Drake diss, “Not Like Us.”On a somewhat unexpected note, he didn’t really hold back on any of the Drake shots.\nBefore performing the track, Kendrick teased it with a snarky quip: \"I want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue.\" If you recall, Drake filed a lawsuit against UMG earlier this year, accusing the label, one he’s been signed to in some way shape or form for over a decade, was using bots to increase streams for “Not Like Us,” a track that calls Drake a pedophile.\nSee on Instagram\nWith this in mind, there was plenty of speculation about whether Kendrick would perform the track at the Super Bowl. He did, and, notably, he didn’t censor himself much at all, rapping his famous, “A-minor” lyric in its totality. In another big surprise, he had Serena Williams pull up to Crip Walk onstage during the performance. If you've been following Drake for a while, you know they used to date, and Drake used a song on his and 21 Savage's joint album,Her Loss, to come at her husband.\nThe trolling didn't stop there, either. Fans were also quick to note the lowercase A chain he was wearing onstage, linking it to his \"A-minor\" line he directed at Drizzy.\nElsewhere in the performance, Kendrick performed \"Euphoria,\" \"Peakaboo,\" \"Loyalty,\" \"DNA\" and more.\nWatch some of the performance for yourself below.",

        "title": "How Kendrick Lamar Reached the Highest Rap Peak of the Past 25 Years",
        "description": "There are exceptions, but battle raps aren’tsupposedto be hit records. Sure, they’re designed to get attention, but by nature, they’re coarse diatribes conceived for the purpose of their targets’ destruction; loud shouts, sickle cell jokes and taunts to enemies who aren’t alive to hear them. Harnessing hyphy’s kinetic energy, a decade of animosity, and the instincts of atruemaster manipulator,Kendrick Lamarpushed the concept of a commercial diss song to its upper extreme for “Not Like Us,” an astute character assassination packaged in all the infectiousness of “Started From the Bottom.” It’s“Hit Em Up”and “Sicko Mode” at the same time; a venomous barrage of insults rendered with the stickiness of a DrizzyDrakesing-a-long. It’s as much a technical wonder as a paradox: Adiss trackwon aGrammy for Song of the Year.Record of the Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song and Best Music Video, too. When Kendrick performs at Caesars Superdome for Super Bowl LIX this weekend, it will be the punctuating victory lap in a year filled with them. By becoming the best battle rapper, the best hitmaker, and being recognized for both simultaneously, Kendrick has enjoyed the most dominant rap peak of the millennium.\nKung Fu Kenny’s opening act was nearly as cinematic as his finale. Popping out for a completely unexpected guest verse onFutureandMetro Boomin’s“Like That,” he sniped would-be rivals Drake andJ. Colein a scathing response to their 2023 collab, “First Person Shooter.” Everyone came to play here. Metro Boomin’s\"Everlasting Bass\"andEazy-E flipwere masterful. Hendrix’s hook was indelible. And yet Kendrick’s sneering warning shot was apex theater. It was the best kind of show-stealing. The result was rap history — or rather, a rewriting of it. With a barrage of jittery syllables, Kendrick defiled a rap continuum that stretched back to the blog era:“Motherfuck the Big 3, nigga, it’s just big me.”The proclamation turned “Like That” into a moment rather than just a great song, and predictably, it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. And that was just scene one.\nWhile it’s hard to remember that the battle was initially competitive, subsequent acts played out with the same sense of drama. A few weeks later, Drake countered with “Push Ups,” a virtuosic turn that saw the 6ix God disarm and dismember enemies with all the icy precision ofThe Equalizer. His follow-up, the questionable, if funny, “Taylor Made Freestyle,” saw Drake use 2Pac and Snoop Dogg AI effects to subject Kendrick to a condescending lecture from his own West Coast heroes. Two weeks later, Kendrick clapped back with “Euphoria,” only to follow up with “6:16 in LA” a few days later. Shifting between playful and pensive, Kendrick warned Drake to keep things light. With his ferocious Kendrick diss, “Family Matters,” Drake ignored Kenny’s advice. And then, as the sky turned pitch black, Kendrick grew darker, still.Moments after Drake’s diabolical assassination attempt, Kendrick responded with “Meet The Grahams,” a soul-skinning exorcism that could only come from the hearts of the truly sinister. Wielding trembling vocals and ill intent, Kendrick painted Drake as an alcoholic sex addict without the upbringing to be a good father, framing the first verse as a letter to Drake’s son Adonis. Then he left letters to Drake’s parents. And then, a daughter that likely doesn’t exist. This wasn’t below the belt as much as it was beneath the Earth. This wasn’t a critique; it was cosmic condemnation. Then, Kendrick decided it was time to party.Released less than a full day after “Meet The Grahams,” “Not Like Us” was the real-life version of, “I’ll kill you, commit suicide, then kill you again.” It wasAlex Murphy getting shot the fuck upinRobocop. It was gruesome as gruesome gets. It was also an undeniable and indestructible slap — modernized Cali bounce Kendrick turns into a funhouse. Each succeeding couplet is more searing than the next, and the twitchy cadences make calling Drake a pedophile a phonetic adventure. Kamala Harris used it at one of her campaign rallies. Black grandmas rapped it at family cookouts. White grandmas, too.To date, it’s got over1 billion Spotify streams. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It did numbers. Aside from that, it proved a nearly inconceivable mastery of craft. Nominally, “Meet The Grahams” and “Not Like Us” are both rap songs. But shifting from Alchemist production to a Mustard soundscape — from long-winded personal messages to jumpy Instagram captions — Kendrick might as well have been operating in two completely different genres. He madeThe GodfatherandTopGun:Maverick. He created them both just days apart.And somehow, those elements might not even be the most impressive parts of the songs. The true success of “Not Like Us” lies in its existential irritation. The hook is symbolic enough to be appropriated by anyone who wants to call another Drake — their Drake, your Drake, my Drake, Kendrick’s Drake — a culture vulture. As the world, and veteran Drake enemyPusha Tnote, it was enough to spur some unprecedented legal action that was… well, unprecedented.“I think what Kendrick was doing was really talking to his soul,” Pushexplained to Ari Melber.“I believe that would cause you to tap out, that would cause you to sue, that would cause you to do a lot of things. It’s crazy.”As Push alludes to, Drake ended up filing a lawsuit against Universal Music Group, accusing the label, which remains home to himself and Kendrick, of using bots to artificially inflate numbers for “Not Like Us.” Drake might never say he lost this battle, but the lawsuit is more emphatic than any hollow concessions. Not only did he lose badly in the actual battle. He was also a poor sport. He was the worst sport. We all laughed about Drake turning Meek into a meme. But Kendrick accomplished something even more extraordinary: He turned Drake into a Karen.That feat of alchemy only punctuated one chapter of his world-conquering saga, which, of course, carried through the rest of 2024 and beyond. His L.A. Pop Out concert turned a Drizzy funeral into a gang peace summit. “Not Like Us” basically madeJAY-Zgive Kendrick a slot as the Super Bowl halftime show headliner. Then Kendrick dropped the best rap album of the year.Released in November,GNXsaw Kenny triple-down on the bangers, an underrated specialty his opponents somehow suggested he wasn’t capable of. For “Hey Now,” Kendrick threads classic hyphy withDrakeo The Ruler-inspired vocal inflections and a hook that’s simultaneously playful and menacing. This wasn’t a ready-made anthem, either. Mustard toldPeoplehe made the beat five years ago, and he offered it to YG and Quavo long before Kendrick even knew it existed. But Kendrick made it a top-five single. Ditto for theDebbie Deb-sampling “Squabble Up” and “TV Off,” the latter of which is like a “Not Like Us” part two. They went No. 1 and No. 2 on the Hot 100 respectively. Every song on the LP landed on the chart, giving local acts like Jody6, Hitta J3, AzChike Hot 100 placements they could have never dreamed about. Critics like me loved the album, too. ForVariety, I gave it a 92/100. According to music review aggregatorMetacritic, the LP sits at an average score of 87, indicating universal acclaim. All that. Kendrick won big — bigger than any other rapper has in 25 years.To be clear: other superstars have also owned hip-hop. Some for years at a time. But no one’s ever commandeered it so comprehensively. With deft lyricism, dexterous flows, and chameleonic musicality, Drake dominated 2011, 2015 and 2018. But in his first real run, he was plagued by cornball allegations. Then, in 2015 and 2018, he faced ghostwriting accusations, with the latter year seeing him take his second-biggest loss to date. Even if he ensnared fans and critics, that underground fan base was always going to be beyond his reach. After redefining the mixtape imagination between 2005 and 2007, 2008Lil Waynehad a No. 1 hit and multiple other top 10 singles as he continued eviscerating any and every track he approached. But, great asTha Carter IIIwas, many heads (wrongfully) thought “Lollipop” was the sound of a corporate sellout rather than an innovative classic. And though a few people dissed him, he was never presented a worthy enough opponent for a legendary battle.2010’Yehad arguably the best album of the group, but he didn’t battle anybody, and none of hisMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasysingles even reached the top 10 of the Hot 100. As talented as Drake andNicki Minajwere, their styles hadn’t matured enough to be his competition. In 2003,50 Centhad a classic No. 1 album and two No. 1 singles. And yet, he still lost Best New Artist toEvanescenceat the 2004 Grammy Awards. Tracks like “In Da Club” and “21 Questions” proved an unquestioned — almost unnatural — hitmaking mastery. He also beat up on then thug love song kingJa Rulewith a barrage of diss tracks. But Ja isn’t the spitter Drake is, and when 50 accompanied Roc-A-Fella records for theirRoc The Mictour, he wasn’t even the headliner. Kendrick is headlining the Super Bowl.50’s boss couldn’t quite keep up, either. In 2002,Eminemhad a fringe-classic No. 1 album and a No. 1 single. Kendrick had a No. 1 album and three times as many No. 1 singles. Eminem, rap’s ultimate rap battler, also had an awesome biopic about battle rap. Kendrick won the biggest rap battle ever.If Kendrick’s 2024 had to be described as a movie title, it would beEverything, Everywhere, All At Once. He was the ultimate spitter to underground heads on both coasts, yet he had the biggest song of the year. He began 2024 with the No. 1 single only to close it out with a No. 1 album. And another No. 1 single. And several other top 10 singles.

        "title": "The Top 5 Moments From The 2025 Grammy Awards",
        "description": "While the awards show has caught a bunch of flack the last several years, the 2025 Grammys were, in most ways, pretty dope. Over the course of more than three hours, plenty of memorable performances and award announcements unfolded before a lively crowd.\nOr what about the not televised honors, like Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge — as NxWorries — winning Best Progressive R&B Album?\nWell, there were some moments that clearly defined the night’s festivities — and we’re highlighting them here. Here are the top five moments from this year’s Grammys.\n5. Trevor Noah Gets Political\nAs we face an already concerning new presidency, it’s good to have a host that isn’t afraid to acknowledge it. Throughout his introductory speech for the ceremony, Noah made quite a few remarks alluding to Donald Trump’s second term — whether that be the tariffs implemented by him or his immigration policies.\n“There’s been a few changes in Washington, so this may be the last time I get to host anything in this country,” Noah quipped before focusing his attention on the night’s festivities.\n4. Doechii Wins Best Rap Album\nShe was up against some very tough competition — and yet, she came out on top with Alligator Bites Never Heal. Doechii is now the third woman to receive the Best Rap Album award, joining both Cardi B (who present the album to Doechii) and Ms. Lauryn Hill — something the TDE rapper acknowledged while wearing a designer Thom Browne outfit with her mom standing right next to her for support.\n\"This category was introduced in 1989, and two women have won — three women have won! Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii!\" she said.\n“I know that there is some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there that are watching me right now, and I wanna tell you — you can do it,” she added. “Anything is possible, don’t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you … you are exactly who you need to be, to be right where you are, and I am a testimony.”\n3. Janelle Monae Headlines A Phenomenal Quincy Jones Tribute\nIn honor of his passing last year, the Grammys dedicated a performance medley to the legendary Quincy Jones. It was incredible from beginning to end, highlighting just how many musical icons he’s worked with — from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson. And it was that latter artist that Janelle Monae channeled in her performance as part of the medley, performing Jackson’s beloved hit, “Don’t Stop Til’ You Get Enough.” Truly, the footwork is something else.\n2. Kendrick Lamar Wins Record And Song Of The Year\nWhat more needs to be said? He took the stage and won some of the night’s most notable honors courtesy of his diss track, “Not Like Us.”\n\n\tAnd we got to hear the crowd sing “A MINOR” at the top of their lungs, soundtracking Lamar’s walk to the stage as he accepted the Record of the Year award.Clearly, he already had the last laugh in this feud with Drake. But him winning these Grammys solidified that.\n1. Beyoncé FINALLY Won Album Of The Year\n“It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said of the long journey to getting an award that she’s wanted for so long. And now, she’s finally gotten it, her Cowboy Carter album beating out some heavy competition that included Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.\nAnd although she said this during her acceptance speech for Best Country Album, something she said also applies here: “I think sometimes genre is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about. And to stay persistent.”",

        "description": "The rap world loses yet another legend. On Wednesday, Def Jam issued a statement confirming that Murder Inc. Records co-founder Irv Gotti had passed away at the age of 54.\nWhile Def Jam did not disclose a cause of death, Gotti had suffered a stroke early last year, and he had dealt with complications of diabetes in the past.\n“Def Jam Recordings and the extended Def Jam family of artists, executives and employees, are deeply saddened at the loss of Irv Gotti,” reads Def Jam’s statement. “His contributions at Def Jam, as both an A&R executive and in partnership with Murder, Inc., helped pave the way for the next generation of artists and producers, a force that reshaped the soundscape of hip hop and R&B. His creative genius and unwavering dedication to the culture birthed countless hits, defining an era of music that continues to resonate with fans worldwide. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and all those who were touched by his work.”\nBorn Irving Domingo Lorenzo Jr., Gotti used sharp musical and business instincts to cultivate a legacy of creativity and artist development. While he’s most known for introducing the world to Ja Rule and Ashanti, that’s only a part of his legacy. Notably, he producedJAY-Z’sReasonable Doubtclassic, “Can I Live” he alsocultivated a young DMX. As a Def Jam music exec, he helped push the label to its highest commercial heights in the late ’90s and early 2000s. At its peak, Murder Inc. was one of the most successful Black record labels in the industry.\nOKP sends condolences to Gotti’s family. See Def Jam’s statement for yourself below.\nSee on Instagram",

        "description": "After years of perceived snubs, Beyoncé has officially won the Grammy for Album of the Year at the 2025 Grammys. It is her first time winning this particular award.\nHer latest album,Cowboy Carter, was up against André 3000’sNew Blue Sun, Sabrina Carpenter’sShort n’ Sweet, Charli xcx’sBRAT, Jacob Collier’sDjesse Vol. 4, Billie Eilish’sHIT ME HARD AND SOFT, Chappell Roan’sThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princessand Taylor Swift’sThe Tortured Poets Department.

She has won 32 Grammys and has been nominated for 99, making her the most-awarded and most-nominated artist in Grammy history.\nIn November last year, Harvey Mason Jr. the CEO of the Recording Academy (which puts on the Grammys), gave a diplomatic response when asked of Beyoncé’s chances of winning the highly coveted Album of the Year honor.\n“You never know. I believe she has a really good one-in-eight chance. That’s the best answer I can give, only because the voters, you don’t know what they’re going to gravitate to,” he toldThe Hollywood Reporter.“It is tough. Beyoncé has definitely been in the category before, [and she has] some other great competition there. But at the end of the day, the albums in that category are flat out amazing to me. I love all of them, and I’m so happy about where we are. I know somebody’s going to be mad. I know seven people won’t win, and I look forward to seeing the result.”",

Empathy. When managing his own well-being,Dice Rawlooks to the past.\n“I understand the world of yesterday of ’95, I remember the world of 1985,” he shares with Okayplayer. “Understand the world of yesterday while you're in the world of today, because the world has only been like this for five minutes in the big scheme of things. It's been desert and churning your own butter for most of it. Whole Foods and all of this is new.”\nHis musing is a nod to the power of perspective on time, temporality, and opportunity. While he can look to the world of 30 years ago, he can also look to the experiences of strangers or incarcerated friends to help maintain a proper emotional equilibrium. “I try not to let things affect me too much in a negative way,” he says.\nSpeaking with Okayplayer for the latest edition ofPursuit of Happiness, Dice Raw takes a look at how a little intellectual rearrangement helps him process the trauma in his life.\nDice Raw:I grew up in the ’80s where they really hadn't started caring about kids that much. We used to ride on the back of the pickup truck with no seat belts. Talking about your emotions really wasn't even a relevant conversation for men. For men, especially little boys at that time, it was the typical, “You gotta be tough, you got to button up and straighten up.” So that was the premise of it. But I was always encouraged to express myself and say how I felt and had real conversations with my parents that were probably not the typical kid-parent conversation. But we never reached into talking about emotions or even understanding them.\nWhen I was having an issue when I was younger, I didn't even notice it. It was just viewed as just bad behavior. I had a mental health crisis in 2022. I lost my mother and father in the same year. That was a heavy lift for me. And I really had to just think about it. I had to learn. I had to learn what grief is, how it works. It was almost like I had to learn how the world works. Those were major episodes. I got through them with a lot of prayer and meditation.\nIt's all about perspective. No matter what it is, once it's already happened, it's kind of already happened. So how long do we grieve? If something is good, how long do we celebrate? It could be like, “This great thing happened to me 25 years ago. Man, I'm still celebrating.” It's like, what the hell is the matter with you? Similarly, it’s like, “Okay, something bad happened to me 20 years ago and I'm still going through it.” But why? We’ve got to keep those things in mind.\nIt’s all about thoughts. One of my friends, Wallo267, called me from prison. He had been spending his life in prison. He got out of jail, and he went back. He called me one day like, “Yo, man, how you doing, brother?” I said, “I'm okay. I got this going on. I got this problem. I got this other problem. I got that problem.” I said, “How you doing?” He said, “Brother, I'm great.” He was doing another 20-year sentence. That was his perspectivewhilehe was incarcerated.\nAt the end of the day, you woke up today with two hands and two feet and two eyes. You’re inhaling and exhaling air.",

Although no charges were filed against Render he is demanding justice for the very public incident.\nOn Monday, Render filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against security company S&S Labor Force, citing false imprisonment, assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The lawsuit states that Render was leaving the media center after accepting his Grammy and heading to the red carpet when security stopped him. Despite showing identification, he was allegedly detained and physically assaulted.\nIn his 2024 albumMichael & the Mighty Midnight Revival: Songs for Sinners, Render references the event on the track “Humble Me,” making it clear that he believes excessive force was used: “I was sitting there in a room full of cops, like Daniel was sitting with the lions / I had to quiet my mind, I prayed and I prayed and I prayed” The squabble also ignited controversy among fans who felt the backstage drama was racially motivated and put a damper on his much-deserved Grammy win.\nRolling Stone, the company dismissed the allegations as “unfounded” and claimed its security personnel acted within the law and company policy. Render is now seeking a trial and financial compensation for damages.",

        "title": "Will Kendrick Lamar Perform \"Not Like Us\" at Super Bowl LIX?",
        "description": "On February 9,Kendrick Lamarwill take to the field at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome asthe Super Bowl’s halftime performer. And, of course, the one question on everybody’s mind is: Will he perform “Not Like Us”?\nYes, the song that solidified his win against Drake during their feud last year may or may not make an appearance in his setlist. Sure, there are the obvious reasons it should be: it’s a hit and is extremely (at least beat-wise) sports-friendly, serving as a song thatnumerous HBCU bandshave played during games and other events. But there’s also clear reasons why maybe it won’t, particularly in regard to Drake’sfederal lawsuitagainst Universal Music Group (Lamar is not listed as a defendant), which accuses the rapper’s longtime label of defamation for promoting “Not Like Us.” As we all know, the track declares that Drake is a “certified pedophile,” a claim that Drake argues has put him and his family in danger.\nSo, if Lamar decides to perform “Not Like Us” — and actually get to the lyrics where he refers to Drake as a pedophile — during the most watched TV broadcast every year, will he be in trouble?\nWell,according to the Los Angeles Times, which spoke to a First Amendment litigator and criminal defense attorney ahead of the West Coast rapper’s performance, it’s highly unlikely because, even in his lawsuit, he’s blaming UMG rather than Kendrick himself.\n“All he would be able to do is say, ‘UMG promoted this song at the Super Bowl, their hands got Kendrick Lamar the gig.’ It doesn’t seem to increase Lamar’s threat profile much. It’s already a widely known song, so the stance Drake seems to take is, ‘I’m going to go after kind of the unpopular defendant no one likes, a big record label.’”\nAnd what about the NFL or Fox, the TV network that’ll be hosting the Super Bowl game and its halftime show?\n“It increases the damages in theory. But does middle America listening to Kendrick at the Super Bowl really damage Drake’s reputation more than it’s already been damaged? Probably not,” White said. “It does potentially bring in other people who are responsible for helping to publish what he says are false statements. I’m sure the NFL and the network and all have thought about that. It wouldn’t surprise me if they’re trying to stop it from being done at the Super Bowl.”\n“I’m a defense lawyer, so of course I’m going to say, ‘Guys, don’t do this. It’s just going to give me a headache,’” he added. “I’m sure every general counsel with the network or the NFL is saying, ‘No, for the love of God, don’t do it.’ But the halftime show has always been willing to showcase stuff that is somewhat edgy. So I don’t really know how they’ll play it, but if I were an in-house counsel, I’d be telling them not to do it.”\nIt’s worth noting that the NFL apparently doesn’t intend to stop Lamar from performing “Not Like Us” — at least, according to author and media personality Marc Lamont Hill.During a recent episode ofThe Joe Budden Podcast, Hill said that he asked an NFL executive if the football organization was going to “block” theGNXartist from going playing the diss track.\n“What they said was, ‘Kendrick can do whatever he wants at the Super Bowl. The NFL does not control what he does. … We asked Snoop not to crip walk or throw up gang signs. He did it anyway, nobody died,’” Hill said.\nBut also — and as this piece has hinted toward already — even if Lamar does “Not Like Us,” there’s a possibility that he skips over the Drake pedophile lyrics entirely, or figures out a way to allude to them without being overt (which is the chess-level approach to lyrical warfare one would expect from Lamar).\nRegardless, the second Sunday of February is going to be an interesting one, as we await and see if Lamar will perform “Not Like Us,” as well as what the rest of his set will include.\n",

In the landmark story, Cooper paints a lucid portrait of the momentary exhilaration and despair distilled through a drug that was changing Harlem — and the Black community — forever.\n“Crack is the latest drug in New York, and its use is becoming epidemic,” he wrote. “These white pellets of prepackaged freebase (cocaine in its purest form) are extremely frightening. Frequent users – peer-pressured 13-year-olds to 60-plus grandparents – don’t associate its use with the savage addiction of heroin or the hallucinogenic insanity of angel dust, its two predecessors in Harlem’s crippling drug trilogy. But in the last year, crack has become the drug of choice; the exhilarating rush of its 5-to-15-minute high brings a distorted sense of power, a king-of-the-hill nirvana.”\nLateSPINfounder Bob Guccione once opined that Cooper’s clear-eyed commentary on the Uptown crack epidemic was “thefirst major piece ever written about the drug.”\nIt was his writing forThe Village VoiceandSPINthat showed just how percipient Cooper was about the world he’d come from and was now expertly documenting. Andwhen a young musical prodigy from Uptownbegan charting big with Harlem acts like Keith Sweat and Guy, Cooper showed the world the true brilliance of Teddy Riley. He even gave that sound a name, one that would help frame a genre, one of his most iconic films, and contemporary Black culture as the world knew it.\n“It was in Bronx River that the young man mixed rap, gospel, jazz, funk, go-go, and gothic-romanticism by way of synthesizers,” Cooper explained. “After worshiping and playing in several churches, playing and learning in several playgrounds and music classes, he found the elements to put together a totally new form of R&B. I call it ‘the New Jack Swing.’’\nNew jack swing was R&B and hip-hop’s bouncing new baby in the late 80s, and in giving the sound a new name, it announced that the game had changed. This wasn’t your parents’ R&B. It wasn’t even the kinetic electro and freestyle sounds made popular only a few years before. This was the sound of an R&B generation borne of hip-hop—as opposed to R&B attempting to “catch up” to the musical revolution.\nAnd Barry Michael Cooper captured the moment perfectly.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nLater that same year, he wrote “Kids Killing Kids: The New Jack City Eats Its Young.” It was that piece that led to Cooper being tapped by the legendary Quincy Jones to write a screenplay about famed Harlem gangster Nicky Barnes. That script eventually morphed into a fictional drama about a crack kingpin named Nino Brown.New Jack Citywould become Cooper’s first big screen success. The 1991 film starred Wesley Snipes as Nino, and rapper Ice-T, who played the role of a dogged cop desperate to bring him down. The flick was directed by Mario Van Peebles, and it earned over$47 million at the box officeoff of an $8 million budget.\nNew Jack Cityarrived at the dawn of the 1990s “hood movie” wave that saw stories of urban crises told through the lens of the hip-hop generation. The movie made Snipes a bonafide star and set the stage for Cooper’s famed “Harlem Trilogy” to continue with 1994'sSugar Hill,which also starred Snipes. Set in Harlem’s beloved Sugar Hill district, it again features Snipes as a drug lord—albeit a much more reluctant one than the notorious Nino—who has watched drugs destroy his community and his family. Cooper’s stories weren’t afraid to be grim, but he told them with unflinching grace.\nThe basketball dramaAbove The Rimclosed out the “Trilogy” with another look at how drugs infected the community—although this was more indirect. As a high school basketball (Duane Martin) star preps to make the leap to a big college after graduation, he’s tempted by the easy money of playing in street ball tournaments for a murderous kingpin (Tupac Shakur.)\nThose films helped tell the story of Harlem in the 80s and early 90s and they influenced an entire generation watching hip-hop come of age. Cooper would go on to direct indie releases, produce for television (American Gangster)and collaborate with contemporaries like Spike Lee (She’s Gotta Have It.)\nUpon the news of Cooper’s passing, his friend Nelson George reflected on Cooper’s impact on his own career.\n“It'll take me a minute to gather all my thoughts,” Georgewrote. “But just wanted to thank him for recommending [me] to Robert Christgau at theVillage Voicewhen I was trying to write for the Riffs section back in 1981. It was a key moment in my career and life. Barry helped define pop culture in the ‘80s and ‘90s with his early reporting on crack, by naming Teddy Riley’s sound ‘new jack swing,’ and writing star vehicles for Wesley Snipes (New Jack City,Sugar Hill) and Tupac (Above the Rim.) Though he lived much of the last decades of his life in Baltimore, he was Harlem to his core.”\nPeers like Nelson George as well as younger writers like Kevin Powell and Cheo Hodari Coker, the late Greg Tate—represent a wave that brought literary nuance to hip-hop culture. Barry Michael Cooper was a new jack writer.\n“It rang strong, new jack,” he said. “They were two words that weren’t supposed to go together—but they did. There was a whole thing about the play on words—and thepowerof words to me.”\n",

        "title": "Questlove Discusses Inspiration Behind New Sly Stone Documentary",
        "description": "Questlovehas offered plenty of insight into what inspired hisupcoming documentary about Sly Stone, the bandleader of the influential Sly and the Family Stone.\nIn a digital cover story forVIBE, The Roots drummer went long about how the project, titledSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genius), came to be and explained how it’s just as much about Sly as it is about other artists, specifically Black ones.\n“Before I started the film, I just started with small focus groups. I went to my moms like, ‘Alright, what do you think happened to Sly Stone?’ ‘Oh, man, he was such a genius. Then he started hanging with the wrong crowd and doing drugs,’” Quest said.\n“What I wanted to know is, and this is what’s addressed in the film, what’s happening in your life that makes drugs (the outlet)? Because the thing is, Black people have not been taught to have emotions,” he said.\n“Because we have zero touch with our emotions, we know that happiness feels good, and then when something dark happens, we don’t know what to do, right? What gets me happy? This drink, this tattoo, this sexual release, (you’re a) shopaholic…we have so many vices that we go to. But it was important for me to kill the notion of just the drug addict to be the drug addict,” he added. “Just doing drugs to be doing the drugs? Why? What does (the artist) feel inside? These are questions we don’t ask ourselves.”\nElsewhere in the story, Joseph Patel, a producer forSLY LIVES!and Quest’s creative partner for his first documentary,Summer of Soul, also spoke about the inspiration behind the upcoming film — including its distinct title.\n“Ahmir had that idea; the subtitle of the film, ‘...the Burden of Black Genius.’ It’s the first thing he talked about when he talked about the Sly story,” Patel said. “He’s like, ‘Look, a lot of my peers have gone through this, and they self-sabotage.’ It’s because of this other thing that we don’t see, this invisible thing, invisible pressure that specifically Black artists — but really you can extrapolate it to all artists — go through. And that the public, especially in the age of social media, doesn’t really understand or appreciate or see.”\nSLY LIVES!premieres February 13 on Hulu, and will include appearances from a number of well-known names: D’Angelo, Chaka Khan, André 3000, George Clinton, Vernon Reid, Q Tip, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, dream hampton, and Mark Anthony Neal. It had its debutat this year’s Sundance Film Festival. The film serves as the follow-up to his brilliantSummer of Souldocumentary released in 2021. Along withSummerandSLY LIVES!, Questwill be directing a documentary on Earth, Wind & Fire.\nRead more of Quest’sVIBEstoryhere.",

For all that hate, I'm going to answer with love. Y'all can't hate enough on me. I love too much,\" explained the Death Row Records CEO. \"Get your life right stop worrying about mine.

        "title": "30 for 30: The 30 Best Joey Bada$$ Verses",
        "description": "Toward the very end of theblog era,New York was looking for its next \"rapper's rapper\" champion, andJoey Bada$$emerged as its fiercest — and youngest — contender. Blessed with rare verbal kinesthesia and the spirit of an old Wu-Tang Clan talisman, the then-17-year-old materialized as a nearly complete product, with1999crystallizing his status as a young micro icon. Today, he turns 30, and things have changed, but the quality of the bars have not.\nWhen he's not appearing in movies or TV shows, Joey shows off the skills that helped make him a young legend. A tidy constellation of nimble flows and twitchy rhyme schemes, albums likeB4.Da.$,All-Amerikkkan Bada$$, and2000being vessels for syntactic acrobatics and understated wordplay. With the ability to be as precise as he is unwieldy, Joey has remained one of the strongest technical spitters of his era. He doesn’t drop often, but he hits when he does. To celebrate his birthday, it’s time to take a look at which bars hit the hardest.\nToday, Okayplayer takes a look at Joey Bada$$’s 30 best verses. Check it out for yourself below.\n1. “Waves” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nAccompanied by Freddie Joachim’s luscious beat (seriously, arguably one of the best rap beats of the 2010s), Joey’s raps on “Waves” are essentially his proper introduction to the rap game — and it’s an electric one. Here, he flaunts breathless flows with languid ease as he paints a tale of relentless ambition. Fittingly, “Waves” was proof that Joey would soon be making his own. —Charles Elliott\n\n2. “Snakes” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n\nLike his  best1999stanzas, “Snakes” verse 1 is as agile as it is meditative, with Joey flipping through lucid thoughts with acrobatic finesse. The alliteration here only accentuates the casually profound nature of his observations: “These ain't fair races, they just let the fear erase us/Adopted by the slums, son of guns this is how they raised us.” -Peter A. Berry\n\n3. “Survival Tactics” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIf you like layered wordplay, “Survival Tactics” is probably one of your favorite Joey verses. This one’s an exercise in homonyms. “I'm a martian with an army of Spartans” sounds like “I'm marchin’ with an army of Spartans.” “Sparring with a knife in a missile fight” which could also be “Spawning with a knife in a missile fight.” It could be either an ancient Spartan dominating a fight with modern weapons, or a space battle with Spartans from the Halo universe, spawning into a multiplayer game with rocket launchers. Just extremely impressive stuff for anyone — let alone a 17-year-old.-Patrick Smith\n4. “Killuminati Pt 2” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nKendrick’s “Control” verse didn’t mention Joey, but that didn’t stop him from responding and refuting Kendrick’s claim to the title of “King of NY.” It’s a toss up, but we like Verse 1 the best. In it, Joey has more homonym fun as he shifts between double meanings while bouncing between different pockets of the beat. -Patrick Smith\n\n5. “Hardknock” (Verse 3)\n\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nFor this one, Joey uses dense imagism and tightly wound rhyme schemes to interlock childhood innocence with blockboy trauma. Shifting through memories, he tightropes faded optimism and the truths he’s learned from a cold world: “Kids don’t play, they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread/Children on the corners slingin' some regs, poppin' some meds.” -Peter A. Berry\n\n6. “#LongLiveSteelo” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nSaying goodbye to old friends never gets easier, especially when they’re dead. It’s a battle Joey’s fought often since the death of his friend Capital STEEZ, and he takes us to the frontline in “#LongLiveSteelo” verse 1. Here, he makes us feel the weight of the struggle with lucid reminiscences and questions he’ll never get answers to.—Peter A. Berry\n\n7. “‘95 Til Infinity” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n“‘95 Til Infinity” verse 1 is peak Joey. It’sgot a dense rhyme schemes, wordplay, metaphors and homonyms–it’s packed. He starts with a staccato acapella to icapture your attention. He brags about his rap prowess and comfortably finds the pocket as the beat returns, and even though the sound of the track is laidback, Joey’s lyrics are aggressive. This verse is one of the many reasons Joey gets compared to the boom bap titas of yesteryear. -Patrick Smith\n8. “Suspect” (Verse 10)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nFor his1999closing track, Joey uses the last verse to lean into his NY rap roots. On a song that quotes Nas, he starts his verse with an allusion to anotherIllmatic track (“Life’s A Bitch”) and matches an acrobatic flow to a beat that’s as stylish as it is preternaturally calm. He caps the affair with the strongest, most emblematic line on the whole track: “See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error, The Era.”- Patrick Smith\n9. “The Ruler's Back” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nSometimes subtlety is overrated, and in Joey’s second verse, he makes his message very clear: The West Coast is getting way too much shine right now. For a track that references both Jay-Z and Nas’ famous diss tracks, Joey brings the aggression and word play he’s known for. The energy in this verse, and the track as a whole, is encapsulated in the line “This that black Air Force energy comin' out your speaker.” If you’re going to send a clear shot to the rap game, you better be prepared to back it up. -Patrick Smith\n10. “King to a God” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nThe beat barely has enough time to build before Joey hits the track with his sprightly assault. He rapidly fires internal and end rhymes to overwhelm the listener before casually settling into the beat with shapeshifting rhyme patterns. Before his verse is done, he’s moved to more slant rhymes to continue boasting about his rap skills. This is Joey doing his best “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” He even says it himself, “I move indubitably and put these words together so beautifully.” -Patrick Smith\n\n11. “PE Cypher” (Verse 11)\n- YouTubeyoutu.be\nJoey’s homage to Biggie’s “Kick in the Door” is gritty and relentless. While Biggie glided over the beat, Joey almost growls, doubling down on the aggressive nature of his verse. His lyrics range from playful metaphors to straight up boasts, and while his rhyme scheme isn’t too complicated, his pace gives the verse all the energy it needs. At only 18, he confidently raps over a classic Biggie song, welcoming the comparisons and scrutiny at a time when New York’s boom-bap spirit was severely lacking. -Patrick Smith\n12. “Babylon” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nAs visceral as it is skillful, “Babylon” verse 1 is a thoughtful rumination on police brutality. While he can be mournful here, his fluttering intonations feel like a call to action. It’s technically precise, but his vocal performance is the most potent element — the kind of delivery that can only come from someone who’s genuinely exasperated (or just really good at rapping). -Peter A. Berry\n\n13. “America” (Verse 4)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nBefore truly putting the world on notice, a pre-1999Joey served up a standout guest verse on Mac Miller’sMacadelicmixtape. His diction is as crisp as his flow as smooth. His ability to pile intricate rhymes is clear from the jump. Only a phenom can generate these bars at the age of 17: “Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame/To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat/No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes” in a verse that announces your upcoming solo debut. He was literally still in high school writing rhymes like this. -Patrick Smith\n\n14. “Word is Bond” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nAs the first single fromSummer Knights,“Word is Bond” served as a reminder of Joey’s snappy wordplay, while signaling his ever-evolving lyricism and delivery. The verbal imagination is as impressive as his syntactical precision: “Tetrahedrons, take a dose of Patron / With knowledge juice and deuce Cubes of Metatron.” Related: “Hit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens” is as fire then as it is now -Charles Elliott\n15. “Paper Trail$” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIt’s really the second verse where “Paper Trail$” shines, with Joey rapping on the ills of money and flipping Wu-Tang Clan’s classic “C.R.E.A.M.” manifesto into a critique on being avaricious: “‘Cause cash ruined everythin’ around me.” It’s a necessary commentary, with Joey ultimately speaking to the damned if you, damned if you don’t relationship many of us are forced to have with money. -Charles Elliott\n\n16 .“Let it Breathe” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n“I came in this at 17 and gave the game a weddin' ring,” Joey declares toward the end of his first verse on “Let it Breathe.” The final lines he offers in that verse are a culmination of his rise and just how well of a rapper he’s grown into since then. As he states in those last rhymes before hitting the song’s break: “Go against the God, you could never win.”—Charles Elliott\n\n17. “Survivors Guilt” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIn a tribute to his cousin, Junior B, as well as the late Capital STEEZ, Joey offers some incredibly vulnerable raps dedicated to these people who are no longer with him. The first verse for Steez is particularly gutwrenching, with Joey sharing his guilt at not being able to help him, and even claiming that some people blamed him for STEEZ’s death. “Lyrically couldn't top him, he was the ni**a with the belt,” Joey declares of the late rapper. -Charles Elliott\n\n18. “Christ Conscious” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIf you didn’t know any better, you’d think “Christ Conscious” verse 1 was an audition for the Wu-Tang Clan. If it were, Joey would’ve easily made the cut. For this one, Joey leans heavy into the exaggerated theatrics as he piles syllables atop syllables and inventive boasts, channeling the spirit of the best ’90s rhyme-slingers before him. -Peter A. Berry\n\n19. “My Yout” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nAn ode to Joey’s Jamaican heritage, the beat is very light-hearted, but Joey is still packing his verses with lyrical density. In the second verse, he’s hitting on multiple levels, with multiple rhymes schemes, homonyms, slant rhymes and more. He’s in a flow state, like the star in a kung-fu movie, just surgically hitting your pressure points and then calmly walking away while you lay on the floor. -Patrick Smith\n\n20. “Amethyst Rockstar” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIt’s the energy and hunger in Joey’s delivery here that leaves an impression. It’s equal parts funny and enthralling, as if he’s channeling the animated eccentricity of a young Busta Rhymes when he rhymes, “Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes / Hit my main bitch in the Poconos.” -Charles Elliott\n21. “Wendy n Becky” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nThis is a great example of Joey’s dexterity. He’s able to change his cadence and rhyme structure mid verse. He starts to use internal rhymes in his bars and slows his cadence to mimic a conversation, all while using his trademark homonyms. And while it’s not a verse that you’ll think of as an all-time rap classic, you risk underestimating it because Joey makes it look so easy. -Patrick Smith\n22. “Distance” (Verse 1)\n\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nSome of the most innovative and fundamentally sharp wordsmiths can have trouble letting loose, especially when they’re featured on a song that is meant to be more playful than lyrically dense. But Joey finds his pocket on the song, embedding quippy bars with melody and flyguy grace. It all feels like he’s taking you on a joyride, even if he’s not flaunting his typically elaborate rap pyrotechnics. Joey’s known for doing a lot with a lot, but for this one, he proves he can do a lot with a little, too. -Patrick Smith\n\n23. “Unorthodox” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nWith its double-stitched rhyme schemes and some succinct reflection, Joey evokes classic rap traditions with a verse that defies the song title. It’s all as raw as it is skillful — a perfect microcosm of apex boom bap.—Peter A. Berry\n24. “Zipcodes” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nJoey taps into his celebratory fly guy mode as he dives in and out of pockets with the controlled ease of a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander crossover. The quotables abound here, but what impresses more than any couple bars is the precision that ties them together.—Peter A. Berry\n25.  “Legendary” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIt’s hard to match J. Cole on wax, but Joey did exactly that on “Legendary,” where he uses vivid couplets to paint a mosaic of hope, aspiration, and desolation. It’s all succinct and thoughtful, but again, it’s threaded by Joey’s rarefied agility, evidence of a skillset that’s legendary.—Peter A. Berry\n\n26. “Gotham Fucking City” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nCombining casual rhyme schemes with a comic book artist’s imagination and a beat that sounds exactly like the song title, this one embodies perfectly classic Joey; succinct, athletic and verbose in the best way possible.—Peter A. Berry\n\n27. “Head High” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nJoey goes full story mode in the second verse on “Head High,” recalling how he first met XXXTENTACION and developed a close bond with him. It’s as raw and personal as we’ve ever seen Joey, who keeps his personal life closely tucked. You can hear the pain as he reminisces about losing X, and how he’d reminded him of Capital Steez. Joey originally released the first verse as a loose track after the passing of Juice WRLD and Pop Smoke, and eventually finished the song on his album2000. -Patrick Smith\n\n28. “Sup Preme” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n“Sup Preme” verse 2 proves both Joey’s writing skills and penchant for theatrics. Here, he alters his tempo to play with the beat. It’s not one of his more complicated verses, it’s mostly about how he doesn’t need to work, he can just roll up and spit some bars to make money. And yet, his piercing diction and energetic flow provide an engrossing contrast to the mellow soundscape — evidence of his prodigious control behind the mic.- Patrick Smith\n\n29. “Daemons” (Verse 2)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nFor this posthumous XXXTENTACION track, Joey delivers a verse that’s brooding, dark and guarded. It’s a rare, truly introspective verse from Joey, so it’s all even more striking than usual. It’s an exercise in bleakness — this track is meant to exorcise his demons, not make us feel any better. “I see demons, and there's nothin' they don't know about me/No matter how much I try to hide, they gon' find me,” he spits, with his dreary intonations underscoring that inevitability. -Patrick Smith\n\n30. “Land of the Free” (Verse 1)\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nJoey has never been afraid to address politics and analyze current events in his rhymes, and his albumALL-AMERICAN BADA$$is proof. For this one, he directs a heaping dose of distrust against America. The second single of his sophomore album, Joey didn’t hold back, calling for mass political consciousness in the wake of Barack Obama leaving office and Donald Trump becoming president. While Joey doesn’t get too elaborate here, he makes sure to speak from his heart and let his audience know exactly where he stands on an important political issue. In an age of indifference, Joey reminded us to feel.- Patrick Smith",

In total, there will be six shows, with each of those days having an 8 and 10:30pm show time.\nDo You Want More?!!!??!is The Roots’ second album, but their first on a major label, DGC Records.\nDuring a past Red Bull Music Academy conversation, Questlove shared how he almost managed to keepDo You Want More?!!!??!— and being in The Roots — a secret from his father, who didn’t initially support the drummer’s foray into hip-hop.\n“The thing that people don’t believe is that I managed to keep The Roots a secret from my father to the beginning of our second album,” he said. “My father did not know aboutOrganix, and I was halfway done through our second album,Do You Want More?!!!??!, before I had to tell him, ‘I kinda have a record deal.’”\n“He didn’t see it [hip-hop] as an art form. You know, I’d blast Public Enemy’sNation of Millions, and he’d just like, ‘Ahhh, there’s no music, that’s not art, it’s not music.’ So we just never bonded on that level, so I’ll say that in terms of hip-hop, it was a harder sell for my father,” he added. “And even deep into our second album, it was still, ‘You gotta get a real job one day. You gotta get a real job one day.’ I think he just put his fears of his stalled career, he projected that onto me. But, you know, he’s not saying that now.

        "description": "As a BetterHelp affiliate, we receive compensation from BetterHelp if you purchase products or services through the links provided.\nFor Cori “CHOCC” Broadus, a lupus diagnosis came pre-packaged with a feeling of lifetime personal damnation.\n“I used to tell my dad, ‘I feel like I’m the cursed child,’” says CHOCC, an alt-pop artist who happens to be the daughter of thelegendary Snoop Dogg. “And he was like, ‘No, you're not. If anything, you have a story and people love you and people want to be around you.’”\nThese days, that story has galvanized fans into embracing the same self-love techniques and emotional transparency that’s enabled Chocc to surmount medical travails while leveling up her music career. When she’s not promoting her newJournals to Johnnyproject, she’s responding to DMs from fans also dealing with the condition. Some even say she saved their life.\nSee on Instagram\n\n“I think that's really my ultimate goal: Making the next person want to live, and seeing all the things that I go through and knowing that they can get through it as well,” she says.\nGetting through i isn’t easy. Most of the time, it begins with you. That’s how it’s been for CHOCC. Speaking withOkayplayer for The Pursuit of Happiness, CHOCC explains how she perseveres through lupus while maintaining her mental health at all times.\nCHOCC:They say pain is beauty. I think that that's true. I always sit here asking, “Why did you do this to me, God? Why is this happening?” But I feel like he gives things to people he knows can handle them. And maybe he’s making me go through all this so I can help the next person, which I'm already doing. There's so many people that send me DMs about how I save their life. and I'm like, “Well, shit, I barely want to live, so how am I making you want to live?” It’s beautiful because I'm so open and I'm not afraid to tell the real and the raw.\nI have my days where I'm in bed, sad and dwelling on everything that I've been through. Dealing with it comes down to writing down the pros and the cons. I'm very blessed. I have the best doctors. I'm straight. I’m more than straight. I got to the point where I'm like, “Okay, Cori, this is your life. It could be worse.” I could be bedridden, I could be on kidney dialysis.” I think about all that stuff and how I'm able to get up every single day and do what I need to do, even if it may take longer. But I'm able to get up and do what I need to do.\nLife is short and anything can happen. Take care of yourself and be there for yourself. I'm a people pleaser. I constantly want to be there and give to the next person. And if you can't even give to yourself, how are you supposed to be great for the next person? So I think that's what I'm on right now. It’s part of my self-discovery journey — figuring out what Cori likes, what makes Cori happy, and just making sure that I'm never put in that situation again when it comes to having another stroke. It gets hard sometimes because I do inject myself twice a day on blood thinners. I go crazy sometimes because it's twice a day I have to poke myself. It hurts every single time. But if this is what you got to do, girl, that's what you got to do.\nMy family's amazing. I didn't realize how strong my village was until after my stroke. It got to a point where I was like, “Okay, I just need one day where no one comes to the hospital, no one gives me flowers. I just need time to myself.” And even when I would walk just in the hallway, I would see other patients in the room just by themself. No one came to visit them. I’m blessed.\nI try to look at the bigger picture of everything. I have to appreciate that every day I wake up and I'm able to see another day and experience life. It's very hard, but I always tell myself there’s nothing I can't overcome. There’s nothing that God has given me that I can't deal with. Me having lupus since I was six years old, having a stroke, me going through guy problems, me going through friend problems and just life itself. There’s certain situations that I can look back at and laugh at, and I was tripping over that and I was doing this and I was doing that. It’s just knowing that it takes time. When I speak, I realize how I'm nowhere near alone. There’s a lot of people that are going through what I'm going through. They ask me, “Cori, how do you deal with lupus? Are you okay?” I don't necessarily think I'm ever okay. I’m just going with it. Healing is a process. I feel like you never stop healing.",

        "description": "After a woman who claimedJay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs sexually assaulted herwhen she was 13, Jay-Z’s lawyer has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit,Varietyreports.\nJay-Z got permission earlier this week from United States District Judge Analisa Torres to file the motion. His attorney Alex Spiro has cited the accuser’s televised interview with NBC News in December, in which she acknowledged “mistakes” when retelling her story, as evidence of “major inconsistencies” in her account. Spiro claims that there are numerous “outright impossibilities” in the accuser’s allegations. Her attorney, Tony Buzbee, is already facing a defamation suit from Jay and his legal team.\nJudge Torres ruled that Carter’s accuser can remain anonymous. She also condemned his lawyer’s “relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks [on accuser’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee].” Spiro argued that the Jane Doe’s lawyer Tony Buzbee is accusing Carter of “a horrific crime without adequately vetting the allegation.”\nNow, the rapper’s team is requesting a monetary sanction or fee award against Buzbee and his law firm; they accuse Buzbee of “alleging facts without a sufficient investigation or by failing to withdraw those allegations once it is clear that they are false or exceedingly unlikely to be true.”\nBuzbee has fired back.\nIn a statement shared withVariety, Buzbee stated the following:\n“Mr. Spiro and his firm are paid by the hour. So, they file a lot of junk with the Court. With each frantic filing, his team reeks of desperation. He and his team think the laws and rules don’t apply to them. They are flat wrong. They also think they can bully or intimidate counsel for victims by filing meritless and frivolous pleadings full of lies and half-truths. They are dead wrong. We won’t be bullied or intimidated, ever.”",

        "description": "And just like that, anotherGolden Globe Awardshas passed us by. As one of the few awards shows still worth caring about, we decided to tap in this year and, despite Abbott Elementary getting snubbed, there were still a lot of dope moments.\nCheck out our top 5 below.\n5. Zendaya Showing Off Her Engagement Ring\nBefore or around the same time news broke that she’d just gotten engaged to Tom Holland,Zendaya, looking fabulous as always, showed off her engagement ring. It was a moment of joy and pristine style meshed with some absolutely perfect timing. Unfortunately, though, she didn’t take home any trophies for the clearly under-appreciatedChallengers. Watch her flaunt her new ring for yourself below.\n\n4. Colin Farrell Wins Golden Globe for The Penguin\nAnyone who watchedThe Penguinknew they were taking in some dope shit, with the primary conduit being the one and only Colin Farrell. With a mix of twitchy facial expressions, the engrossing charisma of an actual mob boss, and a little help from the show’s makeup team, Farrell helped makeThe Penguinone of the best new TV series of the whole year, and he won an award for it yesterday.\nLast night, his turn asThe Penguin’s titular character won him the Golden Globe for Best Acting in a Limited Series. “I guess it’s prosthetics from here on out,” he told the crowd before giving props to the makeup team and everyone else on the cast.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n\n3. Zoe Saldaña Wins First Golden Globe\nBelieve it or not, Zoe Saldaña had never won a Golden Globe award before last night. At the awards show, she took home the trophy for Wins Best Supporting Female Actor (forEmilia Pérez). Her teary eyed acceptance speech was just as powerful as her turn as lawyer Rita Mora Castro.\n\"I'm filled with adrenaline, but my heart is full of gratitude,\" she told the audience. \"I love you — you guys are everything.\"Watch her whole speech below:\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n\n2.Viola Davis’ Cecil Demille Award Acceptance Speech\nPro tip: listen to a Viola Davis acceptance speech any time you can. Through the years, she’s managed to deliver some of the most poignant and emotionally transparent moments through her acceptance speeches, and this one was no different. After receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was presented by the great Meryl Streep, Davis turned in yet another lucid reflection on her career journey.\n\"Little Viola is squealing,\" Davis said in the closing of her speech. \"She's standing behind me now and she's pulling on my dress. And she's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they made her feel 'purty' ... And what she's whispering is, 'I told you I was a magician.'\"\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\n\nFor this one, Nikki Glaser took a break from roasting people to serve up some jokes that ranged from visceral humor to more incisive social commentary. There were nods to Hollywood’s predatory nature, but there was also an amazing collaboration joke with Adam Sandler. There were countless celebrity name-drops. There was just a lot, and Nikki threaded it all with preternatural ease and impeccable timing.\n- YouTubeyoutu.be\n",

The video removing the track has since been removed from Williams’ YouTube account.\nNow, Drake doesn’t mention any names here, but, besides the context here — you know, the whole friends celebrating and absorbing “gimmicks” from someone — there is at least one other clue. The song is called “Fighting Irish,” which could be a nod to LeBron’s alma mater St. Vincent-St. Mary High School.\nIn any case, stay locked in for when the track officially drops.

        "description": "It’s hard to imagine “So Fresh, So Clean” withoutAndré 3000— but it turns out that was almost the case.\nIn a recent interview withSpin, Sleepy Brown shared that the OutKast rapper didn't initially want to be on one of the duo’s most beloved and biggest songs.\n“The funny thing is André didn’t really like it at first. André didn’t like that record. It wasn’t like he didn’t think it was good — it just wasn’t matching where he was,” Brown recalled. “We really just did it for Big. We knew André was moving to something else, but we knew on that album it needed that hood theme. When Big heard it, he loved it. We thought 'Dre was going to be happy with it at first, but he really wasn’t.”\nBrown, a frequent collaborator of OutKast’s, then revealed what led to 3 Stacks joining the track: Preston Crump,an Atlanta bassistwho has done work for Goodie Mob, TLC, Destiny’s Child, and, of course, OutKast.\n“['Dre] was cool, but he didn’t really like it until Preston, our bass player, played a cold line on that song,\" Brown said. “When Dre heard that, he got excited and came up with ‘the coolest motherfunkers on the planet’ part. He was following that line he heard. Thanks to Preston, that’s the reason why Dre even got on that record.”\nReleased as part of the duo’s fourth album, 2000’sStankonia, “So Fresh, So Clean” went on to be certified platinum in 2020 and certified double platinum last yearby the Recording Industry Association of America.\nIn related news, André was recently askedabout the prospects of new OutKast musicand his mindset toward it now.\n“I’ll say maybe 10, 15 years ago, in my mind, I thought an OutKast album would happen,”the New Blue Sun artistsaid in aninterview with Rolling Stonelast month. “I don’t know the future, but I can say that we’re further away from it than we’ve ever been. I think it’s a chemistry thing. We have to be wanting to do it. It’s hard for me to make a rap, period, you know? And sometimes I’m in the belief of, “Let things be.”\n“It was a great time in life, and our chemistry was at a certain place that was undeniable. And I think the audience sometimes believes that something has to last forever, and I don’t think that,” he continued. “Any kind of art form, I think that’s probably the opposite. It probably should not last forever. It’s not like a product. In the end, we did give a product, but what made that product was a certain time in both of our lives.”",

His tracks — at once muted and kinetic — mirror the soul of a creator who finds escape in sunshine and samples.\n“One thing I know that never fails is when I go home and I can just be back in the element that I used to be in — just nature,” says Ovrkast., who released hisWhile The Iron Is Hotproject last month. “I just love being outside.”\nWhen he’s not in the great outdoors, he’s getting lost in drum loops — or open-ended phone calls with his best friends. It’s part of a heal as you go mental health maintenance program he’s developed through years in the industry. As a musician and a human being.\nSpeaking with Okayplayer, Ovrkast. breaks down the ways he keeps up his mental hygiene. Tap in to see what he’s got to say below, in an as-told-to lightly edited for length and clarity.\nOvrkast.:Mentally, I’m pretty good. I've done pretty well. I've gotten over the hill. I've gotten over the hill of self-doubt. I think now my new stresses are just the managing of things. There's too many things going on right now. But back in the day, I had the doubt of having nothing going on where it's like, ‘I guess I can't do it. It's not going to work, blah, blah. But now it's like, “f—, I got too much to do.’ It is a new type of stress that I'm learning how to deal with. It’s good stress, but it's like I'm figuring out ways to not have it impact people in my life in negative ways. That's the biggest one. Trying to figure out how to balance it to the point where it doesn't spill over.I get away from online negativity by going back home. I moved to New York a year ago, and it's always really busy, so it's hard to find quiet. There are quiet places, back home in the Bay Area, it was really easy for me to go and drive somewhere really quickly. Just get away. It’s one thing I know that never fails when I go home. I can just be back in the element that I used to be in or just in general. Just nature. I love being outside. Sometimes I’ll turn my phone off or put a playlist on and just walk around. I’ll just be there and look at the scenery. But there's things I do on the internet that are also peaceful. I'll make movie boards and I'll write lyrics. Or I'll watch old movies. Criterion Collection has a bunch of good shit. I love watching old films. I'll put some incense, watch an old film in my crib, or I'll pull the SP out and I'll just start making beats. It’s just stuff to just get my brain moving and feeling good. It’s almost ritualistic; cutting on the incense, opening the window, letting the air out. And then to me it's like a challenge. The SP and YouTube and my drum packs. I'm hunting to find a good sound to use. I'm flipping through tons of samples and I'm flipping through a bunch of things to see what I can find and see what I can flip. If I can get a good loop, it's a good way to just get away and feel like I'm 16 again.For me, being a more positive thinker comes down to humor. A lot of ridiculous things happen in our lives and I call my homies and we just laugh at it. Sometimes life is like a sitcom. It's unreal how crazy sh— happens or how people act, and it's like, ‘What the f—?’ It’s about not taking myself too seriously. It's not that deep all the time. It’s about stepping out from that pessimistic [idea] ‘no one understands.’ Not everybody is going to understand that's what it is. Find people who do understand.\nOvrkast.:Mentally, I’m pretty good.

        "title": "\"From the Basement to the Culture: How ‘Rap City’ Became Hip-Hop’s Eternal Pulse\"",
        "description": "Rap Citywas proof.\nBy the time the show made its BET debut on Aug. 11, 1989, hip-hop was the rallying cry of Black America, reduced to a catchy whisper throughout mainstream America. The Grammys wouldn’t air our awards. Radio rarely played our music. MTV birthedYo! MTV Rapsin 1988, years after music titans likeRick James and David Bowiequestioned the network’s apparent erasure of Black artists.\nTo many, hip-hop was a fad.Rap Citywas proof that hip-hop was more.\n“Even though MTV was doing it [withYo! MTV Raps], this was from Black people to Black people. It was like B2B,” FormerVibe Magazineeditor-in-chief,Datwon Thomas, joked in an interview withOkayplayer. “If you weren’t a rapper, you weren’t going to be onYo! MTV Raps. ForRap City, if you were an up-and-coming DJ, you could get on and be inThe Basementwith Tigger. It felt like you could make it.”That’sRap City’s eternal legacy — music discovery anywhere as proof that hip-hop was everywhere. BeforeT.I. became the “King of the South,”he was an unknown entourage member rolling with Goodie Mob, OutKast and Youngbloodz whenRap Cityhosts Joe Clair and Leslie “Big Lez” Segar gave him time to shine on camera. In BET’s documentaryWelcome To Rap City, T.I. left the drug game after that singular experience because he felt he was close to changing his life. Jay-Z was $1 billion poorer and a year removed from escaping afederal drug raidthat would’ve landed him in prison when Prime let him rhyme for the first time on TV in 1990 next to Big Daddy Kane. Thomas, who remembers first hearing Common in 1992 onRap City, saw how the show became a pipeline between rappers and the mainstream attention of BET’s national audience. “Rap Citywas part of our daily lexicon. When we were atVibe, we’d want to turn on the TV to see what they got going on.”Authenticity is what made you trustRap City’s musical judgment. The people guiding you through the world of hip-hop were children of the culture and felt like reflections of the audience that trusted them. In its prime,Rap Cityhosts included comedians respected by rappers (Chris “The Mayor” Thomas and Joe Clair), a reformed drug dealer (Durik “Prince” Dajour), hip-hop nerd (Hans “Prime” Dobson), and a hip-hop choreographer (Leslie “Big Lez” Segar).Rap Citystarted as the premiere destination for music discovery, but quickly became an institution hip-hop swore by as we watched those unknowns ascend to superstardom afterRap Citygave them a launchpad.“Rap Citywas a religion. The hosts were the disciples,” former Def Jam President Kevin Liles said inWelcome To Rap City.IfRap Citywas a religion, then you can easily divide its timeline with B.T. and A.T. — Before Tigger and After Tigger. For generations of hip-hop fans, the mere mention ofRap Cityreflexively makes them think of the beady-eyed jovial smile of Darian “Big Tigger” Morgan, a radio personality with a boombox for vocal chords and ginsu knife for a tongue willing to slice through any awkward tension with a piercing joke or cut any MCs head off with a devastating freestyle. He was the perfect person to usherRap Cityinto its new, and most definitive era —Rap City: The Basement.“The very firstRap City:The Basementshow we did was with Redman and Method Man. I already had a history with them from my radio station, WPGC, at the time because when ‘How High’ came out, they had come to the radio station, and we had freestyled on the radio for 20 minutes, which was unheard of back then,”Big Tiggersaid in an interview withOkayplayer. “By the second week, it was a thing. To have an opportunity to just go in there and have fun with some of my favorite artists was the best part of my whole show.”Rap Cityevolved from appointment television to a sort of destination TV when it moved toThe Basementon Sept. 13, 1999. It was a simple, makeshift basement set tattooed with all the records you want to listen to and the posters of all of the rappers you’d ever want to meet, fitted with a recording booth. The rappers that were beginning to reach rarified air, buoyed by multi-platinum success, all descended from their unreachable perch into a place we all felt was home because it most likely looked like our homes. And then there was The Booth.Common and Will.I.Am during Common and Will.I.Am Visit BET's Rap City - January 9, 2007 at BET Studios in New York City, New York, United States.Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage.It cannot be overstated how impactful The Booth was to hip-hop. It wasn’t a programming formality; it was a rite of passage, a proving ground, whether you had the No. 1 song in the country or the hottest mixtape on the block. Before106 & Parkbecame a national phenomenon in 2001, there was a two-year window where the best platform for rappers to directly appeal to their audience on a massively popular network was in Mama Tigger’s basement. Pair that with the fact the show’s heyday came at the tail end of hip-hop’s golden era, where the legends of today were still etching their place in history, and you can understand why The Booth was treated with career-shifting reverence.Clips during Clipse, Swizz Beatz and Vixon Model on Rap City - November 28, 2006 at BET Studio in New York City, New York, United States.Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage.For a few minutes every day, the shiny suit glitz, the platinum plaque shine, and the Cristal lifestyle were gone, and fans were greeted with a mixtape of All Stars, the magnitude of which has never been duplicated since. You had 2001 Jadakissboasting abouthis“nicks the size of PlayStation memory cards”over Sunshine Anderson’s “Heard It All Before.”2003 DMXwas“starting to get too big for the cage I’ve been trapped in” over Nas’s “Made You Look.” Cam’ron counted a stack of cash while explaining how his“A.K. was his AKA before his ABCs”in what is now referred to as a “cultural moment” by Thomas. Tigger remembers, “Ludacris wrote rhymes just for the show.” Buju Banton and Elephant Man turned thebasement into a bashmentin aRap Cityfreestyle so iconic it’s still talked about in Jamaica and is the first thing you see when you Google “Buju Banton Elephant Man.”The Booth was the land of nearly inexplicable level-ups, where even lyrical Krillins like Lil Bow Wow could become Super Saiyans. By shifting the focus of The Notorious B.I.G.’s rap and R&B diva-focused “Just Playing (Dreams)” primarily to Hollywood actresses he wanted to date, the lyrically underwhelming spitter improbably delivered a top fiveRap Cityfreestyle of all time. Somehow, the teen heartthrob turned into a sly wordsmith, conjuring quippy barbs like,“J. Lo, I don’t know, I don’t wanna go where everybody been/Ben (Affleck).”Even Tigger, with his penchant for punishing freestyles, made sure every MC was inspired to bring their best, if for nothing else than to not be upstaged by the host. “There were some people who got a bit more energy from me because I ain’t believe ‘em. I heard you nice. Let me see if you’re really nice.”Lloyd Banks during Ludacris and Lloyd Banks Visit Rap City with Ludacris and Lloyd Banks at BET Studio in New York City, New York, United States.Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage.By the time the show went off air on Nov. 8, 2008, The Booth freestyles had become the most important part of the show. And as time has passed, it’s those moments of lyrical spontaneity that have keptRap Cityin the minds of future generations. “Without YouTube and Instagram, I might be forgotten. The network hasn’t done anything to keep the legacy alive by promoting it. Thank God people who watched it in real-time still have a thirst and reverence for it,” Tigger explains.One of the people inspired by those YouTube videos was 11-year-oldGabe Pabonin 2007, who formed “a subconscious thought of, ‘This would be something cool to do one day,’” he tellsOkayplayer. That Gen ZRap Cityappreciator grew up to become Gabe P, creator ofOn The Radar Radio, the premier hip-hop performance platform on the internet. The show’s green background and centerstage mic is the most recognizable freestyle setup sinceRap City’s booth. “It wasn’t until we did the first couple of freestyles where we all gathered around and thought, ‘Yo, this could be the nextRap City.’”On The Radar Radiois founded on the same principles of music discovery that definedRap City. The powerhouse platform releases five to seven freestyle videos a day, and is one of the few places where you can see a freestyle from little-known battle rapper Cortez and the next day see Drake and Central Cee break the internet. TheRap Citymodel of the late ‘90s and 2000s is still relevant to Gen Z because music discovery is an immutable aspect of life. With hundreds of thousands of songs released every day, platforms likeOn The Radar Radio,From The Block,The Front Porch, and others become trusted sources on what’s hot.“They don't haveRap Cityanymore on TV where they know at 4 p.m. they’ll turn on their TV to BET to watch [Rap City] and get their music taste. Now it’s on-demand for them at all times,” Gabe says. “We’re really good at creating a space for people to get lost in the OTR algorithm and just consume as much music as they like and discover as many artists as they want.”Marley Marl, KRS1 and 50 Cent during 50 Cent Host with Rap City with Special Guest KRS1 and Marley Marl at BET Rap City in New York, New York.Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage.Even with people like Gabe asserting “nothing I do would be possible without the Big Tiggers of the world,” Tigger’s voice is calm yet coated in disappointment when discussing the legacy ofRap City.Its spiritual offspring have had immense success, BET has aired multipleRap Cityspecials around the BET Hip Hop Awards between 2021-2023, and a three-partWelcome To Rap Citydocumentary traced the 19-year history of the hip-hop institution. Yet, Tigger talks about the show’s potential revival apparently never reaching an ideation meeting with BET, even though he attests that people ask him about bringing backRap Cityevery day. Still, he is thankful thatRap Citywas able to be proof that hip-hop is king.“Rap City was a show that brought hip-hop to every corner of the world,” Tigger says. “The lasting legacy is that the show expanded the importance of lyricism. I’m proud of a lot of things I’ve done in life. I’m no more prouder than the work that me, the producers, and the network did with that show.”\n“Even though MTV was doing it [withYo!

        "title": "Errol Eats Everything on Public Enemy, Entrepreneurship and Art Without Compromise",
        "description": "This is sponsored content, brought to you by Errol Eats Everything.\nErrol Eats Everythingis focused on his message, his music and his integrity. The Canadian emcee is relishing his creative freedom and using it to craft a musical voice unlike any other. His blistering self-titled debut is forged in the ethos of KRS-One,dead prezandPublic Enemy. With lyrics steeped in the ideologies of golden age hip-hop, Errol is focused on fighting the power. His background is an amalgamation of Toronto, NYC and Jamaica – and his vision refuses constraints. He’s doing thishisway — and that’s in a way that speaks to the concerns of 2025 without giving way to the industry’s contemporary indulgence.\nErrol Eats Everything: Why kick offErrol Eats Everythingwith an intro called “Inauguration?”\nAlbum cover for 'Errol Eats Everything.'Why was it important to put sociopolitical themes front and center?I call it the …Nation of Millions…for 2025. I feel like it’s [what’s] missing. Everybody is too busy selling themselves. Something pops and everybody emulates what pops. It always bothered me. If you go back historically in hip-hop, typically a label just emulates what’s successful. And then carbon copies of those particular things that are successful just keep on coming out.If you look at P.E., for instance, or X-Clan, nothing came out after that. [The industry] kind of abandoned that because I feel like the message is not what they wanted to perpetuate. [It] didn’t sell like ‘sex, drugs and rock and roll.’ I just felt like that was what was needed. That's what was in my soul. When I went down the path of knowledge of self and whatnot, you have a responsibility to adhere to what you’ve learned. And I felt like it was my responsibility to perpetuate what they need. People don’t know what they need; you have to give them what they need and when they discover it they’re like ‘oh!’It was important to me on a personal level. It was personal to me on a hip-hop level. And it was important to me on an originality level.And the sound is really stripped and soulful.The sound is really orchestrated by Furious Evans. He did the whole soundscape for everything. We talk about it all the time: it’s kind of following the James Brown mantra of ‘thegroove, baby.’ Because I feel like songs are overproduced and everybody wants to show how great their breakdowns are. We’re really groove-oriented. I think that there is a futuristic, throwback element to it. So if you’re a real head, you’ll catch various aspects of what you came up on. And there’s also an element where it will be nostalgic for an old head, somewhat, but an element that catches the new generation. Just [being] well-rounded; I didn’t put much thought into the sound, I just poured my soul into it and that’s what came out.It was more about the message for me. I make music that appeals to me – what I wanted to hear. Everybody says, ‘What’s your solution?’Thatwas my solution. I said ‘OK, fine, I’m gonna make whatIwanna hear.’ That was my approach.Photo by Sean Getti.What brought about your creative freedom?I’m in a space where, in the truest sense of the word, I'm an entrepreneur. I have a few successful businesses. When I was just an artist, I felt like my livelihood took away from my art. And I think a lot of artists go through that.One day, I just realized that I was in the position I’d always wanted to be in; [where] I don’t have things holding me back in the middle of the day. I can just pour my love into my art. And so I feel like I'm not compromised in any way. There is no agenda to my music beyond what you’re hearing. I don’t have to say ‘I’m trying to get on with a label.’ I’m in a position where I don’t have to compromise myself. And therefore, I’m putting out exactly what I wanted to hear and it echoes the sentiment of the master teachers. I think that my success as an entrepreneur led to me being brave and following my gut and my heart without compromise.So is that the spirit driving the project – one that says don’t compromise?In the past, Ihavecompromised. I was associated with labels and artists where they were more street and I was kind of emulating that. But that’s notme. So I felt like I compromised myself and my art early on — but I don’t feel like I’m compromising right now. I feel like this is what I'm supposed to do. At this point, I don’t feel like I’ve had to compromise in any capacity. I feel as free as I have ever felt as an artist._____Follow Errol Eats Everythinghere.\nAlbum cover for 'Errol Eats Everything.'\nWhy was it important to put sociopolitical themes front and center?\nI call it the …Nation of Millions…for 2025. I feel like it’s [what’s] missing. Everybody is too busy selling themselves. Something pops and everybody emulates what pops. It always bothered me. If you go back historically in hip-hop, typically a label just emulates what’s successful. And then carbon copies of those particular things that are successful just keep on coming out.\nIf you look at P.E., for instance, or X-Clan, nothing came out after that. [The industry] kind of abandoned that because I feel like the message is not what they wanted to perpetuate. [It] didn’t sell like ‘sex, drugs and rock and roll.’ I just felt like that was what was needed. That's what was in my soul. When I went down the path of knowledge of self and whatnot, you have a responsibility to adhere to what you’ve learned. And I felt like it was my responsibility to perpetuate what they need. People don’t know what they need; you have to give them what they need and when they discover it they’re like ‘oh!’\nIt was important to me on a personal level. It was personal to me on a hip-hop level. And it was important to me on an originality level.\nAnd the sound is really stripped and soulful.\nThe sound is really orchestrated by Furious Evans. He did the whole soundscape for everything. We talk about it all the time: it’s kind of following the James Brown mantra of ‘thegroove, baby.’ Because I feel like songs are overproduced and everybody wants to show how great their breakdowns are. We’re really groove-oriented. I think that there is a futuristic, throwback element to it. So if you’re a real head, you’ll catch various aspects of what you came up on. And there’s also an element where it will be nostalgic for an old head, somewhat, but an element that catches the new generation. Just [being] well-rounded; I didn’t put much thought into the sound, I just poured my soul into it and that’s what came out.\nPhoto by Sean Getti.\nWhat brought about your creative freedom?\nI’m in a space where, in the truest sense of the word, I'm an entrepreneur. I have a few successful businesses. When I was just an artist, I felt like my livelihood took away from my art. And I think a lot of artists go through that.\nOne day, I just realized that I was in the position I’d always wanted to be in; [where] I don’t have things holding me back in the middle of the day. I can just pour my love into my art. And so I feel like I'm not compromised in any way. There is no agenda to my music beyond what you’re hearing. I don’t have to say ‘I’m trying to get on with a label.’ I’m in a position where I don’t have to compromise myself. And therefore, I’m putting out exactly what I wanted to hear and it echoes the sentiment of the master teachers. I think that my success as an entrepreneur led to me being brave and following my gut and my heart without compromise.\n\nSo is that the spirit driving the project – one that says don’t compromise?\nIn the past, Ihavecompromised. I was associated with labels and artists where they were more street and I was kind of emulating that. But that’s notme. So I felt like I compromised myself and my art early on — but I don’t feel like I’m compromising right now. I feel like this is what I'm supposed to do. At this point, I don’t feel like I’ve had to compromise in any capacity. I feel as free as I have ever felt as an artist.\n_____\nFollow Errol Eats Everythinghere.",

Ina new interview withBillboard, Martinez explains why authenticity was an important element for her approach to the podcast.\nFor Martinez, it was about being able to have real conversations. She shared that part of why her 2023 interview withLauren Londonwas significant was because it was honest.“I just wanted to have more meaningful conversations on that level,” she adds. “So that’s why Lauren London was my first guest. She set the tone of the type of conversations I wanted to have, and people really resonated with it. I just did it from a place of purpose.“Any conversation I have, whether on the podcast or radio or in my real life, I’m always searching for authenticity. That’s the core of who I am, so that’s gonna be with me no matter where my conversation is, but the difference is radio is more about what’s happening today. What is current? What is trending? What is the news story of the day? It’s very current, and I love that!”Martinez is now teaming withThe Volumeto elevateIRLand take the podcast to the next level.“But the conversations on the podcast are specifically designed to be tools for people in their real life,” she explains. “So yes, somebody happens to be really famous or talented, but these are the things real life has taught them.

The RulerSlick Rickreturns with an ambitious visual album — his first official album in more than 25 years. Fellow vetDaz Dillingeris also back with a slice of Cali G funk for your road trips.\nDelayed from its initially expected May release,Young Thugis set to dropUY Scuti, his first album since getting out of jail last fall. It’s now supposed to drop in June but a firm date has yet to be announced. AndSamara Cynis back with her new EP,Backroads.Here are some of the albums we are looking forward to this month.YOUNG THUG - ‘UY SCUTI’ (TBD)If “Money on Money” is any indication, Young Thug’s forthcoming album,Uy Scuti, will be an absolute problem. He’s been recording the LP since getting out of prison.LIL WAYNE – ‘THA CARTER VI’ (June 6)Anticipation has been building for what seems like forever, and Tunechi has already revealed an insane list of collaborators that includes everyone from Wyclef Jean to Miley Cyrus to U2’s Bono.LITTLE SIMZ - ‘LOTUS’ (June 6)Originally expected back in May, the British rap star’s sixth album includes contributions from Michael Kiwanuka, Yussef Dayes, Sampha and more.CYNTHIA ERIVO - ‘I FORGIVE YOU’ (June 6)The singer/actress is one of the hardest-working people in entertainment. She follows up her Academy Award-nominated turn inWickedwith her second studio album – and leadoff singles “Replay” and “Worst Of Me.”SLICK RICK - ‘VICTORY’ (June 13)The artist once known as MC Ricky D hasn’t dropped an album since 1999'sThe Art Of Storytelling, but Rick The Ruler returns with a visual project courtesy of Mass Appeal — and assisted by Idris Elba.LEIKELI47 - ‘LEI KELI FT. 47 / FOR PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY’  (June 13)Executive produced by Leikeli47 and Harold Lilly, Leikeli47’s first independently released project arrives this month.

        "title": "Sly Stone: Funk Innovator Dead at 82",
        "description": "Sly Stonehas died. The music legend born Sylvester Stewart passed away Monday, June 9, at the age of 82, according to a statement from his family. As frontman of the iconic Sly & The Family Stone, Sly stands as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century; a titan of rock, soul, funk and pop that reshaped the sound of American music, all while redirecting the style and spirit of Black artistry.\nBut the band would soon be catapulted to the top of the music industry after the release of their fourth albumStand!In 1969. With hits like “Sing A Simple Song,” “Everyday People” and the title track, Sly & The Family Stone were at the forefront of funk and psychedelia. One of popular music’s first racially-integrated acts, as well as the rare band with male and female members, Sly & The Family Stone performed later that year at the iconic Woodstock Festival and scored two more major hits with “Hot Fun In the Summertime” and \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin.)\" In the early 1970s, Sly’s drug use worsened as he recorded new music. Mostly recorded on his own in Los Angeles, Sly & The Family Stone’s 1971 album,There’s A Riot Goin’ On,proved to be a landmark in funk music, and the band scored another hit with the innovative “Family Affair,” one of the first hit singles to utilize a beat machine.Over the next few years, The Family Stone would deteriorate in a haze of acrimony and drug use, as Sly continued to spearhead albums likeFreshandSmall Talkbefore he finally embarked on an official solo career with 1975'sHigh On You. Sly resumed recording under the Sly & The Family Stone moniker, but officially disbanded the group name after the George Clinton-assistedAin't But the One Wayin 1982.Sly Stone would spend his later years largely out of the spotlight and earning the reputation of a musical recluse, emerging only occasionally for events like Sly & The Family Stone’s1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the decades since his debut, Sly Stone’s music has influenced generations of artists: from Parliament-Funkadelic and the Jackson 5 to Prince and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His songs have been extensively sampled by artists like LL Cool J (“Mama Said Knock You Out”), Janet Jackson (“Rhythm Nation”), 2Pac (“Temptations”), Jungle Brothers (“Because I Got It Like That”) and Arrested Development (“People Everyday.”)Sly Stone’s psychedelic funk inspired a shift in 1960s Black music as artists moved away from the more buttoned-down, dapper presentation that was standard earlier in the decade. AfterStand!,more popular Black artists embraced the loose, hippie style that Sly & The Family Stone embodied; and producers began to channel the funky, freewheeling music the band produced. Motown artists like the Temptations and the Supremes began recording more expansive songs like “Ball Of Confusion” and “Love Child” after the success of Sly & The Family Stone; and The Corporation produced Jackson 5 hits that were heavily influenced by the sound of Sly & The Family Stone.Stone’s singular approach as a producer and songwriter forged a template forStevie Wonder,Prince,D’Angeloand countless other artists. Bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone were indebted to the melding of funk and rock that Sly & The Family Stone pioneered. The Chili Peppers covered the Sly & The Family Stone hit “If You Want Me To Stay”; Fishbone released a cover of “Everybody Is A Star.”—  (@)Questlove, who directed the documentarySly Lives! (AKA The Burden Of Black Genius), released earlier this year, recognized the impact of Stone with a post on social media.“Sly’s music will likely speak to us even more now than it did then,” he wrote on Instagram. “Thank you, Sly. You will forever live.Thankyoufaliftingushigher Sly.”DJ Premier posted on IG: “I thank you for bringing us diversity, funk, soul, rock and a unique band which is why I'm cut from the integrity cloth.

        "description": "DAYLYTsounds like he’s putting this battle to bed. The Cali rhymer has been one of the more prominent voices in the ongoing war of words between Brooklyn emceeJoey Bada$and an ever-growing list of West Coast rappers. DAYLYT was one of the first to respond to Joey’s “The Ruler’s Back” back in January, and now it seems that DAYLYT is ending things.\nOr at least, he’s ending his part in all of this.\nOn his new track, “END CREDITS,” DAYLYT makes it clear that he appreciates Joey getting everybody riled up and sparking so much creativity and lyricism. Over several classic Nas instrumentals, DAYLYT bows out.\n\"The Ruler's back, oh, you the man, Joey / Today I crown you the King of New York for taking that stand, Joey / You really took the fade with all of us, a brave man / NY-made man, it should say 'Immortal' when your grave land…”\nSince Joey dropped “The Ruler’s Back” rappers like DAYLYT, Ray Vaughn, Ab-Soul and others have entered the fray, with fans enjoying the barrage of diss records that have emerged over the past three or four months. Bada$ has more than held his own against attacks from the West. He even launcheda TDEast websiteand is now baitingKendrick Lamarto come for him, as well. And Joey hasn’t been entirely alone in representing the East: Brooklynite CJ Fly definitely entered the chat with his freestyle over DAYLYT’s “HIYU.”But at some point–you gotta call the fight.If DAYLYT is really moving on from this, at least lots more listeners are now aware of how impressive the man’s skills are.\n\nSince Joey dropped “The Ruler’s Back” rappers like DAYLYT, Ray Vaughn, Ab-Soul and others have entered the fray, with fans enjoying the barrage of diss records that have emerged over the past three or four months.

        "title": "Still Spinning: The Legacy and Future of Black Women in Dance & House Music",
        "description": "WhenCeCe Penistonbelts the first triumphant note of “Finally” at this year’sRoots Picnic, she won’t just be reviving a hit — she’ll be reminding the crowd of the powerful legacy ofBlack women in house and dance music. Appearing alongsideCrystal Watersfor Rich Medina’s Black House set, Peniston and Waters will take the stage in righteous recognition of their impact on dance music’s golden era — an era shaped by Black women whose voices set dance floors on fire and gave joy a pulse.\nAlong withMartha Wash,Robin S.,Ultra Naté, and (Soul II Soul lead singer)Caron Wheeler, Peniston and Waters are among the most important voices in house and dance music, though their influence has often been underrepresented in broader music history. At a time when music festivals are recalibrating who gets top billing, the inclusion of Peniston and Waters signals more than nostalgia — it represents a necessary shift in recognizing the women who shaped the soundtracks of liberation.\nHouse music, like hip-hop, wasborn in Black and Latinx queer communitiesin the 1970s and 1980s and quickly spread across clubs and radios globally. Women have always been central to this evolution — as vocalists, DJs, producers and cultural icons. Yet, their stories are often minimized or framed through male-dominated narratives. Peniston’s \"Finally\" wasn’t just a chart-topper — it was a global smash that brought Black women’s joy to dance floors across the world. Crystal Waters gave social commentary a four-on-the-floor beat with \"Gypsy Woman,\" blending club euphoria with lyrical substance.In 2025, these legacies don’t just live on — they reverberate through a new generation of artists who are remixing tradition and amplifying representation. Artists like UNIIQU3, Ash Lauryn, Bambii, DJ Holographic and TSHA are bridging global sounds with cultural pride and intention. And this year, one of those rising voices isSIBBY LIV, a Philly-based DJ, producer, and event curator making her Roots Picnic debut with her immersive seriesAll Spice World Dance.SIBBY LIV: Crafting New Memories on the Dance Floor\"Not only am I being a part of their history,\" Sibby says of sharing the Roots Picnic lineup with Peniston and Waters, \"but I’m also writing my own chapter in it.\"SIBBY LIV's sets are sonic mosaics. She blends Afrobeats, amapiano, Jersey club, baile funk, soca, and house, pulling influence from her Bronx birth roots, Philly upbringing and Jamaican heritage. Her series,All Spice World Dance, has evolved from a local event into a summer movement that offers an inclusive, celebratory space for music lovers to dance, explore global sounds and feel connected.\"I want them to walk away full — filled up with memories of the set and experiencing something new,\" she says of her upcoming set. \"Pure excitement. They need to be hydrated because there's going to be a lot of movement.\"That energy is by design. Sibby meticulously crafts her sets through feeling first, often describing the experience as out-of-body. \"I don’t realize what I’m doing until after I hear it,\" she says. \"The combinations I come up with sometimes surprise me, but they make sense in the moment.\"She sees the DJ booth not just as a platform, but as something of a classroom for music discovery. \"A DJ’s job is to put people on,\" she says. \"I think it’s important that I mix underground sounds with more popular or global sounds because I’m bringing awareness and also creating something new by mixing it. I do that on purpose, and to gauge the audience’s reaction to it. I love testing the waters… I’m one of those people to always break those barriers. One thing I’m not afraid to do is explore and share new sounds.”\"I create with feeling first. If it’s something that feels empty, I know others won’t feel it. Once I can feel it, then I can clean up whatever needs to be cleaned up.\" - SIBBY LIVPhoto courtesy of SIBBY LIV.A Sound That Transcends GenreSibby's approach to DJing and producing goes beyond beat matching. As a self-described \"versatile visionary,\" she constructs soundscapes that connect cultures and generations. While her sets are spontaneous and spirited, her production work demands deeper intentionality.

I just know it’d be out of this world.”Sibby’s journey is part of a larger continuum – one where Black women have long created spaces for joy, resistance, and release on the dance floor. Whether through CeCe’s voice, Crystal’s storytelling or Sibby’s sets, the throughline is clear: this music doesn’t just move bodies, it moves culture forward.\n\nHouse music, like hip-hop, wasborn in Black and Latinx queer communitiesin the 1970s and 1980s and quickly spread across clubs and radios globally. Women have always been central to this evolution — as vocalists, DJs, producers and cultural icons. Yet, their stories are often minimized or framed through male-dominated narratives. Peniston’s \"Finally\" wasn’t just a chart-topper — it was a global smash that brought Black women’s joy to dance floors across the world. Crystal Waters gave social commentary a four-on-the-floor beat with \"Gypsy Woman,\" blending club euphoria with lyrical substance.\nIn 2025, these legacies don’t just live on — they reverberate through a new generation of artists who are remixing tradition and amplifying representation. Artists like UNIIQU3, Ash Lauryn, Bambii, DJ Holographic and TSHA are bridging global sounds with cultural pride and intention. And this year, one of those rising voices isSIBBY LIV, a Philly-based DJ, producer, and event curator making her Roots Picnic debut with her immersive seriesAll Spice World Dance.\n\"Not only am I being a part of their history,\" Sibby says of sharing the Roots Picnic lineup with Peniston and Waters, \"but I’m also writing my own chapter in it.\"\nSIBBY LIV's sets are sonic mosaics. She blends Afrobeats, amapiano, Jersey club, baile funk, soca, and house, pulling influence from her Bronx birth roots, Philly upbringing and Jamaican heritage. Her series,All Spice World Dance, has evolved from a local event into a summer movement that offers an inclusive, celebratory space for music lovers to dance, explore global sounds and feel connected.\n\"I want them to walk away full — filled up with memories of the set and experiencing something new,\" she says of her upcoming set. \"Pure excitement. They need to be hydrated because there's going to be a lot of movement.\"\nThat energy is by design. Sibby meticulously crafts her sets through feeling first, often describing the experience as out-of-body. \"I don’t realize what I’m doing until after I hear it,\" she says. \"The combinations I come up with sometimes surprise me, but they make sense in the moment.\"\nShe sees the DJ booth not just as a platform, but as something of a classroom for music discovery. \"A DJ’s job is to put people on,\" she says. \"I think it’s important that I mix underground sounds with more popular or global sounds because I’m bringing awareness and also creating something new by mixing it. I do that on purpose, and to gauge the audience’s reaction to it. I love testing the waters… I’m one of those people to always break those barriers. One thing I’m not afraid to do is explore and share new sounds.”\n\"I create with feeling first. If it’s something that feels empty, I know others won’t feel it. Once I can feel it, then I can clean up whatever needs to be cleaned up.\" - SIBBY LIV\nPhoto courtesy of SIBBY LIV.\n\nSibby's approach to DJing and producing goes beyond beat matching. As a self-described \"versatile visionary,\" she constructs soundscapes that connect cultures and generations. While her sets are spontaneous and spirited, her production work demands deeper intentionality. Her upcoming single, \"Planet Sex,\" is a Miami bass-inspired track that promotes safe sex and drops on National Sex Day (June 9).\n\"I create with feeling first,\" Sibby says. \"If it’s something that feels empty, I know others won’t feel it.

        "title": "How ‘The Marshall Mathers LP’ Made Eminem the Best Rapper Alive",
        "description": "Moments after feeling sorry for himself,Eminemremembered who he used to be. As Beyoncé’s uncharacteristically somber soprano receded into the reflective piano keys of “Walk on Water,” Marshall ripped through his own coffin for a violent resurrection: “'Cause I'm just a man / But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike / So me and you are not alike / Bitch, I wrote ‘Stan.’”\nRapper Eminem, performs at the Paradiso on April 30th 2000 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.Photo by Frans Schellekens/Redferns.“The Real Slim Shady” forecasted the storm to come. Conceived as a last-minute effort to generate a hit single, the cut is powered by relentless agility and the acerbic wit of the Smart Ass Final Boss. The track sees Em scribble around the Y2K zeitgeist as he rewrites boomer fairy tales in crayon and splashes of blood.In his opening verse, he (tastelessly) name-drops Pamela Anderson before using a Tom Green reference to highlight the hypocrisy of remote-clutching parents. Where his rivals were trying to rhyme words and concepts, Eminem was melting them. Toward the middle of the opening verse, he folds syllables into each other by creating his own fringe homonyms and using assonance and a warped mind to erase the gaps between sex, politics, and macabre violence:“We ain't nothin' but mammals / Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes / But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes / Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope.”Threaded by an appropriately whimsical harpsichord and a hook that begs someone to stand up, “The Real Slim Shady”peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, crystallizing Em as an artist who was as commercial as he was controversial — a skeleton key for rap and cultural supremacy.He continues the technical and thematic pyro show on less-heralded tracks like, “Who Knew.” For that one, he sifts through various American lies with a satirist’s ruthless insight and an architect’s instincts for infrastructure. At the end of his last verse, he pokes fun at people blaming rap lyrics for school shootings, assembling and disassembling vowels, consonants and, critical rhetoric all the while:“How many r***rds'll listen to me / And run-up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a teac- / -her? Him? Is it you? Is it them? / Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!”The part where he breaks up the word teacher to go into a small barrage of finger-pointing is Tony Stark-level re-engineering — flipping twisting and rerouting parts to build new Iron Man tools instantaneously. A micro masterpiece of ingenuity and focus.And then there’s “Stan.” Jolting and driving across a haunting Dido sample, Em tells a story of the most warped kind of fandom. Developing an obsession with Em, a young man writes a series of increasingly disturbing letters before committing the type of heinous act Eminem imagines on tracks like “’97 Bonnie & Clyde.” Em then concludes the tale with an M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist of an ending, before those became run-of-the-mill in rap music. The track charted fairly well — it peaked at No. 51 on the Hot 100 in an era that was much more difficult for rap to dominate — but its cultural footprint is the astonishing part. In 2017, “Stan,” which had since come to define fans who are irrationally attached to a particular celebrity, was added to theOxford Dictionary. While his peers were writing rhymes, Em was basically helping rewrite the dictionary.While Em’s technical accomplishments are… well, accomplished, his cultural analysis is just as compelling. During an era of mass-produced boy bands and hollow moralizing, Em’s verbal defilements spotlighted the U.S.’s hidden absurdities: how could you be worried about fictional violence in a world where we’ve started wars with countries just to take their oil? How could you be mad about sexual content when your acting president is getting head from his intern? In 2002, Bill O’Reilly’s criticism causedPepsi to take away Ludacris’ sponsorship. Years later, he ironically was forced to settle several sexual harassment lawsuits. These events unfolded afterThe Marshall Mathers LPhit shelves. But they’re all fruits of the same philosophical asymmetry Em explored in his magnum opus, and they’re largely as true now as they were then. WhenThe Marshall Mathers LPwas released, Bill Clinton was our president. Trump is our current one. Like the greatest poets, Em’s best words are both of their era and eternal — a delicate balance struck at the intersection of wit and understanding.Remarkably, Eminem’s own commercial success accurately reflected both his impact and skill set. This wasn’t a case of an underground wordsmith who could only sell to purists. In its first week of release,The Marshall Mathers LPsold 1.78 million copies. The villain won: The guy who made a song about killing his wife and taking his daughter along for the ride with the body sold more first-week copies than the group that made “I Want It That Way.”Outselling the Backstreet Boys, of course, also means he was outselling other Best Rapper contenders — by a lot. Jay-Z’sVol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carterdebuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, too. But Eminem’s first-week totals nearly quadrupled his. Virtuosic as OutKast’sStankoniawas, Em’s first-week sales more than tripled theirs, too. It more than doubled DMX’sAnd Then There Was X. Among the other contenders for Best Rapper in the World, only OutKast and Jay-Z come close to matching Eminem’s level of creativity, yet none of them sold more... and there’s a chance none of them meant more. With theMarshall Mathers LP, Em reached apex rap skill. This was a demented Mos Def doing NSYNC numbers. This was something beyond that; this was a reimagining of cultural law.Eminem during Eminem signing his new release \"Marshall Mathers LP\" at Virgin Record Store - Times Square in New York City, New York, United States.Photo by KMazur/WireImageYeah, he’s white, and yeah, that helps. But that came with forgotten limitations, too. Rather than being limited by an inability to distill drug-dealing vignettes or Afrocentric fantasies, Em chose to focus on deep-frying middle American values. Basically, he sold records to white people by … talking about white people shit. And let’s be clear: the idea of making a song like “Kim” — wherein you tell the story of arguing with your wife before killing her — is some very white shit. So are all the bars about his and his mother’s drug addiction, which hit more than a little differently amid an ongoing opioid crisis in lower-income white neighborhoods. Em’s cultural prescience, bleak humor, and raw penmanship led to something genuinely novel, reaching crevices that his contemporaries couldn’t reach — if they had ever even thought to reach for them.Twenty-five years removed from its release,The Marshall Mathers LPis a masterpiece of … basically, everything. If there is a flaw, it would be the inexcusable flurries of homophobic and sexist slurs. Yes, Em’s lyrics were, as he would argue, tongue-in-cheek exercises in absurdist humor. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t embolden people who took his wordsliterallyand make life more difficult for marginalized communities everywhere. That’s a stain no surprise Elton John guest appearance could remove. In retrospect, these spurts of needless offenses scan just as heinously. They can easily get called out today. They wereheavily protested in 2000, too. But like the most powerful forces in nature, Em endured. And rose. In 2000, no rapper — nobody — elevated higher.\nRapper Eminem, performs at the Paradiso on April 30th 2000 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nPhoto by Frans Schellekens/Redferns.\n“The Real Slim Shady” forecasted the storm to come.

You have those moments in your career where that can happen — and it happens more than one time in your career — but I'm just saying that was one of those moments for me and definitely one of the most important albums in my career. I've had 20-year-olds come up and sayBewas one of their favorite albums and, you know, just people in general come up and say that was a classic album.”\nThe artist formerly known as Common Sense has been busy. He spent much of last year on the roadduring he and Pete Rock’s Auditorium Tour, a trek supporting their first-ever joint album,The Auditorium Vol. 1.Common was also featured inBilal’s 2024 concert film,Live At Glasshaus.",

        "description": "In March, Okinawan rapperAwichbrought together the biggest names from South Korea, China, Cambodia, and India for “Asian State of Mind.” It referencedNas’1994 classic by name but stripped away the nightmarish themes of living on the edge and thinking of crime in New York City to create a moment of unity and spirits aligned. “Asian State of Mind” represented superstars from their countries, rapping in their languages, and showed the eastern part of the world had something to say. In some of their lyrics, Awich callsWu-Tang Clanher “sensei,” whileKR$NAreferencesOl' Dirty Bastard’s“Shimmy Shimmy Ya.”\nEach has a special place for hip-hop in their hearts. For Awich, the military base brought a lot of American culture to Okinawa, including hip-hop, and planted the seed for her love of 2Pac. For Jay Park, a cousin put him on to Warren G’s “Regulate” and then further fed his obsession by getting into lyricists like Eminem, Canibus, and Nas. For Masiwei, it was using a VPN to access the outside world and an internet connection that got him into DJ Premier, Pete Rock, and Big L. For KR$NA, he spent part of his childhood in South London, beginning to rap as a means to fit in with his peers. For VannDa, it was his older brother who showed him hip-hop, and his curiosity led him to make songs through a cracked version of FruityLoops.Over 50 years after hip-hop was born on Aug. 11, 1973, ata party spun by DJ Kool Hercin the basement of an apartment in The Bronx, no one predicted it would be the most influential and dominant genre in the world. To examine the impact andinfluence of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) people in hip-hop, you have to start on the West Coast and the role Filipino Americans played in contributing to the culture. In The Bay, you had DJ Qbert, one of the founding members of Inivisbl Skratch Piklz, who, with DJ Apollo, became the first to operate as a turntablism band. DJ Qbert dominated the Disco Mix Club World Championships in the 1990s, winning three times and becoming an influential figure for his innovative approach to scratching and mixing techniques.Rap band The Visionaries member DJ Rhettmatic performs at the \"Save Darfur Tour\" sponsored by Playboy And Scion at the Viper Room on February 8, 2007 in West Hollywood, California.Photo by Chad Buchanan/Getty Images.DJ Rhettmatic and his crew formed the first turntable group in Cerritos, CA — a Los Angeles County suburb roughly ten miles northeast of Long Beach — called the Beat Junkies in the '90s. Over the years, notable names joined the crew, like DJ Babu. But Rhettmatic has reminisced on a time when Asian Americans had to work harder to be accepted in the culture. While speaking withHardKnock TV, he said his generation had to show and prove. \"Once you show you got heart, got skills, and all that stuff, and you went through the trenches, they respected you,\" he said. Even back then, the Filipino community was limiting themselves as good imitators, but not originators, he says, which has changed as years have gone by. Rhettmatic boasted he's a \"hip-hopper that happens to be Asian American,\" seeing more support from Filipinos as they've made significant strides in the music industry.(L-R) Jimmy Jam, Fabolous, Chad Hugo and Terry Lewis pose backstage at the Songwriters Hall of Fame 51st Annual Induction and Awards Gala at Marriott Marquis on June 16, 2022 in New York City.Photo by Gary Gershoff/Getty Images for Songwriters Hall of Fame.Chad Hugo is a name many recognize for his mythical run in the 2000s as one-half of The Neptunes. In previous interviews, he talked about how his introduction to American pop culture came from radio and television after his parents, who immigrated from the Philippines and moved to New Jersey before settling in West Virginia. The silent partner of Pharrell, Hugo met him in band camp in 1990 and famously wowed New Jack Swing impresario Teddy Riley at a local talent show that they entered as The Neptunes. Hugo and Pharrell bonded over their experience of seeing colors when hearing sounds, birthing their melodic and futuristic production that made them the most prolific and hottest duo of the 21st century.Dumbfoundead speaks onstage during the Gold House 4th Annual Gold Gala at The Music Center on May 10, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Gold House.If there were a Mt. Rushmore of Asian American rappers, Dumbfoundead and MC Jin would be on it. Dumbfoundead grew up in the Koreatown district of Los Angeles, drawing from the city's melting pot. He got into freestyling and rapping, learning from the open mic stylings of the Project Blowed crew. He battled everywhere in L.A., earning his stripes as a nerdy Asian kid who was being himself, the complete opposite of the gangsta Asian rappers who were battling at the time.MC Jin’s big break also came from battle rap, cementing himself in106 & Parkhistory by winning seven consecutive weeks on Freestyle Friday. He rapped in both English and Cantonese, eventually impressing Ruff Ryders, who gave him a record deal. MC Jin was the first Asian American rapper to be signed to a major label, following in the footsteps of Philadelphia group Mountain Brothers, who were the first Chinese American rap group to sign to Ruffhouse Records. Both Dumbfoundead and MC Jin’s music showed how being unapologetically Asian would empower generations of MCs who saw that an Asian American could be a presence in hip-hop. Most of us saw Dumb and Jin on our TV screens, thinking we could be them too.Artists of Asian descent have influenced hip-hop, too. While there are many to mention, an important name to note was the late Japanese hip-hop producer Jun Seba — otherwise known as Nujabes — who was a wizard of beat alchemy, known for his choice of jazz beats combined with repetitive drum loops and mellow samplesto create lo-fi hip-hop. He was popular for his work onSamurai Champloo, soundtracking the anime, and the main reason he has a cult following here in the West.Another is Anderson .Paak, who is a Dr. Dre protégé and master of versatility, seamlessly switches from drumming, singing, and rapping. Growing up around the church and gospel music, .Paak has stated that 2Pac and Snoop Dogg were his main influences in rap that he wanted to be a gangster rapper at first. He has shown us what not being put in a box looks like as a multi-instrumentalist, becoming heavily sought after as a producer for his funk-infused music. There's only oneXXLFreshman who took the new artist spotlight onComptonand became a bigger star.Anderson .Paak attends the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 18, 2024 in Paris, France.Photo by Julien M. Hekimian/Getty Images.When you zoom out to today, the cultural exchange between hip-hop and East Asian culture is more prevalent than ever. Wu-Tang Clan's deep appreciation for kung-fu films was the catalyst for more callbacks to martial arts in hip-hop, like Kendrick Lamar's Kung-Fu Kenny moniker, a reference to Don Cheadle'sRush Hour 2character. RZA teamed up with Awich for an upcoming project he's producing, with the first single, “Butcher Shop” featuring FERG, already being teased.Megan Thee Stallioncollaborated with Yuki Chiba, one of Japan's hottest rappers right now, after “Team Tomodachi” went viral. Nas and Divine are an unexpected duo, bridging Queensbridge and Mumbai. Blackpink’s Lisa joined forces with Atlanta’s Future. K-pop it-girl JENNIE and TDE it-girl Doechii. Sexyy Red and DaBaby recently collaborated on a video treatment for “Hoochie Coochie,” set in a massage parlor and styled with a Chinese-inspired theme. Hip-hop and Asian culture are a pairing that has gone from trying to prove yourself to fit in to becoming a lucrative move in global reach.AAPI artists are no longer guests and have a seat at the table. It's the work put in by 88Rising that shined a light on international acts for Western audiences to learn more about and invest in Asian artists locally. It's the impact of rap competition shows like South Korea’sShow Me the Moneyand China’sThe Rap of Chinathat widens the spotlight for more unheard talent to be heard. It's on the shoulders of guys like MC Jin that Brooklyn rapper Khantrast can ask the internet if Asians are invited to the cookout after his track “Landed in Brooklyn” went viral. Asians in hip-hop are part of the very fabric of the culture, constantly evolving their sounds through their historic participation in the genre. It’s past due for hip-hop heads to start widening their scope and start paying attention to hip-hop from other parts of the world.

        "title": "Joey Bada$$’ 20 vs. 1: A Breakdown of the Rap Battle Royale",
        "description": "Joey Bada$started the year off by throwing down the gauntlet.\nBack in January, the Brooklyn rhymer kicked off 2025 with “The Ruler’s Back,” an East Coast banger (right down to theSlick Rick/Jay-Znod in the title) that took aim at West Coast contemporaries and announced that Joey was taking no prisoners. Since the release of the song, it’s been months of lyrical sparring between Joey and a seemingly ever-growing list of Golden State emcees looking to put him in his place. In particular, TDE’sRay VaughnandDAYLYThave led the charge against Joey, alongside fellow Angelenos AZChike and Reason.\nFor his part, Bada$ has more than held his own against attacks from the West. He even launcheda TDEast websiteand is now baitingKendrick Lamarto come for him, as well. And Joey hasn’t been entirely alone in representing the East: Brooklynite CJ Fly definitely entered the chat with his freestyle over DAYLYT’s “HIYU.”\nThere’s a whole lot going on, but don’t worry — we’ve got you covered. Below isOkayplayer’sbreakdown of all the action.\nJoey Bada$$ “The Ruler’s Back”It’s funny how one verse could mess up the game. Or one song, at least. Joey was blasting with both barrels – calling out West Coast stans after Kendrick Lamar’s triumphant 2024. January seems so long ago now, doesn’t it?DAYLYT “HIYU”It was DAYLYT who struck back first. Within days of “The Ruler’s Back,” the South Central representer made it clear that Joey’s hostility will not stand.Ray Vaughn “Crashout Heritage”But Vaughn wasn’t too far behind with his response to “The Ruler’s Back” and he quickly emerged as the forerunner to go at Joey, calling out Bada$ for sneak-dissin’ and coming for the West Coast.Joey Bada$$ “Sorry Not Sorry”After inciting those reactions, Bada$ finally issued his response — and he doubled down. His first salvo was more of a tap – now he’s throwing punches. Mind you — this wasstillJanuary.CJ Fly “HIYU Freestyle”By now — things were getting interesting. And CJ Fly joined the proceedings. The Pro Era rapper makes it clear that Joey isn’t standing entirely alone in this. But it doesn’t seem like Bada$$ needs any backup.DAYLYT “YHRR”Battling is bred in his DNA, so it was obvious DAYLYT was licking his chops as things escalated. He swung back at Joey in February with this NYC-mocking banger.Ray Vaughn “Impossible Patty”Like “fake beef,” get it? Beyond burgers. Sometimes it’s all about endurance. Vaughn’s proving that he can go round-for-round — and mushing Joey a bit for playing in his face.Joey Bada$$ “Pardon Me”He’srappin’rappin.’ Regardless of where anyone stands in terms of who they’re rooting for; it’s clear that Joey brought his strongest pen game to the proceedings.DAYLYT “BACKPACK”It may seem like purely nostalgic reminiscing, but DAYLYT gets more digs in throughout the wistful looking back. Some of his best bars — while also referencing “HIYU.”Ray Vaughn “Justin Credible’s Freestyle”In case it wasn’t clear, this battle has been aboutbars. Vaughn’s lyricism on full display here. Handling every beat switch like a champ. There isn’t a person alive who can sleep on the dude anymore.Joey Bada$$, Big Sean, Ab-Soul “Red Bull Spiral Freestyle”Big Sean is there, but this is Joey and Ab-Soul getting some things off their respective chests. The two emcees with another entry in the ongoing feud, as Ab makes it clear he’s going to rep for his coast and his brethren.Ray Vaughn “Hoe Era”That freestyle seemed to activate something in Vaughn. He fired back with the inflammatory “Hoe Era,” referencing KDot (again) and mocking Joey’s stint onPower.Joey Bada$$ “The Finals”A chest-thumping anthem if ever there was one, Joey made it sound like victory was inevitable on this one. He jumps off the rope to reference Kendrick Lamar, Top Dawg, and Reason — while making it sound like he’s already claiming the trophy.REASON “The Dead Apple”Using classic NYC hip-hop to go in on Joey was cleverly petty, as a former TDE soldier entered the chat. Reason may not be the headliner in this war of words — but he absolutely made his presence felt.AzChike “What Would You Do?”The L.A. native steps into the fray with this slice of classic Death Row. With a “watch your mouth” and that Post Malone reference, Chike ain’t playin games.DAYLYT “WRD2MIMVA”After the Red Bull cypher and “Finals,” DAYLYT fires back. He even name-dropped Joey’s guy, the late Capital Steez. And yet another hilarious mockup of NYC slang.Joey Bada$$, Loaded Lux “MY TOWN”After he was the target ofthreediss tracks, Joey recruits one of the best battlers to ever spit for this takedown of Chike. A staunch reminder to stay out of things if they don’t involve you.Ray Vaughn “Golden Eye”Just hours later…Joey and Vaughn are center stage by this point, and Vaughn doesn’t hold back on this production from J. White Did It. Those Diddy references? It’s getting ugly.DAYLYT “AYO”DAYLYT had a response ready to go within hours, as well. Firing back at Bada$ and Lux, DAYLYT has started to separate himself from the pack in this musical melee.Joey Bada$$ “Crash Dummy”Joey’s retort saw him pumping “TDEast” and bragging that Top Dawg needed him to put their up-and-coming emcees on. After four months, he’s still in top form.Really Jae'Won “Bobby M. (New York Is Fine)”He’s been steadily building his name and now the young emcee (and son of Jadakiss) is throwing his hit into the arena. Just some hardcore, NYC-reppingbarsand a chance to show and prove.DAYLYT “ICANTHOLDUTHISA” and “WORDISBON”And DAYLYT responds in record time withtwo —that’s right,two —more diss tracks for Joey. There’s rarely been a rap feud this sprawling with tracks released at this speed — with this kind of lyrical chops on display.DAYLYT “End Credits”DAYLYT just won’t let up, huh? He returned with more heat when he dropped “End Credits” after already unloading two Joey diss tracks simultaneously.“Joey, you really took the fade with all of us, a brave man. NY-made man, it's just immortal when your grave land,”he raps on his latest. This thing could still be going in 2026.\n\nIt’s funny how one verse could mess up the game. Or one song, at least.

        "title": "The Top 5 Moments From Kendrick Lamar and SZA MetLife Stadium Performance",
        "description": "If any two artists have embodied the term “co-headliners” more thanKendrick LamarandSZA, I haven’t seen them. During an overcast Friday at MetLife Stadium, the two turned theirGrand National Tourstop into exercise in momentum, alternating between sets of songs in a way that felt completely symbiotic. Kendrick would pop out to perform four or five tracks fromGNXandDAMN.before SZA pulled up to dive intoCTRLandS.O.S., and there was essentially never a lull in the show (and, on top of that: the personal pizzas at MetLife were surprisingly affordable — a pleasant surprise for a beleaguered writer who left his home office to rush to the early-ish starting show in another state).\nPulling up for the East Rutherford, New Jersey showing, Okayplayer experienced the show in all of its virtuosity. Here are our top five moments from the concert.\n5. Kendrick Bringing Out Baby Keem\nSo, funny thing: Baby Keem is still alive. I jest, but when “Backseat Freestyle” phased into “Family Ties,” I was utterly shocked. One, because bro never posts on Instagram, doesn’t drop new music a lot, and I genuinely hadn’t seen or heard from him since seeing Kendrick at Barclays Center a few years ago. Two, because his appearance materialized so suddenly with the seamless beat switch. It felt like a moment of unexpected triumph, and the crowd was just as electrified as me. In a show filled with spectacle, Keem's appearance made you say, \"Look at that!\"\n4. SZA Performing “Nobody Gets Me” Dressed as Star Fairy\nThe atmosphere of the whole show was equal parts engrossing and meticulous. At one point home videos from Kendrick’s Compton childhood flashed across the screen as he knelt atop a GNX while performing “DNA.” The lights werelighting, the dancers weredancing.The singer wassinging. The rapper wasrapping. All that. But my favorite part was when SZA put on a fairy fit and hung suspended above the stage to perform “Nobody Gets Me.” During the performance, the backscreen turned from a pinkish skyline to a starry night as SZA laid bare her feelings. Spacy and ethereal AF, it played out like your fave suddenly deciding to deliver an interstellar musical. Basically, it was a quirky alt girl's fantasy.\n3. Kendrick’s Transition Sequences from Playboi Carti’s “Good Credit” to “Money Trees”\nOne thing about Kendrick: he won’t do the same thing twice (at least, outside of his own tours). Across his 20 or 30-something song set, he found new ways to reimagine and re-contextualize tracks from his own discog. An Anita Baker sample became the new audio canvas for “Maad City,” which suddenly melted into the super-charged “Alright.” His whole show was kind of like that, and the inventive sequences reached their peak when he flipped from Playboi Carti’s “Good Credit” (which Kung Fu Kenny features on) to “Count Me Out” to “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe” and “Money Trees.” It all worked perfect tonally. For example, the pre-hook for “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe” became the hook for “Count Me Out.” As inventive as it was electric, the sequence did the exact opposite of killing the vibe.\n2. “Not Like Us”\nThis one’s not too hard, as “Not Like Us” — aka, the 2025 Grammy winner for SongandRecord of the Year — remains as exhilarating now as it was when he first dropped it. Sorry Drake, but there’s just a visceral thrill in shouting, “Wop, wop, wop, wop — Dot, fuck ‘em up” with 30,000 other people in unison. People were spilling beers in the MetLife stairs, taking selfie videos and relishing every moment of the gleeful character exorcism, and Kendrick's sharp vocal inflections carried all the weight of a fiery pastor's sermon.\n1. The Chemistry of the Performance\nSZA and KDot’s interplay was every bit as smooth as you would have imagined, and it even came down to the way the show was sequenced. Whereas most co-headlining performances can feel apart from one another, Kendrick and SZA balanced their clusters of songs in a way that gave the show a sense of propulsion. Just when you were riding the wave of “TV Off,” SZA popped out to join Kendrick for “30 for 30.” When Kendrick performed “LOVE.,” SZA jumped in to perform Zacari’s hook (which, sorry Zacari, sounds a lil’ better). It didn’t feel like anyone got shafted here; if you wanted the apex Kendrick or SZA concert, you got both. More than any one instance or live track rendition, Kendrick and SZA’s total show was collectivelythemoment. Grand, indeed.",

I had a manager at the time and I always wonder if that’s how it got botched.\"\nView this post on InstagramA post shared by Red Bull Music (@redbullmusic)Elsewhere in the interview, Bada$ talked about the significance of 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. and their different approaches to rhyming.“Biggie, to me, is just like a flow master,” Joey noted. “He’s got one of the hardest flows ever. And then ’Pac to me is just all spirit. He’s got that purpose, he’s gonna give you a message. He’s gonna speak to you. So I think those two elements right there are what I carry for sure.”Joey would also go on to work with 50 Cent, whom he also mentioned in the Red Bull conversation.

        "description": "“You can’t say, ‘I fuck with the gospel album,’ come on, my nigga,”Snoop Doggtells me, moments after I give him props for the gospel LP Death Row Records dropped last month. I did, indeed, fuck with the album,Altar Call,but, amid laughter, and in the face of Snoop’s preternatural comedic timing, I realize he’s right and promptly correct myself: “I thoroughly enjoyed it.”\nIt’s a mostly funny screw-up on my part — but if I’m being fair to myself, you can’t blame me; I’d just finished listening to tracks fromIz It a Crime?, a new Snoop album that’s decidedly very un-gospel. Sipping a lovely Snoop 19 Crimes tequila pineapple in a swanky midtown Manhattan lounge Tuesday night, I absorbed Snoop’s latest — a project that’s equal parts celebratory and vindictive. “This is something that’s been in my heart for the past eight months,” he told a listening session audience that included Busta Rhymes, Benny The Butcher, Statik Selektah and a few incredibly distinguished and nearly as cool journalists like myself. “This shit is calledIz It a Crime?because I feel like when we get to a certain point in this career that we call music, we get judged for everything. Whether it’s good or bad. And I just wanna ask a question: Is it a crime? The shit that I do?”\nAfter tasting some of his son Cordell’s delicious apple pie Dr. Bombay Ice Cream and regrettably forgetting to try out Dr. Dre and Snoop’s Gin & Juice brand, I began listening to Snoop try to answer the question he just asked. Here, Snoop makes time to address his President Trump inauguration performance, raps with Sexyy Red, and takes some shots at Suge Knight on “Shut Yo Bitchass Up”:“I can see why you mad, I bought everything you own / Now you in PC snitching on the phone.”The music served as the soundtrack for an accompanying film that could’ve been called,Snoop Dogg is a Rap Legend, and Besides That, Just a Really Cool Nigga. The endless clips of people giving him props juxtaposed with music videos and reflections on his own family manage to feel self-mythological, yet intermittently, genuinely humble. A cynical person — someone not like me, at all — might say it was just some self-indulgent album promo. But, to be fair, Snoop’s charisma is such that it would be super entertaining anyway. And then also, there’s the fact that Snoop’s generally been pretty open even at his lowest moments; whatever this movie is called feels like the best-case scenario sequel toMurder Was the Case.The music itself is pretty good, and I’m not just saying that because I’m tipsy and a little engulfed by the presence of the guy that made “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” did cooking shows with Martha Stewartandcreated his own suffix (let he who hasn’t needlessly added “izzle” to a random word cast the first stone). The Sexyy Red collab is fun, and the Denaun-assisted “Cold Summer” is a track that’s simultaneously macabre, hilarious and groovy. At press time, I’m listening to the whole album and it still sounds cool, even after the tequila’s long-since worn off. But during the actual event, the deftly mixed drink, and perhaps some of Uncle Snoop’s weed smoke, inspires me to live out the Hit the Blunt Meme (in other words, more properly do my job) by diving into an existential question: How is Snoop adjusting to the new frontier of technologyandentertainment? He’s been at the center of it for a long time now.Thirteen years ago — long before AI fully sprang forth to threaten my job and just about everything else I hold dear (re: my job) — Snoop and Dr. Dre took the stage to perform with an AI-adjacent2Pac at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival. The moment was pretty neat at the time, but I remember being a little, “ehh” about the moral logistics of it all. The idea surfaced again when Drake includedan AI Pac and AI Snoop verseto his Kendrick Lamar diss track, “Taylor Made.” Snoop himself acknowledged the song playfully, for which Kendrick called him out on hisGNXtrack, “Wacced Out Murals.” Snoop took Kendrick’s point in stride and apologized.But all this made me get to thinking: Snoop didn’t outwardly say anything bad about people using AI, and he himself was at the center of a Pac-related landmark moment for AI technology. So then, would he ever be open to doing a collaboration with an AI version of Makaveli the Don? In short, no.“I don’t know about an AI song with 2Pac, because to me, it ain’t real when I got real records with him,” Snoop toldOkayplayer. “When we made records, we sat next to each other. We didn’t battle each other, but we was on each other’s head like, ‘Say some dope shit,’ and then go in the booth, and he’s in there cheering me on, and I’m cheering him on.’ AI can’t give you that shit,” Snoop added. “That nigga’s a robot.”So, while Snoop stops short of saying it would be a crime, don’t count on a Snoop and AI Pac single for a while — or, ever. If you want to check out actual Pac and Snoop tracks, just check out “2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,” “Wanted Dead or Alive,” or the officially unreleased, but still out there cut, “Street Life.” If you want to check outIz It a Crime?, check it out on DSPs.

        "description": "Lupe Fiasco’srole as a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology continues to inspire the Chicago emcee.According toWBUR, Fiasco is now creating songs directly inspired by MIT. As a proponent of “ghotiing,” (pronounced “fishing”), Lupe is now sending his MIT students on outings to various public art pieces across campus to “fish for musical inspiration.”\nFiasco is letting MIT sculptures become the catalyst for his latest music. He and MIT initially joined forces back in 2022, when the “Streets On Fire” rapper announced that he was joining the institution as an expert in arts and humanities. Now, Fiasco is back at MIT, expanding on the idea of site-responsive music.\nThe music Fiasco has created since joining MIT helps to promote the school’s percent-for-art program, which commissions new permanent art every time there’s a major campus construction project.“Once it’s given to the curators, and they decide where to kind of put and place, you realize that, ‘Oh, there’s a wider story that’s being told on campus, a very quiet story, but big and loud,” he explained.Fiasco songs like “Funhouse Flavor” and “Molecule Flavor” are inspired by sculptures on MIT’s campus by sculptors such as Alexander Calder. Lupe hosted his first viewing alongside the MIT Jazz Ensembleearlier this month. Fiasco was also inspired by impressionist painters like Monet and Cezanne, who would paint the same scenes over and over, but in different settings and contexts like varied times of day.“You don't need to be the same as everybody else to keep up,” Fiasco says. “You just need to be your asymmetrical self.”Lupe Fiasco’s forays into higher education aren’t limited to MIT.Back in January, he announced via Instagram that he would be a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.“Thrilled to share that I’ll be joining the faculty at the prestigious Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute in fall 2025 as a distinguished visiting professor, teaching rap as part of the groundbreaking new four-year hip-hop degree program,” Lupe wrote, adding that the program is led by Wendel Patrick, who was previously a Nasir Jones hip-hop fellow at the Hiphop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard.“The Peabody Institute is one of the oldest music conservatories in America,” he continued. “World-renowned for its rigorous training and for producing some of the world’s greatest musicians, and I’m honored to contribute to this legacy doing what I love most, rap.”\nThe music Fiasco has created since joining MIT helps to promote the school’s percent-for-art program, which commissions new permanent art every time there’s a major campus construction project.\n“Once it’s given to the curators, and they decide where to kind of put and place, you realize that, ‘Oh, there’s a wider story that’s being told on campus, a very quiet story, but big and loud,” he explained.\nFiasco songs like “Funhouse Flavor” and “Molecule Flavor” are inspired by sculptures on MIT’s campus by sculptors such as Alexander Calder.

        "title": "Was Kendrick Lamar Versus Drake the Last Great Rap Battle?",
        "description": "OGs love waxing poetic about the olden times, but to their credit — if you can read between the lines of era-related bias and barbershop talkery — they have a point. Sometimes — sometimes — some shit is every bit as dope as their memories tell them.\nYou didn’t need the benefit of hindsight to realize “The Bridge Is Over” wasit.No one can tell you “Takeover” didn’t make the world stop. If they can, it’s only because “Ether” reanimated it. AfterJay-Z and Nas’ oft-mythologized war of words, the world of rap battles returned to a stasis. Sure, folks had back-and-forths, but those contests were usually too one-sided to be mentioned in the same breath, or the differences in commercial success made choosing a victor a moot point. This time last year,Kendrick LamarandDrakebrought motion to the seemingly lifeless rap tradition when theytraded diss tracksover a multi-week flurry that felt like it defined 2024. This Sunday, May 4, will mark exactly one year since Kendrick ended it. Released as part of a sly double counterstrike,“Not Like Us”was the explosive crescendo of a titanic battle we really didn’t even think could happen — the answer to the question of, “what if Russia and the U.S. just said ‘fuck it,’ ya know?” Kendrick won in a knockout, but they both squabbled up and delivered an instant classic. And as far as rap battles go, however, it might be the last of its kind.\nThrough years of shapeshifting musical structures, increasingly free associative writing and, punching in, and frankly, murder, the notion of truly high-stakes rap battles had been a dormant one. And, following the Drizzy V. Kung Fu Kenny melee, it’s probably headed back to hibernation. It’s a fate dictated as much by cultural shifts as their stature as philosophically opposed giants. Drake has more Hot 100 hits than any artist… ever. And he’s written hit singles for everyone from Jamie Foxx to Alicia Keys. Kendrick won a Pulitzer Prize forDAMN., and “Not Like Us” literally won Song of the YearandRecord of the Year. Both are rap formalists with multiple No. 1 singles and the mic skills to eviscerate any beat — and mostly — any opponent set before them. The folks that can rap near that level never match their commercial success; the ones that have the commercial success rarely rap near that level. It’s an existential seesaw that could eventually render past classic rap battles … well … things of the past.“This battle does mark, in my opinion, a bit of an inflection point, because I think we have a lot of fans now who are not rap fans,” says Sowmya Krishnamurthy, author ofFashion Killa: How Hip-Hop Revolutionized High Fashion. “They’re fans of this sort of nebulous culture, where it's about vibes and what's on the charts and what's trending. That’s what they're running toward. It’s not good or bad, but that's very different from people who know rap.”For veteran industry exec and media personality Wayne “Wayno” Clark, the potential dearth of A-Lister rap battles comes down to maturity. Or rather, a lack thereof. “There’s a lot of men that just don't know how to control their emotions … they would rather get into it in real life,” says Wayno, the creator and host ofI’ll Do It Myself.“Nobody wants to take an L. Nobody wants to be able to say that somebody got one up on them. So it's like the whole culture of today is, when it comes to some sort of conflict, it’s about can I get you up out of here…” The answer to that question can be a lot of things. A snarky tweet. A funny Instagram post. Or, much more tragically, a brazen killing.Four years ago, both Young Dolph and Drakeo The Ruler were murdered in their respective hometowns, with many alleging the slayings to be connected to long-simmering rap beef. Both delivered scathing diss tracks that went largely unresponded to, and instead of philosophical rap debates, people debated about murder suspects. Instead of recalling all the exhilarating highs of a well-executed punchline, people felt the recoil of tragedy. While they weren’t A-listers in a conventional sense, the manner — and the context — of their deaths stands as a reminder that the distance between street rap and the literal streets has never been smaller.As a young A&R at Roc-A-Fella Records amid D-Block’s beef with State Property more than 20 years ago, Wayno remembers close calls; cars filled with guns, ammunition, and folks more than willing to use all of it. “We were moving like the military,” he recalls. “And they were, too.” Still, things thankfully stayed on wax. With the advent of drill music, Wayno says, rap beef took a more consistently murderous turn.“If you 10 years old, you came up off Chief Keef and them, their beefing was a different level of beefing. It was about music, but it was about real violence that was happening in the street at that very moment,” Wayno says. “When I came up in music, it was really dangerous where they would say what they wanted to do to you, and if they got up with you and it was like that then it could go there. But it wasn't in the studio. It wasn't like, ’Oh no, we going to hurt these dudes in real life.’”For his part, Styles P remembers tasting all flavors of beef 20 years ago. A not-so-playful back-and-forth with Roc-A-Fella. A playful tiff with 50 Cent. And then the literal street beef makes that rap beef seem as meaningful as a random pickup game. “When you're in the midst of really going through some shit in real life and it’s really happening, you're not really looking at rap beef as other beef,” says The Ghost. “Even though it could go down, it's a lot lighter than actually having a beef with people in a closer proximity to you.”Still, that doesn’t mean Styles didn’t have fun, and just like everyone else, he enjoyed last year’s Drizzy versus K. Dot matchup. “Rap was a little too friendly for me,” he shares. “It just felt like it lacked competitiveness. Have you ever gone to a basketball court to not be the MVP? I'm here with a team, but do I want everybody else to score more than me? What kind of mind state is that to have?”“I like to joke that it felt like everyone was being friends with each other, which on one hand is great, that everyone is friends with each other, but it's terrible for rap competition,” adds Krishnamurthy. Wayno appreciated the competitive fireworks, too. But the conversations surrounding them — an overflow of non-sequitur arguments, judgy condemnations, and crystalline Standom — were more than a little irritating by the end of the bout.“When Ebro [Darden] said the whole thing aboutDrake being a sickness, I was just like, ‘Yo bro, come on,’” Wayno continues. “I felt like [Drake] handled the post-battle terribly. But to say this man is ‘a sickness’ and we've been listening to this man’s music … I'm not looking at it that deep. Because if we start looking into shit that deep, we gotta cut out mad people’s music — not just R. Kelly.”The “post-battle” stuff Wayno mentions is Drake’s lawsuit against UMG, which alleges that they used bots in order to boost numbers for “Not Like Us,” which, at press time, has over 1.4 billion Spotify streams. “At the point where you challenge me to a fight — not knowing that I know  jiu jitsu — and you swing on me and I pull your ass on the floor and stretch you into four different ways like a pretzel and now you're crying because you're down and you've never felt this pain… don't start saying, now I want to call the authorities,” Wayno says. “It's not even fun,” he adds. ”Everything after the battle made it not fun.”“I think the suing thing is something that’s definitely never happened before,” adds Styles. “So that's very shocking to see. It’s almost like he couldn't handle losing. I didn't think he lost badly, he just didn't win. But I think with social media, it magnified [the loss],” Styles continues. “Somebody should have told him, whenever you're on top like that, people could love you, but they'll be happy to see you fall as well.” People might have seen Drake fall, but the sheer enormity of the spectacle remains its own kind of landmark accomplishment.According toBillboard,Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show, wherein he performed “Not Like Us,” reached 133.5 million viewers, a total that eclipsed Michael Jackson’s Super Bowl Halftime show 32 years prior. While his diss tracks didn’t reach the commercial peaks of “Not Like Us,” “Family Matters” still hit No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and, despite large-scale belief that Kenny collected the W, plenty of folks rode hard for Drizzy’s best shots. Yeah. Insert whichever “hip-hop won” kind of phrase you want. But it’s true.“We really saw two artists at the top of their game; two gladiators going head-to-head,” Krishnamurthy says. “And I think just as far as focusing on the records, talking about hip-hop again, it really did inject a lot of excitement and interest just within the idea of rapping. And it had been a long time.” But how long will it be until the next time? Can there be one?“I would think so, because I look at rap as a competitive verbal sport,” Styles says. “I don't think it'll be soon, but I do think that it'll happen again. I don't know if I'll be around to witness when the next one happens, but hopefully so.”If not, we’ll just have to recline in our barber chair, endure some heinous takes and remember the good ol’ days.\nThrough years of shapeshifting musical structures, increasingly free associative writing and, punching in, and frankly, murder, the notion of truly high-stakes rap battles had been a dormant one.

        "description": "André 3000has been busy lately.

For this one, 3 Stacks announces the number of each track before going to work. It’s all pretty raw — almost like … a sketch. Between this and his 2023 flute album, it feels like he’s collecting different instrumental albums like infinity stones. Interesting stuff.\nThis EP was preceded by some mysterious social media posts that now appear to be related to what he just dropped. When the Atlanta legend shared that he was looking for a blue notebook with “black sketches and notes inside,” fans immediately began speculating what the cryptic message could mean.\nWhile arep for Dresaid he was just looking for his notebook, it all definitely feels like a clever rollout. “He really is seeking help on finding it,” his teamtoldAllHipHop. “It contains sketches and he’s hoping someone in Amsterdam will have picked it up from wherever it was lost.”\nThis news arrives as 3 Stacks andBig Boiawait their officialgetting inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fameinduction this fall. The duo debuted in 1994 and went on to one of the most acclaimed careers in hip-hop; breaking down doors for southern rap, rattling off hit singles (“Elevators,” “Mrs. Jackson”) and critically-hailed albums likeAqueminiandStankonia–eventually taking home the Album Of The Year Grammy in 2004 for their smash double albumSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\nNow, 3 Stacks adds another new chapter to his legacy.

        "description": "Lauryn Hillrecently sat down for a roundtable discussion at Harvard University on Friday, where she explained why it’s important to find community when creating music. The Fugees frontwoman and multi-Grammy winner explained her approach to songwriting and shared her advice for burgeoning artists.\n—  (@)“I find what I love, I find what I care about and then I write about that. I have mind and motion and need — combined. That’s what I do, which I’m sure all of you are doing. Purpose. Love.

        "title": "A Brief History of the Predatory Record Deal",
        "description": "Additional reporting by Meka Udoh.\nOn“Check the Rhyme”from A Tribe Called Quest’s 1991 vanguardThe Low End Theory,Q-Tipmemorably quipped,“Industry Rule No. 4080: Record company people are shady.”There are legions of artists who would agree with the sentiments of The Abstract, who have encountered the evils of such economic exploitation.\nThe record business has (allegedly) scammed countless musicians out of their masters, publishing rights, royalties, and just about everything else under the sun. Artists who lacked the proper knowledge and/or — more importantly — legal representation would be taken advantage of by labels and publishers with complex contracts.\nWhile America was caught in the wave that was rock and roll music in the ‘50s, Black musicians were unsurprisingly gate-kept from and exploited by labels all too eager to profit off their blood, sweat, and melodies. Chuck Berry, widely regarded as the founding father of the genre, launched his career with his iconic tune “Maybelline” on Chess Records. However, Alan Freed (a radio disc jockey credited with actually popularizing the term “rock and roll”) and Russ Fratto (the landlord of Chess Records, the label Berry was signed to) werecredited as the song’s co-writers, giving them a share of the royalties. For decades, Berry persistently fought a legal battle to reclaim ownership of his work, and in 1986, his efforts were finally recognized when he was officially awarded full credit for the song.Little Richard's masterpiece lined other pocketsSimilarly, in 1956, Little Richardsold the publishing rights to his classic \"Tutti Frutti\"to Specialty Records owner Art Rupe for a mere $50. Additionally, his contract would only pay himless than one centfor each record sold, significantly less than the standard 3-5 percent rate that artists received. While the 1955 classic \"Tutti Frutti” would go on to sell over 500,000 copies, Little Richardwould only receive $25,000from those sales. To add insult to injury, Richard would not receive royalties even when his music was covered by other artists, notably Pat Boonein 1956. In 1984, Little Richard filed a $112 million lawsuit against Specialty Records, claiming he hadn’t received royalties since leaving the label in 1959. He eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and later, after Michael Jackson purchased ATV in 1985, which, among with The Beatles, owned the rights to Little Richard’s publishing — Jackson returned those rights to him.Prince and Michael Jackson missed out on millionsPrince performs on stage wearing 'Slave' tattoo, on 'The Ultimate Live Experience' tour at Wembley Arena on March 4th, 1995 in London, United Kingdom.Photo by Pete Still/Redferns.PrinceandMichael Jacksonwere two of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful artists of all time. Yet both legends were forced to fight their labels over contracts that exploited their talents and denied them a fair share of the profits from their work.Prince endured a four-decade battle with Warner Music, all stemming from when he signed his first deal in 1977 at the naive age of 18. Following the massive success he experienced in the 1980s, The Purple One would ink a $100 million deal with the label in 1991, which at the time was considered the biggest recording contract in history. But things soured quickly, as Prince felt that under the deal with Warner, they owned and controlled his name as well as any music released under that name. As a result, Prince would change his name to an unpronounceable emblem (called the “Love Symbol”) and would be referred to as “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince,” and during live appearances and performances wrote “Slave” on his face in protest. To get out of the deal, Prince would have to fulfill his contractual obligations with several album releases between 1995 and 1996:The Gold Experience,Chaos and Disorder,Emancipation, and the soundtrack to the filmGirl 6. Once freed from his deal, Prince became a vocal advocate for artists' rights, subsequently opting for distribution deals with labels rather than traditional record contracts until his passing in 2016.Following his legendary run from 1979’s Off the Wall to 1995’sHIStory: Past, Present and Future(released via Epic Records, a Sony label), Jackson grew increasingly critical of the label and its then-CEO Tommy Mottola, accusing him of “racist” and “manipulative” business practices after what he felt was the mishandling of his 2001 albumInvincible. He also expressed frustration over the release of the compilation albumNumber Onesin 2003. In a twist of irony, in 2016 Sony acquired the Jackson estate’s remaining 50 percent stake in Sony/ATV for $750 million, securing full ownership of the publishing catalog, after previously purchasing half of Jackson’s own music catalog for a reported $600 million.Jackson would pass away in 2009, at the age of 50.De La Soul's years of missed streaming revenueDe La Soul arrive at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards at the American Airlines Arena August 29, 2004 in Miami, Florida.Photo by Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.De La Soulis a cautionary tale for how a shoddy record deal can have a devastating impact in the streaming era.For years, the Native Tongues trio was embroiled in a complicated contractual dispute over sample clearances with their label Tommy Boy Records when they sued forcopyright infringement. After Tommy Boy reacquired the rights to their first six albums from Warner Bros., the group alleged that label founder and CEO Tom Silverman offered them a 90/10 profit split ahead of plans to bring their music to streaming platforms in 2019. The long shadow of their early contracts meant the group missed out on years of streaming revenue, as their music remained absent from digital platforms and ownership of their master recordings remained out of reach. While De La Soul was able toreach a dealwith Reservoir Records to release their music and finally own their masters David Jude Jolicoeur — also known as Trugoy the Dove, Plug Two, or just Dave — would pass away in 2023, mere weeks before their full catalog officially hit streaming platforms.Clipse slips from bad label deal to bad label dealFor Non-Editorial use please seek approval from Fashion House) No Malice and Pusha T of Clipse attend the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 18, 2024 in Paris, France.Photo by Julien M. Hekimian/Getty Images.Pusha T and Malice, better known as Clipse, have endured more false starts than a deaf track-and-field runner, thanks largely to label issues. After their original debut album,Exclusive Audio Footage, was shelved in 1999, they finally released their official debut,Lord Willin’, in 2002 through the Neptunes’ Star Trak Entertainment, under Arista Records. A label restructuring in 2004 shifted Clipse to Jive Records, while Star Trak moved under Interscope, effectively trapping the Thornton brothers in a music industry Phantom Zone. Four years afterLord Willin’— and following two critically acclaimedWe Got It 4 Cheapmixtapes — Clipse sued Jive and eventually negotiated a deal to release their long-delayed sophomore album,Hell Hath No Fury, through their own Re-Up Gang Records imprint in 2006. In 2007, they parted ways with Jive, signing a new deal with Columbia Records.Though Pusha T’s erstwhile rivalLil Waynehas been tied to Cash Money Records since his teenage years, he too has found himself entangled in the predatory practices of the music industry. In 2015, he sued Cash Money for a whopping $51 million, citing their refusal to release his albumTha Carter V, unpaid royalties, and control of his Young Money Entertainment (at that time the home to Drake and Nicki Minaj). Eventually, Wayne and Birdmanwould come to an agreement, andThe Carter Vwas finally released in 2018, seven years after its predecessor.Megan Thee Stallion and 1501 Certified EntertainmentMegan Thee Stallion performs at Coachella Stage during the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 20, 2025 in Indio, California.Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Coachella.The issues betweenMegan Thee Stallionand her former label, 1501 Certified Entertainment,are well-documented. In 2018, Megan signed with former baseball star Carl Crawford’s imprint, reportedly receiving a modest $10,000 advance — a figure considered well below industry standards. She later claimed the deal was a \"360 agreement,\" allowing the label to collect a share of her earnings beyond album sales, including revenue from live performances and merchandise. Tensions escalated when Megan sued 1501 Certified Entertainment, after the label disputed whether her 2021 releaseSomething for Thee Hottiesqualified as an official album under her contract. Meanwhile, the label’s actions reportedly stalled the release of her new music. After a years-long court battle, Megan and 1501agreed to a settlementin 2023, with Megan a few months later reaching a distribution deal with Warner Music to release music through her own imprint, Hot Girl Productions, while retaining complete ownership of her masters and publishing rights.Bad record deals seem more common than notThe members of N'Sync arrive at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center in Los Angeles, CA on February 21, 2001.Photo by Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.Across genres, exploitative contracts have ensnared some of music’s most iconic talents — many of whom may have remained unheard if not for their own outcry and the intervention of key industry power players. Before coming to prominence, Van Morrison found himself stuck in a record deal thatnearly derailed his burgeoning career.Billy Joel’sten-album deal with Family Productions in 1971was so deplorable that — thanks to signing away his publishing and recording rights — his debut albumCold Spring Harborwas marred by a mastering mistake that altered its sound, while Joel remained powerless to do anything until the late record executive Walter Yentikoff purchased his publishing rights and returned them to him. Taylor Swift famously released her “Taylor’s Version” re-recordings after her former label sold the masters of her first six albums to Scooter Braun for a reported $300 million. In 1999, *NSYNC sued both their former label, Trans Continental Records (later RCA Records), and manager Lou Pearlman for fraud and misrepresentation. Kesha was caught ina nearly decade-long legal war with her record label, Kemosabe Records, and Dr. Luke, the owner of the label, over her six-album contract. Kesha would also accuse Luke of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Both parties settled in 2023.As long as there are talented artists, there will always be those who will try to exploit their gifts for financial gain. In today’s music climate, artists are more than aware of the pitfalls of artist-unfriendly contracts and have more entrepreneurial opportunities than the previous generation of musicians. Despite this, however, powerful record labels and music corporationsstill have the meansto finesse artists out of their artistic livelihoods. When considering the record industry’s long track record of exploiting artists, the words of Prince remain true: “If you don’t own your masters,” Princesaid in 1996, “your master owns you.”\nWhile America was caught in the wave that was rock and roll music in the ‘50s, Black musicians were unsurprisingly gate-kept from and exploited by labels all too eager to profit off their blood, sweat, and melodies.

        "description": "It feels reductive to callMobb Deep’s greatest album a do-over, but that’s exactly what it was.\nPhoto of Mobb Deep.Photo by Des Willie/Redferns.Released on April 25, 1995,The Infamousreintroduced the Mobb as twin towers of Queensbridge terror — a duo that was more grizzled than juvenile. More ruthless than anything resembling remorseful. Spurred by Nas’Illmatic, the album saw Prodigy and Havoc abandon all traces of ambivalence on their way to developing a sound that was uncompromisingly menacing, yet human. Sonically and thematically, they gave into the darkness. And the darkness gave right back.Here, Hav and P present the danger of Queensbridge as an immutable force rather than a traffic cone that an after-school special — or a song like “Peer Pressure” — could enable you to avoid. Their piercing gaze was as unsparing as it was comprehensive. The opener, “The Start of Your Ending (41st Side),” is exactly what it sounds like, with Hav transmuting a sumptuous Dee Dee Warwick sample into something unholy; sentimental keyboard became eerily glum project buildings where inhabitants would shout at out-of-towners. Its source material is titled “Lovers Chant,” but in the hands of Prodigy and Havoc, it became a villain’s anthem. It’s a spiritual throughline for an album defined by either the beginning, ending, or aftermath of treachery.Havoc and Prodigy revel in that sort of wickedness for “Give Up the Goods (Just a Step),” a nocturnal, yet exhilarating track about robbery, drug dealing, and shooting first and leaving no questions. Produced by Q-Tip, who had actually discovered the Mobb a few years prior, the track breathed life into the thrill of the chase, the hustle and pre-emptive airstrikes.Mobb Deep during Mobb Deep Recording Session at Battery Studios in New York City, New York, United States.Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage.Harrowing and claustrophobic,The Infamousis just as much about physical threats as the psychological omnipresence of impending danger. It’s strewn across Hav production, seemingly designed for dreary days and pitch-black midnights. The bars give human form to these atmospheres where, in even the most innocent moments, tragedy is always around the corner. Exhibit A: “Trife Life.” Spinning across aqueous piano keys and spurts of foggy horns that ring through like theJawstheme, the two conjure two sides of separate romantic rendezvous: Prodigy makes preparations for a suspicious hook-up with a girl that might just turn a date night into a premature funeral. Meanwhile, Havoc is scheming on someone who’s just traveled to Queensbridge for their own date. Prodigy’s story is a tale of someone being paranoid; Havoc’s is evidence of why you have to be. At the end of the track, Hav laments this push-pull existence with blunt clarity:“Pulling the trigger when the drama appears / 'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear.”On tracks like “Eye for an Eye,” fear and anxiety morph into blood lust for retribution. Coasting over a beat that sounds like Havoc took his MPC for a vacation in a dungeon, he, Prodigy, Raekwon the Chef and Nas unspool a tapestry of violence and drug dealer lore. For his part, Nas, debuting his Nas Escobar persona, uses dense imagism to paint a portrait of the mania that accompanies life as a kingpin; or just a project dweller taking aim at forces too big for a bullet to destroy:“Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us / Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass / Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams.”Chanting over a tea kettle whistle that sounds like simmering despair, P affirms a cycle of murder and vengeance as eternal as nature:“As time goes by, an eye for an eye / We in this together, son, your beef is mine / So long as the sun shines to light up the sky / We in this together, son, your beef is mine.”If “Eye for an Eye” was made to soundtrack Rikers Island, “Shook Ones, Pt. II” was made forMad Max. It’s a track that turns a Herbie Hancock sample into a desolate wasteland where survival is the only law. Here, Prodigy blends sensory details with do-or-die determination for some of the most haunting — and frankly, gangsta — lyrics in American history:“Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation / If I die, I couldn't choose a better location / When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burning sensation / Getting closer to God in a tight situation.”As he notes himself, he was only 19 when he wrote those lyrics. Havoc was around the same age when he made the beat.While Prodigy will always be the more renowned member of Mobb Deep, the two are equal halves of a transcendent whole; fraternal creative twins with different, but similarly seismic gifts that defined an era of hip-hop. With more innovative sonic structures and more nuanced characterizations, they successfully transitioned from being talented juveniles to… well, the Infamous. Their coalescence rings off loudly on tracks like, “Shook Ones, Pt. II,” and really, the whole album. Perhaps never stronger than on “Survival of the Fittest.”A genius flip of Al Cohn and The Barry Harris Trio’s “Sky Lark,” the bassline is a prelude to something wicked. Layered with warped strings, the commencement encroaches like a tumbling, troubling realization, like the moment a monster steps forth from the darkness to swallow you whole. Lurking around the ominous, Havoc-produced instrumental, Prodigy lets loose a stark declaration of impending doom:“There’s a war going on outside, no one is safe from / You can run, but you can’t hide forever / From these streets that we done took — you walking with your head down scared to look.”But at this point, Hav and P weren’t scared to look: they saw the soul of Queensbridge and stared right through it.\nPhoto of Mobb Deep.\nPhoto by Des Willie/Redferns.\nReleased on April 25, 1995,The Infamousreintroduced the Mobb as twin towers of Queensbridge terror — a duo that was more grizzled than juvenile.

        "description": "Ari Lennoxis moving on from Dreamville.According toTMZ, the singer-songwriter is departingJ. Cole’slabel after a decade and has reportedly signed a new deal solely with Interscope. It comes on the heels of Lennox airing frustrations with her longtime label last year. In October, she posted a scathing criticism on X (formerly Twitter.)\n“Interscope and Dreamville have been playing with me all month,” she wrote. “I’m so tired of people acting like they’re sorry for me, as if I’m just the face of mental health. I’m okay—I’ve never been happier. What I don’t appreciate is being signed, lied to, and manipulated. No one at these labels knows how to market or protect me.”\n—  (@)Ari initially signed with Dreamville back in 2015. She dropped her major label debut, the EPPho, a year later and followed it with her first studio album,Shea Butter Baby, in 2019.Dreamville’s roster includes artists like ID, Bas, EARTHGANG, Cozz, Omen and Lute; and Ari Lennox performed atthe 2025 Dreamville Festival a few weeks ago. This year was billed as Cole’s Dreamville Fest’s final year. Cole said on the Raleigh, NC festival’s final night that something may emerge to take it’s place.\"We said this is the last Dreamville Festival,\" he said. \"I'm just keeping it 100 with y'all, that s--- be a lot.

Kendrick Lamar was tapped to be the halftime show performer, and now, Wayne says that he was no longer interested in the gig.“They stole that feeling.

        "title": "The ‘Last of Us’ Season 2 Premiere Recap: What Changed From the Game?",
        "description": "\"When we kill him, we kill him slowly.\" I didn’t expect to get hit with such an emotional gut punch just five minutes into the first episode, but here we are. Thanks to the selfish actions of Joel (yes, they were selfish! I don’t give a damn about his attachment to Ellie pushing him to “save” her), he’s made an enemy out of the ones closest to the “Fireflies” he killed. The one who enacted a plan to make Joel suffer as slowly and painfully as humanly possible is Abby. That opening moment was a hell of a start to the second season ofThe Last of Usand a series of episodes that I’m sure will cause a lot of jaws to drop from those of you who still haven’t played the second game. In my case, I completed the lengthy and incredibly depressing campaign that followed the revenge-fueled exploits of Ellie and Abby and am keen on picking out all the sequel’s moments that have been replicated onscreen in live-action form.\nI have to hand it to the set designers for this show – the snowy fort of Jackson, Wyoming that serves as the living quarters for Joel and Ellie looks just how I remember it. I shouldn’t have been surprised by how close to the source material it looked, considering an HBO budget backs this show, but I was still pleasantly surprised by how accurate that snowy residence looked. The majority of the first episode featured a host of occurrences that weren’t in the game, such as Ellie’s rough barnyard training regimen and Joel’s intense therapy session. I enjoyed the fact that those instances expanded upon the lore of the game and provided more background on Joel’s conflicted feelings about the unforgivable act he committed to retrieve Ellie, and Ellie growing into a more hardened survivor who can brave the dangers outside the safety of her new community.\nAs the episode wore on, two paramount sequences played out that harkened back to Ellie and Dina’s patrol and their passionate dance during the infamous “Jackson Party.” Before those events transpired, I got a kick out of watching Ellie tinker around with her firearms on the modding table in her home – that was a minor yet still noteworthy nod to how players upgrade their guns in the game. The rest of the scenes focused on Ellie’s time spent in her home was full of other Easter Eggs – Ellie’s signature acoustic guitar that’s marked by a butterfly symbol came into view, plus we got a good look at Ellie’s journal while she’s jotting down Dina’s \"bear-be-cue\" joke (journaling is a crucial component ofThe Last of Us Part II’sgameplay). I also spotted some posters on Ellie’s wall that made me mimic Leonardo DiCaprio's pointing meme, such as the one featuring Dr. Daniela Star, the protagonist who originated from the in-game collectible “Savage Starlight” comics and trading cards. The other poster that pays homage to the game is the one for the fictional band “Thoughts Twenty,” which also adorns Ellie’s in-game wall. The final Easter Egg that popped me (that’s wrestling lingo for getting a positive reaction out of me, folks!) was the switchblade Ellie pulls out of her table as she heads out the door. That’s the same spot where she retrieves her beloved knife in the game!Once Ellie and Dina hopped on their horses and exited the safety of Jackson to go on patrol, one of the game’s most critical moments began to play out. Instead of following a blood trail to the mutilated corpse of a moose, the show opted to go with a bear that was torn to shreds instead. What followed next was a big changeup from the way Ellie and Dina continued their mission in the game – instead of hopping through the first floor window of a supermarket brimming with the “Infected,” they ascended to the second floor of the building to kick off their meeting with a pair of “Clickers.” After Ellie’s impressive sneaking and knife-wielding skills put one of them down for good, she fell through the roof above the supermarket’s lower sanctum. In the game, Ellie and Dina end up crashing together below and quickly spring into action while aisles full of Clickers wander about. The show switches things up by having Ellie contend with a sole “Stalker” during a stressful encounter that ended with Ellie getting bit while she put a few bullets into her twisted adversary.The closing segment of this show stood out as the main scene that was closest to the way it happened in the game. And what made it even more significant is the fact that it occurred in time with what was taking place during the episode instead of being used as a flashback sequence. The scene I’m referring to is the Jackson Party, of course – Ellie awkwardly standing by her lonesome, her lighthearted conversation with Jesse, the impassioned kiss shared between her and Dina, the angry onlooker that voiced his disapproval of their behavior, and Joel shoving the man who disturbed them to the ground were all replicated to perfection, frame-by-frame. Even though I knew it was coming, hearing Ellie angrily tell Joel she doesn’t need his help still hit me like a ton of bricks.I’m satisfied thus far with how this show has producedThe Last of Us Part II’smost unforgettable moments. And with the added plot wrinkles of cordyceps tendrils infecting the town’s water supply since it’s seen stuck inside a central pipe, and Abby’s group finally finding the town that houses her sworn enemy Joel, I’m sure the rest of the second season will introduce more moments not included in the game that adds more background to its established lore.\nAs the episode wore on, two paramount sequences played out that harkened back to Ellie and Dina’s patrol and their passionate dance during the infamous “Jackson Party.” Before those events transpired, I got a kick out of watching Ellie tinker around with her firearms on the modding table in her home – that was a minor yet still noteworthy nod to how players upgrade their guns in the game.

        "description": "Megan Thee Stalliondelivered a star-studded set at Coachella — even in spite of a technical issue during her performance. The rap superstar hit the stage in the desert and proceeded to shut things down with a little help from her friends: namelyCiara,Victoria MonetandQueen Latifah.\nLatifah emerged during Meg’s performance of “Plan B,” and the song turned into a mashup with the Queen’s classic “U.N.I.T.Y.” Victoria Monet joined Megan for a steamy performance of their 2024 collab “Spin,” complete with a lap dance. And Ciara came out and crushed her performance of “Goodies” before teaming with Meg for “Roc Steady.”\nAccording toRolling Stone, Meg ran into some microphone issues during her performance but didn’t miss a beat. The high energy and theme of sisterhood drowned out any tech problems — even when the rap superstar was forced to cut things slightly for time.Speaking of sisterhood, Megrecently revealed that she’s eager to work with Doechii— revealing that the Florida native would be a dream collaboration.“I do want to do a song with Doechii,” she said in March. “That’s on my list. That’s on my album wish list.”“I feel like Doechii would be the type of person that you would have to be in the studio to make a song with. I would like to hear a beat that she would like to rap over, and also I’m, like, challenging myself to rap over beats that I wouldn’t normally rap over without losing myself.”Back in February, Queen Latifah participated in a salute to Quincy Jones at the Annual Academy Awards. Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah introduced the tribute, which encompassed dancers, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Latifah performing “Ease on Down the Road” fromThe Wiz. Jones supervised the adaptation of songs for the film.\nAccording toRolling Stone, Meg ran into some microphone issues during her performance but didn’t miss a beat.

And R&B and hip-hop acts have given some of the most historically revered and memorable of those performances. Legends like De La Soul, Redman and Method Man, and Pusha T have all taken the stage in the desert, and the headliners have been among the greatest in urban music. Here’s a look at the headliners who have helped define the Coachella experience.\nJay-Z - 2010Jay-Z performs during Day 1 of the Coachella Valley Music & Art Festival 2010 held at the Empire Polo Club on April 16, 2010 in Indio, California.Photo by John Shearer/WireImage.Jay-Z was still in the midst ofhis campaign forThe Blueprint 3when he was announced as a Coachella headliner and Hov made the desert stage his own back in 2010, delivering scale and spectacle — and a stellar guest appearance from Mrs. Carter — as the day one headliner. Armed with a litany of hits (from “Takeover” and “P.S.A.” to an encore that included “Big Pimpin’” and, yes, “Encore”) and an Obama cameo on the background screen, the festival got Jay-Z at the peak of his influence and impact.Dr. Dre and Snoop - 2012Snoop Dogg (L) and a hologram of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur perform onstage during day 3 of the 2012 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Field on April 15, 2012 in Indio, CaliforniaPhoto by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella.Special guests had become a hallmark of Coachella headlining performances, and Dr. Dre himself had been a rumored surprise guest during Jay’s 2010 Coachella appearance.

OutKast had briefly reunited for a tour in celebration ofthe 20-year anniversary of their debut album, and Coachella was the barometer for how the veterans were expected to do on the road. The performance itself was famously awkward, with the reclusive Andre 3000 seeming detached and disaffected. But the duo got it together for their second appearance, acknowledging the flawed first set and showing they still had the goods.Drake - 2015Drake performs during the 2015 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival at The Empire Polo Club on April 12, 2015 in Indio, California.Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/WireImage.The megastar closed out Coachella’s first weekend back in 2015 and delivered his novel combo of fizzy pop appeal and rap swagger. Keeping the performance decidedly emo, against a backdrop of somber rain, he ran through his then-catalog standouts including “6 God” and “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” However, Drake’s set is perhaps most known for the scene-stealing guest appearance from none other than Madonna, where the Material Girlfamously kissed Drizzyduring their performance, prompting a wave of Twitter reactions.Ice Cube’s NWA Reunion - 2016(L-R) Members of N.W.A.

Combining his stellar catalog withan impressive visual display, it was the kind of performance that embodied what Tyler has become known for: controlled craft and unbridled creativity. Doja Cat closed the festival with a set that was just as visually engaging and arresting, performing with everything from dancing yetis to a dinosaur skeleton. She also decided to delve deeper into her catalog, as opposed to delivering the big shiny hits, resulting in a set that was fiercely individualistic yet still very crowd-pleasing.Tyler, the Creator performs at the Coachella Stage during the 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival at Empire Polo Club on April 20, 2024 in Indio, California.Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Coachella.\nJay-Z performs during Day 1 of the Coachella Valley Music & Art Festival 2010 held at the Empire Polo Club on April 16, 2010 in Indio, California.\nPhoto by John Shearer/WireImage.\nJay-Z was still in the midst ofhis campaign forThe Blueprint 3when he was announced as a Coachella headliner and Hov made the desert stage his own back in 2010, delivering scale and spectacle — and a stellar guest appearance from Mrs. Carter — as the day one headliner.

OutKast had briefly reunited for a tour in celebration ofthe 20-year anniversary of their debut album, and Coachella was the barometer for how the veterans were expected to do on the road. The performance itself was famously awkward, with the reclusive Andre 3000 seeming detached and disaffected.

Keeping the performance decidedly emo, against a backdrop of somber rain, he ran through his then-catalog standouts including “6 God” and “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” However, Drake’s set is perhaps most known for the scene-stealing guest appearance from none other than Madonna, where the Material Girlfamously kissed Drizzyduring their performance, prompting a wave of Twitter reactions.\n(L-R) Members of N.W.A.

        "title": "10 TikTok Instrumentalists & Producers You Should Follow Right Now",
        "description": "Editor's Note: This post was originally published in April 2022 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.\nTikTok is the perfect platform for producers. No app gives as much curated space for them to add visual elements to their process. Though the platform made it possible for videos to go up toten minutes in length,the short form (as it was originally intended for the algorithm) makes it so producers can present their craft as a compelling, quick performance. The necessary zoom-in feel of the videos makes it so you’re able to get a more in-depth look at how sounds are made than at a live show.\nBeyond fully-fledged composers, single instrumentalists also get to shine on the app. Guitarists, cellists, pianists, finger drummers, and more can utilize theduet featureto collaborate with as wide a range of other instrumentalists and vocalists as the app's reach will allow. A space that initially seemed to cater to dance crazes and bts videos of literally anyone's life or opinions has now become an avenue to expose true musical craftsmanship.\nThe range of different producers and instrumentalists on TikTok is incredibly vast — from popular super-producers likeJack Antonoffto the growing followings of producer tutorialists likesowylie.That said, we’ve taken the time to highlight ten of the most compelling we’ve been able to find onour TikTok.\nApril Kae (@aprilkae.nyc)@aprilkae_had to do it >>> ftcu ✨ deftones x nicki minaj ftcu guitar is the best guitar, but is ftcu deftones the best ftcu? #ftcu #guitar #nickiminaj #deftones #gagcity #myownsummer #electricguitar #bassguitar #ftcudeftonesApril Kae, a New York City-based bassist, flaunts impeccable skill in rhythm, range,and making videos that make you smile wide. Her bass playing spans all genres including (but not limited to) funk, punk, hip-hop, and even '90s pop girl groups. Kae also utilizes her platform to promote feminism, body positivity and music education.Ken James Kubota (@kenjameskubota)@kenjameskubotaHave any melody ideas? #cello #cellist #guitar #bass #riffHave you ever seen someone play the cello like an acoustic guitar? On TikTok,Ken James Kubotais skillfully expanding the range of the instrument. His R&B centered plucked sequences grab your ear immediately as you hear them.

Whether he’s composing multi-part instrumentals or just seeing how he cansample pouring waterout of a water bottle and put it on top of drums and synths, his content is always worth a watch and listen.Steph Strings (@stephstringsmusic)@stephstringsmusicBTS recording my debut album 🎧 #fyp #musician #artistWhile this Australian musician also does sing and write songs, some of Steph Strings’ most captivating videos come from her just being alone with one of her many instruments.

        "description": "Dreamville Festival2025 was less of a music festival and more of a family reunion. The kind where the grill's hot, cousins you haven't seen in years pull up in their best fits, and the soundtrack is nothing but classics and new heat alike. Set against the pristine backdrop of perfect spring weather in Raleigh, North Carolina, the two-day celebration brought together roughly 100,000 cumulative fans for a weekend that felt as joyous and spacious as your auntie's backyard on the 4th of July.\nSee on Instagram\nThe unmatched aura from Erykah Badu has no boundaries. She reminded everyone why she is the Godmother of Soul at Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, North Carolina for Dreamville Fest on April 6, 2025.\nPhoto by Kaushik Kalidindi for Okayplayer.\nOne of the most beautiful things about Dreamville Fest is the way it doesn't just highlight music, it centers community. All throughout Dorothea Dix Park, you felt it. Dreamville merch from past festival installments and Dreamville jerseys — basketball and baseball alike — were scattered across the festival grounds. From the local food vendors giving out generous plates, to the fans dancing barefoot in the grass, to the playful moments in branded activations spread throughout, the vibe was a love-forward display of Black joy in motion: sunny, effortless and healing.\nLudacris rolls through timeless hits of his 25 year catalog at Dreamville Fest at Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 5, 2025.\nPhoto by Kaushik Kalidindi for Okayplayer.\nTunechi knows how to put on a performance for the people.

GloRilla’s set had an electric, raw energy that had the crowd moving in unison — like she’d been a Dreamville staple for years. Having one of the biggest crowds of the weekend, she had every attendee in the palm of her hand. EARTHGANG brought everyone together with an animated, unpredictable set that felt like organized chaos in the best way. There was the ethereal presence of Tems, gracious in all her moments with enchanting vocals that can be heard clearly across the park. And then there was nothing like Erykah Badu, effortlessly reminding everyone that there is no replacing a soul who moves in their own orbit.\nEarthGang put on for the city of Atlanta for Dreamville Fest 2025.

Coleclosing the festival. Welcomed like a hometown hero, Cole’s presence on stage was calm, confident and deeply emotional. You could tell he was grateful not just for the turnout, but for what the festival has become: a space where music, family and culture meet with no pretense. The embrace he shared with Badu, when she joined him for hisFriday Night Lightsopener “Too Deep for the Intro” (which sampled Badu’s ownMama’s Gunclassic, “Didn't Cha Know\"), felt like a moment in time that the crowd would never forget.\nSee on Instagram\nCole World, no blanket. J. Cole knew exactly how to close out the final Dreamville Fest in his city. He performed timeless hits from his entire catalogue at Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 6, 2025.\nDreamville Festival 2025 was more than a show — it was a reminder of how powerful Black creativity can be when it’s nurtured and celebrated. It’s not just about who’s on stage. It’s about who’s in the crowd, who’s next up, and who’s coming back next year.\nThis didn’t feel like a one-off event; it felt like tradition. While this is the last of Dreamville Festival in its current iteration, J. Cole announced this would not be the end of this annual celebration.\nPhoto by Kaushik Kalidindi for Okayplayer.\nBigXThaPlug performs on stage at Dreamville Festival at Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 6, 2025.",

        "description": "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangerswas a phenomenon in the 1990s, and the popularity of the series made it a hugely successful cultural and commercial franchise. The show debuted on FOX Kids in 1993 and became a massive hit with young viewers, especially. But one of the writers behind the show’s success recently admitted that he had regrets about the awkward casting: namely, the choice to have a Black man to play the team’s Black Ranger, and an Asian woman to play the Yellow Ranger.\n\"None of us are thinking stereotypes,\" he said in the “Dark Side of the Power Rangers” episode of the series. He also said he never noticed the problematic casting choices until his assistant “pointed it out in a meeting one day.”“Nobody really talked about me playing the Black Ranger at first,” Black Ranger actor Walter Emanuel Jonessaid in a 2014 interview.“But after Trang was hired, everyone was like ‘Wait a minute! The Yellow Ranger is Asian and you’re the Black Ranger and you’re a Black guy.’ They were going to replace Audri Dubois with another girl either way, but she just happened to be Asian.”The popularity of the show has led to video games, popular movies, and even a “Hip-Hop Rangers” team that appeared on the show briefly during its run.\n\"None of us are thinking stereotypes,\" he said in the “Dark Side of the Power Rangers” episode of the series.

        "description": "April has already gotten off to a hot start (be sure to check out Boldy James and V-Don’sAlphabet Highway), but there are some very cool album releases happening throughout the month. TheWuis back with their highly-anticipated album,Black Samson; andWiz Khalifafinally blesses us withKush & OJ II. In R&B, we get a new project from soul star Ledisi, and Coco Jones also delivers her debut this month.\nHere are some of the albums we are looking forward to this month.\nWU-TANG AND MATHEMATICS - ‘BLACK SAMSON, THE BASTARD SWORDSMAN’ (April 12)The Shaolin swordsmen are releasing their first album in seven years, and their second under the abbreviated “Wu-Tang” moniker (sans the “Clan”). It’s the follow up to The Saga Continues, a project that was billed as a compilation because of U-God’s absence. This time around, producer Mathematics has recruited the entire clan.DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN & THEGOODNEWS – ‘THIS JUST IN’ (April 12)The alt-rap icon Del and his new, primarily animated group thegoodnews have been priming fans for their new EP. Also cool: they’re releasing the new project as an official Record Store Day exclusive on limited-edition picture-disc vinyl.WIZ KHALIFA - ‘KUSH & ORANGE JUICE II’ (April 18)The follow up to arguably his most beloved release,Kush and OJ IIis a project meant to tap into the fan-driven enthusiasm of the mixtape era — and it features no shortage of high profile producers; from DJ Quik to Lex Luger and Mike WiLL Made-It.DAVIDO - ‘5IVE’ (April 18)The Afrobeats superstar returns with his appropriately titled fifth album. After the success of his 2023 album,Timeless, anticipation is understandably high for the new project from the five-time Grammy nominee. He’s already dropped “Be There Still,” and a collaboration with Victony and Musa Keys.BLU & AUGUST FANON - ‘FORTY’ (April 18)Blu announced his new album last month, revealing that the project is entirely produced by August Fanon. The introspective rhymer’s fanbase couldn’t be more excited, and the physical album comes in limited edition, gold and splatter vinyl and also features a 40th birthday invitation insert signed by both Blu and August.KOOL KEITH - ‘KARPENTERS’ (April 18)Hip-hop’s weirdest lyricist is back. The man dubbed “Black Elvis,” “Dr. Octagon,” etc, teams up with Grant Shapiro for this latest release — a back-to-basics embrace of classic hip-hop. And in the run-up to the album dropping, Keith has released the single “Super Hits.”RODDY RICH - ‘THE NAVY ALBUM’ (April 25)After some delays — it was expected last fall, then pushed to February, the West Coast star’s third album is finally due to drop. He’s already released “Survivors Remorse,” as well as “Lonely Road” — with production from Turbo and Terrace Martin.COCO JONES - ‘WHY NOT MORE?’ (April 25)The sultry R&B star is ready for her close up. After whetting the public’s appetite with a few smoldering singles, including her Grammy-nominated hit “Here We Go (Uh Oh)”, Coco’s debut studio album finally arrives. Her debut comes three years after her acclaimed EP,What I Didn’t Tell You.LEDISI - ‘THE CROWN’ (April 25)She’s long been one of souls most powerful voices and most consistent artists. Ledisi returns with her twelfth album. The singer-songwriter has already released the track “Love You Too,” and she’s hitting the road with fellow songstress Marsha Ambrosius in May.\n\nThe Shaolin swordsmen are releasing their first album in seven years, and their second under the abbreviated “Wu-Tang” moniker (sans the “Clan”).

        "title": "10 New Orleans Rappers You Need To Listen To",
        "description": "Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2021 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.\nNew Orleans has always been a city of rebirth. Regardless of the litany of forces keeping the Crescent City down — whether it's the ever-present effects of Hurricane Katrina from the past, a steady flow of failing politicians in the present, or the impending devastation of hurricanes and global warming in the future — the people of New Orleans will rebuild with music and passion fueling their effort.The New Orleans rap scene is trying to rebuild, also. After a legendary stretch in the '90s and early aughts, the city’s rap scene has been in a recession. A dearth of local support and proper infrastructure has limited growth from young talent, and anyone who manages to reach a modicum of success quickly becomes a likely target of violence or incarceration.Young GreatnessandBTY YoungNwere the latest New Orleans rappers to break through the concrete ceiling and find national prominence, only to be gunned down in their hometown before reaching their full potential. It's an unfortunate trend that’s been a long chapter in New Orleans’ rap history.Injections of fame from outside sources don’t help, either. Drake sampling a bounce beat andmimicking(albeit poorly) a New Orleans accent — or rappers from outside thearea appropriatingthe soundfor personalgain — hasn’t benefited the local scene one bit.But don’t let the despairing realities of the scene fool you; New Orleans is brimming with talent.glbl wrmng vol 1. —a conceptual album, headed by rapper Pell, meant to empower the scene and its participants — showcased an array of skilled rappers hidden away in New Orleans. Still, it's been too long since the city that gave the world No Limit and Cash Money produced a homegrown star; it's time that changes.The burgeoning scene along the Mighty Mississippi needs your ears now more than ever. Here are 10 New Orleans rappers you need to hear.Stone Cold JzzleLil Waynetwice said, “Repetition is the father of learning.” Stone Cold Jzzle must have taken that advice to heart, making overly repetitive choruses his trademark. The 7th Ward rapper uses only one word or phrase and repeats it in rapid succession until it’s lodged in your brain. After a listen or two, he already has you hooked.That distinctive quirk is how “YUP” became a pre-pandemic hit with enough juice to give Jzzle his first taste of national spotlight. Since that spark, he’s continued to show off his fun-natured spirit, letting his silver-grilled smile shine as he Griddys across his videos.With unmistakable charisma, a specific ear for hard-hitting beats with flickering synths, and the backing of local creative collective FreeWater, it’s easy to see how he earnedG Herbo’s co-signand an impromptu freestyling sessionwith A$AP Rocky.Tatyanna XLMaybe it’s the water in New Orleans’ 3rd Ward. Jay Electronica, Soulja Slim, and Juvenile are just some of the decorated stars to come from the neighborhood. And now, Tatyanna XL is the most recent product making noise.It doesn’t matter that Tatyanna XL is relatively new to rapping — her first project,Proper Preparation, was released last December — she still attacks the mic with the swagger and confidence of a lifelong spitter.Much like her legendary predecessors, Tatyanna demands attention as soon as she breathes on the track. Her bars don’t just growl — they bite with fierce intention. “No motherfuckin’ cappin’ in my rapping, Im’a stepper/ nigga wanna beef, then Im’a stuff ‘em like a pepper,” she viciously raps on“Wateva TF Freestyle,\"a cut from her latest tape.Tatyanna takes it a little easier on “Love Song,” an emotional breakup ballad behind a Slum Village instrumental, but her in-your-face delivery is still evident.Lil IcebergIn the effort to rebuild the local rap scene to mainstream hype, staying true to New Orleans is essential. While various sounds coming from the area are beneficial, a rapper who can bring the classic 504 sound to 2021 is vital to the culture. Enter Lil Iceberg — aka B Money, aka Ice Biggity — a NOLA purist preserving the legendary sound Mannie Fresh and others birthed in the city’s golden age of rap.His influences couldn’t be more evident on“Big Ballin’ Freestyle,”where he updates the classicBig Tymers instrumentalwith some current-day New Orleans flare. You can still catch a glimpse of the rags-to-riches lyrical content the Hot Boyz used in Iceberg's rhymes:“Remember I ain't have no cable / Now I want to cop a plantation, beaucoup acres, big farm, and horse stable.”But Iceberg isn’t just tethered to the past. Tracks like “Big Shot” and“Say When”prove he can flow over contemporary rap production while still letting his homegrown sound shine through.Rob49New Orleans’ city streets have always been riddled with potholes deep enough to swallow a bumper or two. Then a young 19-year-old with a thunderous voice and natural skill from the 4th Ward stumbled into the booth. Someone made the mistake of giving him ground-shaking bass and stabbing snares to work with, and now New Orleans looks like the surface of the moon.That young 19-year-old beating up historic city streets is Rob49, a phenom who has only been rapping professionally for a year but is still taking the city by storm. His lyrics about the trials, tribulations, and riches of street life have catapulted him to the top of the New Orleans rap scene. The exciting buzz surrounding him has even made its way to Cash Money CEO Birdman.It's hard to ignore Rob49,whodroppedthreeprojectsin afive-month span last year. He looks and feels like a star in the making, and he’s already garnered massive support inside New Orleans’ borders.WeedJunkyCurren$y tooksome time onNoreaga’sDrink Champspodcast to shout out some New Orleans rappers that he admires. As soon as he mentioned WeedJunky, Spitta added, “I wish he’d change his name.” One thing WeedJunky doesn’t have to change is his approach.Junky — who also happens to be the son of Grammy-award-winning trumpeterNicholas Payton— is heavily influenced by Lil Wayne’s work ethic and affinity for remixing popular songs. WeedJunky applied that borrowed mentality and earned himself a massive 2019. A year of high output and quality remixes over instrumentals of various highbrow street artists, like Young Thug’s“The London''and Lil Durk’s“Neighborhood Hero,” solidified Junky as one of the hottest rappers in New Orleans. Junky is a submachine gun on the mic, spraying any beat he sees with quick-witted punchlines until it’s left perforated and smoking.With those lyrical and mental capabilities, WeedJunky has everything it takes to explode out of the city; even his name can’t stop that. And if he’ll take Spitta’s advice on the name change? Junky raps his answer on“Game From Weezy:”“Spitta said change my name? I’m thinking not ever.”$leazy EzAfter winning $500 at a contest at the House of Blues in the French Quarter, $leazy Ez built herself a home recording studio at 17 years old. The Westbank rapper has leveraged that initial win to create a unique sound emanating from New Orleans.There’s a dash of California sunshine with $leazy’s alternative NOLA sound, which explains why some of her biggest influences are Snoop Dogg and Suga Free. Sonically, your vibe is in her hands. She can rap you onto a sofa and mellow you out with tracks like“Siamese.”Or, she can turn up whatever function you may have planned for the night with“ADHD.”$leazy prides herself on being versatile and is quick to cut herself out of any box meant to define her.Chad Conquering Lion“Same nigga came up to the Hermes from Dada,”Chad Conquering Lion raps on his newest cut, “New Money.” His come-up really is remarkable. The longtime rapper has been putting out quality music in the New Orleans underground circuit since2009, and that long resume of work has made him one of the city’s most respected lyricists.It’s not just seniority that gives Chad so much weight in New Orleans; his technical skill is noteworthy. A true style bender behind the beat, the Hollygrove spitter delivers an effortless flow of crafty similes and clever wordplay filled with cultural references.“Eyes low, sleepwalking, Donnie Darko / My name is my name like The Wire, and it’s Marlo,”he raps on“Venting,”a three-minute banana clip full of quotables that’ll make you pause and ponder.Jameel Na’im XJameel Na’im X is an eye-opener. Not from a brash musical style meant to slap you in the face, but with smooth soul samples and an innate ability to paint vivid pictures with his slick rhymes, and unmitigated cool.JNX also happens to be one of the most consistent rappers in New Orleans. The Eastside artist doesn’t miss, whether it’s a quick-paced flow on“Ratchet AF,”or slower stoic delivery on“No More Idols.”His latest project,2 Birds 1 Stone, is filled with more bullseyes than a dart board at an Irish bar.His composed and intelligent street raps could be a familiar voice onJ. Cole’s Dreamville, or alongsideBenny the Butcher andthe Griselda team. But JNX is likely happy where he is, being a consistent force for O.T.B Ent. and putting New Orleans on his back.504IcyGirl504IcyGirl is a rare concoction of sugary trap flavors bubbling over a tall New Orleans gumbo pot. Although the self-described “Trap Princess” recently relocated to Los Angeles, she’s still heavily repping her hometown with “504” tatted on her neck and attached to her name.Light-hearted synths and heavy bass are all 504IcyGirl needs to get started. “Totin'” shows the Westbank rapper in her sweet spot, filling the hard-knocking beat with mounds of traditional trap fare.“Can’t show my toolie out in public cause it’s stolen,”she admits while also showing her toolie in public. But on“Rockin Out,”504IcyGirl flips the menacingly bleakHot Boyz “Ridin’” instrumental with her technicolored hardcore steez.It’s hard not to hear a touch ofTales of Taco Bella-eraRico Nastyin IcyGirl’s style, but a heavy dose of New Orleans vernacular. Maybe her move to Los Angeles will facilitate a quicker rise. It’ll be fun seeing what the 504IcyGirl can do with a plethora of resources at her disposal.Kenneth BrotherKenneth Brother’s name was inspired by tragedy. His best friend, Kenneth, passed only hours after the Westbank rapper played his final high school football game — a loss in the state championship. A devastating injury in college derailed his NFL dreams, which led him to pick up music and the moniker Kenneth Brother. Now, it’s hard not to know Kenneth’s name in New Orleans.KB has established himself as the city’s resident inspirational speaker. The Algiers rapper’s encouraging lyrics can fuel you to put in extra hours on that project you’ve been working on or to only kick down one more door before quitting the game for good. But what matters most to Kenneth Brother is loyalty and positive energy.“And them 4Ls aint for life, before you bro’ ‘em, gotta read 'em,”he advises on“4L”behind pitched-down bells. But don’t get it confused, KB has an aggressive side to him also, one quick to throw a middle finger towards any opponents of his hustle or his close-knit crew. He doesn’t need to make murder threats in his raps to make that point.KB’s fan base has only grown as he continues to carry Kenneth’s legacy through music.__Nigel Washingtonis a freelance music, culture, and sports writer from New Orleans, Louisiana. He scrolls and tweets endlessly as @Tribecalledni on all platforms\nNew Orleans has always been a city of rebirth. Regardless of the litany of forces keeping the Crescent City down — whether it's the ever-present effects of Hurricane Katrina from the past, a steady flow of failing politicians in the present, or the impending devastation of hurricanes and global warming in the future — the people of New Orleans will rebuild with music and passion fueling their effort.\nThe New Orleans rap scene is trying to rebuild, also. After a legendary stretch in the '90s and early aughts, the city’s rap scene has been in a recession. A dearth of local support and proper infrastructure has limited growth from young talent, and anyone who manages to reach a modicum of success quickly becomes a likely target of violence or incarceration.Young GreatnessandBTY YoungNwere the latest New Orleans rappers to break through the concrete ceiling and find national prominence, only to be gunned down in their hometown before reaching their full potential. It's an unfortunate trend that’s been a long chapter in New Orleans’ rap history.\nInjections of fame from outside sources don’t help, either. Drake sampling a bounce beat andmimicking(albeit poorly) a New Orleans accent — or rappers from outside thearea appropriatingthe soundfor personalgain — hasn’t benefited the local scene one bit.\nBut don’t let the despairing realities of the scene fool you; New Orleans is brimming with talent.glbl wrmng vol 1. —a conceptual album, headed by rapper Pell, meant to empower the scene and its participants — showcased an array of skilled rappers hidden away in New Orleans. Still, it's been too long since the city that gave the world No Limit and Cash Money produced a homegrown star; it's time that changes.\nThe burgeoning scene along the Mighty Mississippi needs your ears now more than ever. Here are 10 New Orleans rappers you need to hear.\n\nLil Waynetwice said, “Repetition is the father of learning.” Stone Cold Jzzle must have taken that advice to heart, making overly repetitive choruses his trademark. The 7th Ward rapper uses only one word or phrase and repeats it in rapid succession until it’s lodged in your brain. After a listen or two, he already has you hooked.\nThat distinctive quirk is how “YUP” became a pre-pandemic hit with enough juice to give Jzzle his first taste of national spotlight. Since that spark, he’s continued to show off his fun-natured spirit, letting his silver-grilled smile shine as he Griddys across his videos.\nWith unmistakable charisma, a specific ear for hard-hitting beats with flickering synths, and the backing of local creative collective FreeWater, it’s easy to see how he earnedG Herbo’s co-signand an impromptu freestyling sessionwith A$AP Rocky.\n\nMaybe it’s the water in New Orleans’ 3rd Ward. Jay Electronica, Soulja Slim, and Juvenile are just some of the decorated stars to come from the neighborhood. And now, Tatyanna XL is the most recent product making noise.\nIt doesn’t matter that Tatyanna XL is relatively new to rapping — her first project,Proper Preparation, was released last December — she still attacks the mic with the swagger and confidence of a lifelong spitter.\nMuch like her legendary predecessors, Tatyanna demands attention as soon as she breathes on the track. Her bars don’t just growl — they bite with fierce intention. “No motherfuckin’ cappin’ in my rapping, Im’a stepper/ nigga wanna beef, then Im’a stuff ‘em like a pepper,” she viciously raps on“Wateva TF Freestyle,\"a cut from her latest tape.\nTatyanna takes it a little easier on “Love Song,” an emotional breakup ballad behind a Slum Village instrumental, but her in-your-face delivery is still evident.\n\nIn the effort to rebuild the local rap scene to mainstream hype, staying true to New Orleans is essential. While various sounds coming from the area are beneficial, a rapper who can bring the classic 504 sound to 2021 is vital to the culture. Enter Lil Iceberg — aka B Money, aka Ice Biggity — a NOLA purist preserving the legendary sound Mannie Fresh and others birthed in the city’s golden age of rap.\nHis influences couldn’t be more evident on“Big Ballin’ Freestyle,”where he updates the classicBig Tymers instrumentalwith some current-day New Orleans flare. You can still catch a glimpse of the rags-to-riches lyrical content the Hot Boyz used in Iceberg's rhymes:“Remember I ain't have no cable / Now I want to cop a plantation, beaucoup acres, big farm, and horse stable.”\nBut Iceberg isn’t just tethered to the past. Tracks like “Big Shot” and“Say When”prove he can flow over contemporary rap production while still letting his homegrown sound shine through.\n\nNew Orleans’ city streets have always been riddled with potholes deep enough to swallow a bumper or two. Then a young 19-year-old with a thunderous voice and natural skill from the 4th Ward stumbled into the booth. Someone made the mistake of giving him ground-shaking bass and stabbing snares to work with, and now New Orleans looks like the surface of the moon.\nThat young 19-year-old beating up historic city streets is Rob49, a phenom who has only been rapping professionally for a year but is still taking the city by storm. His lyrics about the trials, tribulations, and riches of street life have catapulted him to the top of the New Orleans rap scene. The exciting buzz surrounding him has even made its way to Cash Money CEO Birdman.\nIt's hard to ignore Rob49,whodroppedthreeprojectsin afive-month span last year. He looks and feels like a star in the making, and he’s already garnered massive support inside New Orleans’ borders.\n\nCurren$y tooksome time onNoreaga’sDrink Champspodcast to shout out some New Orleans rappers that he admires. As soon as he mentioned WeedJunky, Spitta added, “I wish he’d change his name.” One thing WeedJunky doesn’t have to change is his approach.\nJunky — who also happens to be the son of Grammy-award-winning trumpeterNicholas Payton— is heavily influenced by Lil Wayne’s work ethic and affinity for remixing popular songs. WeedJunky applied that borrowed mentality and earned himself a massive 2019. A year of high output and quality remixes over instrumentals of various highbrow street artists, like Young Thug’s“The London''and Lil Durk’s“Neighborhood Hero,” solidified Junky as one of the hottest rappers in New Orleans. Junky is a submachine gun on the mic, spraying any beat he sees with quick-witted punchlines until it’s left perforated and smoking.\nWith those lyrical and mental capabilities, WeedJunky has everything it takes to explode out of the city; even his name can’t stop that. And if he’ll take Spitta’s advice on the name change? Junky raps his answer on“Game From Weezy:”“Spitta said change my name? I’m thinking not ever.”\nAfter winning $500 at a contest at the House of Blues in the French Quarter, $leazy Ez built herself a home recording studio at 17 years old. The Westbank rapper has leveraged that initial win to create a unique sound emanating from New Orleans.\nThere’s a dash of California sunshine with $leazy’s alternative NOLA sound, which explains why some of her biggest influences are Snoop Dogg and Suga Free. Sonically, your vibe is in her hands. She can rap you onto a sofa and mellow you out with tracks like“Siamese.”Or, she can turn up whatever function you may have planned for the night with“ADHD.”\n$leazy prides herself on being versatile and is quick to cut herself out of any box meant to define her.\n\n“Same nigga came up to the Hermes from Dada,”Chad Conquering Lion raps on his newest cut, “New Money.” His come-up really is remarkable. The longtime rapper has been putting out quality music in the New Orleans underground circuit since2009, and that long resume of work has made him one of the city’s most respected lyricists.\nIt’s not just seniority that gives Chad so much weight in New Orleans; his technical skill is noteworthy. A true style bender behind the beat, the Hollygrove spitter delivers an effortless flow of crafty similes and clever wordplay filled with cultural references.“Eyes low, sleepwalking, Donnie Darko / My name is my name like The Wire, and it’s Marlo,”he raps on“Venting,”a three-minute banana clip full of quotables that’ll make you pause and ponder.\n\nJameel Na’im X is an eye-opener. Not from a brash musical style meant to slap you in the face, but with smooth soul samples and an innate ability to paint vivid pictures with his slick rhymes, and unmitigated cool.\nJNX also happens to be one of the most consistent rappers in New Orleans. The Eastside artist doesn’t miss, whether it’s a quick-paced flow on“Ratchet AF,”or slower stoic delivery on“No More Idols.”His latest project,2 Birds 1 Stone, is filled with more bullseyes than a dart board at an Irish bar.\nHis composed and intelligent street raps could be a familiar voice onJ. Cole’s Dreamville, or alongsideBenny the Butcher andthe Griselda team. But JNX is likely happy where he is, being a consistent force for O.T.B Ent. and putting New Orleans on his back.\n\n504IcyGirl is a rare concoction of sugary trap flavors bubbling over a tall New Orleans gumbo pot. Although the self-described “Trap Princess” recently relocated to Los Angeles, she’s still heavily repping her hometown with “504” tatted on her neck and attached to her name.\nLight-hearted synths and heavy bass are all 504IcyGirl needs to get started. “Totin'” shows the Westbank rapper in her sweet spot, filling the hard-knocking beat with mounds of traditional trap fare.“Can’t show my toolie out in public cause it’s stolen,”she admits while also showing her toolie in public. But on“Rockin Out,”504IcyGirl flips the menacingly bleakHot Boyz “Ridin’” instrumental with her technicolored hardcore steez.\nIt’s hard not to hear a touch ofTales of Taco Bella-eraRico Nastyin IcyGirl’s style, but a heavy dose of New Orleans vernacular. Maybe her move to Los Angeles will facilitate a quicker rise. It’ll be fun seeing what the 504IcyGirl can do with a plethora of resources at her disposal.\n\nKenneth Brother’s name was inspired by tragedy. His best friend, Kenneth, passed only hours after the Westbank rapper played his final high school football game — a loss in the state championship. A devastating injury in college derailed his NFL dreams, which led him to pick up music and the moniker Kenneth Brother. Now, it’s hard not to know Kenneth’s name in New Orleans.\nKB has established himself as the city’s resident inspirational speaker. The Algiers rapper’s encouraging lyrics can fuel you to put in extra hours on that project you’ve been working on or to only kick down one more door before quitting the game for good. But what matters most to Kenneth Brother is loyalty and positive energy.“And them 4Ls aint for life, before you bro’ ‘em, gotta read 'em,”he advises on“4L”behind pitched-down bells. But don’t get it confused, KB has an aggressive side to him also, one quick to throw a middle finger towards any opponents of his hustle or his close-knit crew. He doesn’t need to make murder threats in his raps to make that point.\nKB’s fan base has only grown as he continues to carry Kenneth’s legacy through music.\n__\nNigel Washingtonis a freelance music, culture, and sports writer from New Orleans, Louisiana.

        "title": "Choosing the Best Song From Every J. Cole Album and Mixtape",
        "description": "J. Cole’smusic catalog is officially old enough to vote, and if you let him tell it, it’s about to have its last growth spurt.\nThe 40-year-old rapper/producer/executive has been soft-pitching his retirement for years, claiming his long-gestatingThe Fall-Offalbum will be his last. But this weekend’s shuttering ofDreamville Festival— his record label’s celebration of music and culture held annually in Raleigh, N.C. — supports the idea that Cole might be preparing to fade to black after all.\nIn the event that Cole bucks the forever trend of rappers pump-faking their exits, he at least seems to be hard at work on delivering a fresh batch of tunes to follow “Port Antonio” and “cLOUDs,” two loosies he’s dropped over the past few months. With that, there’s no better time to look back on his catalog heights.\nAhead of this weekend’s Dreamville Fest, Okayplayer scanned Cole’s album and mixtape catalog — six albums and four mixtapes — to highlight the best song from each. Check out the breakdown below.\n'The Come Up' (2007)Song:“Simba”Drake has his timestamp check-ins. Kendrick’s got six chapters of “The Heart.” Cole’s recurringLion King-themed series predates both — and early in his career, these records deliberately staked his claim for rap’s throne.“Finna blow, inflatable / That's undebatable / I'm givin' niggas food for thought, the flow is catered, yo,”he rhymes on this maiden track in the set, named for Mufasa’s son. Like Simba’s classic sing-along, it was an ambitious declaration from a young cub who couldn’t wait to be king.'The Warm Up' (2009)Best Song:“Lights Please”At face value, the song that got young Jermaine in the same room as young HOV is a creative take on the duality of a man who simply refuses to read the room. A thumping piano sample and intricate drum pattern set the mood as we encounter Cole mid-rant. Deadbeat dads. The prison-industrial complex. Some flagrant shit he saw on Fox News. No topic is off-limits. Meanwhile, his girl wishes he would shut the hell up and hit it in the morning like he promised.For Cole’s early listeners, “Lights Please” served as his lyrical mission statement: equal parts thinking-man angst and horndog narratives. But when you consider a deeper interpretation — that his seducer represents the ways in which the music industry muzzles real talk — it’s clear why this is one of Cole’s most beloved concept records, and why Jay-Z saw so much potential all those years ago.'Friday Night Lights' (2010)Song:“Looking for Trouble,” G.O.O.D. Music Featuring Big Sean, CyHi the Prynce, J. Cole, Kanye West, Pusha-TIn the midst of Kanye West’s weekly G.O.O.D. Friday song release series — a few epic months of 2010’s latter half that are etched in Blog Era lore — this posse cut was a whole-ass moment that earned itself a bonus track slot onFriday Night Lights. For Cole, it was just the latest coronation. A gauntlet throw. A Russell-Crowe-in-Gladiator-level ass-kicking amongst a murderer’s row of MCs. “Make way for the chosen one,” Cole commands. “What you now hear is puttin' fear in all the older ones.” Oof. Ye was looking for trouble. And he damn sure found it.'Cole World: The Sideline Story' (2011)Song:“Work OutNas was dead wrong: There’s nothing cheesy about how Cole crafted this single. The earworm that freed his debut studio album from Roc Nation purgatory cracked the code by melding sung melodies with a familiar Kanye West sample (“The New Workout Plan”) and interpolating a Paula Abdul classic from the ’80s (“Straight Up”). The Carolina spitter slips in some sneaky punchlines (“She bad and she know it / Some niggas save hoes, I'm not that heroic”) but his songwriting is to blame for one of the catchiest songs in his catalog. It’s easy to forget those early swings and misses on his quest for a commercial hit, but this wasn't one of them. I guess you could say it all worked out.'Born Sinner' (2013)Song:“Chaining Day”Once upon a time, J. Cole took home gold and felt like the world’s biggest loser.“Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought,”he bemoans over an ethereal sample chop.“You mix greed, pain, and fame, it’s this heinous result.”This is more than just buyer’s remorse; “Chaining Day” is a bold, conflicted address of an existential question: To bling, or not to bling? Cole gets real about internalized materialism and a desire for external validation. Still, the bars are 24-karat.'2014 Forest Hills Drive' (2014)Song:“Love Yourz”J. Cole’s superpower is his relatability, and his third studio album has that for days. Yet few tracks in his canon — much less this collection — resonate like “Love Yourz.” The project’s centerpiece brings its narrator’s journey full circle: After years of glutton, Cole realizes his addiction to excess is insatiable. Sure, a millionaire lecturing that money can’t buy happiness usually elicits eye rolls, but over a somber string-and-piano combo, Cole somehow cuts through.“As a nigga who was once in your shoes / Livin' with nothin' to lose / I hope one day you hear me,”rhymes Cole, a former scrub. You gotta love it.'4 Your Eyez Only' (2016)Song:“4 Your Eyez Only”Cole reportedly sat in the same spot for 12 hours straight to craft this nearly 9-minute storytelling masterclass that chronicles the life of a friend who became a casualty of the streets. And it shows. The way he builds tension and emotional intensity over dreary horns should be studied. Presented as a lost recording addressed to the young daughter of Cole’s slain homie, this audio clip covers the plight of a hustler who knows his days are numbered in single digits, also bemoaning how America sets up Black folks to fail. Things crescendo when Cole takes on his own POV in the song’s final verse to memorialize his departedwith dramatic urgency. It’ll give you chills every time.'KOD' (2018)Addiction is the central theme ofKOD. This emotional recollection finds Cole focusing on the painful burden he experienced due to his mother’s substance abuse — an affliction he admits he tried to escape. It’s hella honest and raw:“Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more,”he admits over a sparse backdrop,“instead of runnin.’”'The Off-Season' (2021)Song:“The Climb Back”Cole was firmly in the first half of his generational feature run by the time he droppedThe Off-Season, but “The Climb Back” pairs that sharpened lyrical ginsu with an even more nimble flow. He’s in his bag like a receipt, mulling over frienemies, wankstas, and would-be challengers with a ballerina’s grace.“Some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back / Unfortunately, we seen the trap / Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly.”'Might Delete Later' (2024)Song:“Pi,” Feat. Ab-Soul and DaylytIn the days before “7 Minute Drill” became hip-hop’s most infamous retraction ever, chatter circulated suggesting that this deep cut was J. Cole’sactualKendrick Lamar diss — nearly six minutes of lyrical acrobatics that feature battle rapper Daylyt and, curiously, K-Dot crony Ab-Soul. That theory has since been largely abandoned, but it’s easy to understand why bloodthirsty Cole fans rallied behind this wordplay smorgasbord. Dude is talking thatshit. Peep his dismissal of a peer’s “trash” album, his mindblowing Joel Embiid extended reference, his declaration of war-readiness (“I keep the shotty cocked / In case somebody plot / To rob me of this godly spot”). Make no mistake: Everybody eats on “Pi,” but with his ambitious, yet efficient metaphors, Cole left no crumbs.\n\nSong:“Simba”\nDrake has his timestamp check-ins. Kendrick’s got six chapters of “The Heart.” Cole’s recurringLion King-themed series predates both — and early in his career, these records deliberately staked his claim for rap’s throne.“Finna blow, inflatable / That's undebatable / I'm givin' niggas food for thought, the flow is catered, yo,”he rhymes on this maiden track in the set, named for Mufasa’s son.

        "description": "Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.\nRhythm and blues from the ‘90s is the past, present and future.Through the genre’s evolution, ‘90s R&B transformed fromNew Jack Swing, which emerged in the ‘80s — from the likes of Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, and Teddy Riley — to soulful intonations over hip-hop beats inspired by the hustler spirit of Puff Daddy.Along the way ‘90s R&B featured massive vocal talents and superstars who not only soundtracked and represented Black lives, but pop culture at large — setting a widely followed blueprint for the icons and living legends of the 2000s and beyond.Okayplayer is here to directly answer Twitter’s open-endedviral question: “Sco pa tu manaa… '90s R&B” with our list of the 19 most influential R&B albums of '90s. With each selection, we will describe the way in which the respective albumblazed the trail for R&B as well as mention the highlighted hit songs we still sing today.Now, in chronological order, the 19 most influential R&B albums of the '90s.Bell Biv DeVoe - 'Poison' (1990)Wave: New Jack SwingWith fly uptempo rhythms and drum machine-driven beats that fueledhouse parties,The Arsenio Hall Show, andIn Living Color, New Jack Swing seamlessly soundtracked the beginning of the 1990s. At the forefront of the subgenre — alongside Keith Sweat, Al B. Sure, and Karyn White — were New Edition. Towards the end of the ‘80s, the boy band shifted its lineup before splintering into separate acts. While Bobby Brown emerged as the notorious leader of the pack (with a surprisingsolo turnfrom Ralph Tresvant), Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie Devoe kicked off the decade with Bell Biv Devoe’s tone-setting album.Titled after its lead single (whichpeaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100),Poisonincluded the slang driven track “She’s Dope!;” a funky celebration of their moniker, “B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)?” and the New Edition reunion track “Word To The Mutha!”Poisonlived up to what its album cover promised: “Our music is mentally hip-hop smoothed out on the R&B tip with a pop feel appeal to it,” the perfect descriptor for New Jack Swing at its commercial peak.Related Influential New Jack Swing Albums: Ralph Tresvant’sRalph Tresvant(1990); Michael Jackson’sDangerous(1991); En Vogue’sFunky Divas(1992); Bobby Brown’sBobby(1992).Boyz II Men - 'Cooleyhighharmoney' (1991)Wave: [Motown] Philly SoulAt the height of New Jack Swing and soul music being revamped in the early '90s, artists also configured regional nuances to their production and lyricism. For instance, in 1990, Tony! Toni! Toné! represented the West Coast with“It Never Rains (In Southern California)”and “It Feels Good” onRevival.Shawn Stockman and Michael McCary, alongside Nathan and Wayna Morris of Boyz II Men, would provide Philadelphia’s answer. The quartet not only followed the lead of Bell Biv Devoe, but merged the old school showmanship of their label, Motown, with the instrumental stylistics of Philly’s lush funk sound from the '70s. This resulted in Boyz' influential R&B single, “Motownphilly,” followed by “Uhh Ahh” and “Please Don’t Go.”Their acapella cover of G.C. Cameron’s “It’s So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday” (from the 1975 film,Cooley High) placed a spotlight on the harmonies and differentiating tones existing from one of the decade’s most recognizable, influential R&B acts. The group would reissue an extended release ofCooleyhighharmonyin 1993, which included their first Hot 100 No. 1 and breakout international classic, “End of the Road.”Related Influential [Motown] Philly Soul Albums: Phyllis Hyman’sPrime of My Life(1991); Boyz II Men’sII(1994).Sade - 'Love Deluxe' (1992)Wave: Soul Jazz/Sophisti-PopWhen Sade Adu and her eponymous band debuted in 1984 withDiamond Life, she introduced the emerging U.K. subgenre sophisti-pop. Known for balancing smooth jazz, soul and softer pop with the enhancement of oasis-synths, sophisti-pop became the sought after sound for adult contemporary and quiet storm radio formats.While Sade has many exemplary moments on wax, her crowning jewel isLove Deluxe— her only studio album released in the '90s. From the downtempo vibes of “No Ordinary Love” and “Cherish The Day” to the majestic gondola sway of “Like A Tattoo,” Sade deceivingly makes love offset by betrayal sound enchanting. The influential R&B single “Kiss Of Life” best embodies the angelic nature of Sade’s voice and loungey instrumentals, which influenced many of today’s R&B acts,including Drake.Related Influential Sophisti-Pop Albums: Sade’sThe Best of Sade(1994); Simply Red’sLife(1995).Anita Baker - 'Rhythm of Love' (1994)Wave: Classic Soul R&BWhenever a genre goes through rapid transformations that involve new age experimentation for its time, there are always critics. Before New Jack Swing first emerged on the scene, R&B wasreferred to as “circular”and predictable — quickly being cast away as an outdated genre, with the forefathers and mothers fighting to protect its honor once hip hop started to blend.While R&B was going through this transition,people wondered where Anita Baker— who dominated the scene in the '80s — went off to. She returned with a classic sound of old school R&B and vocal technique — which combined jazz and elements of gospel — onRhythm of Love.With a soft sway on “The Look of Love” and a return to herRaptureform on standouts “Body and Soul,” Baker was in the process of preserving the traditional. During the release of this project, Baker admits that this album full of ballads “wasn’t going for anything different,” but rather focused on the emotions: as evident on “I Apologize.”Related Influential Classic Soul Albums: Luther Vandross’sPower of Love(1991); Patti LaBelle’sBurnin’(1991); Aretha Franklin’sA Rose Is Still A Rose(1998).TLC - 'CrazySexyCool' (1994)Wave: Feminist R&BAs a genre, R&B has always celebrated Black women, providing its listeners with some of the most memorable cuts from exemplary female talent. Undoubtedly, the '90s in particular provided the purest outlet for the Black feminine experience through R&B, as well as hip-hop. If there was an album to sum up the adjectives associated with this movement, TLC would successfully describe it asCrazySexyCool.Since their arrival in 1992 with their New Jack Swing manifesto,Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip, Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas became the most influential R&B girl group of the '90s. As their sophomore effort,CrazySexyCoolwas blunt in its nature, affording crossover success and redefining divine confidence. Hit No. 1 singles like “Creep” provided the perspective of a woman who also cheats in a relationship; “Red Light Special” and “Let’s Do It Again” gave sexual instructions for the lovers of bedroom pop; and “Diggin’ On You”lusted after country.In its nature,CrazySexyCoolwas steamy and sultry, as exemplified by “Kick Your Game” which blended new jack swing and hip-hop soul. They even prank call co-executive producer Puff Daddy on the “Sexy-Interlude.” However, the standout single would be “Waterfalls” which advocated for safety during sex and provided a PSA about drugs. With this album, TLCbecame the firstgirl group to becertified Diamond— selling 10 million pure copies in the U.S.Related Influential Feminist R&B Albums: SWV’sIt’s About Time(1992); Janet Jackson’sJanet.(1993); Xscape’sTraces of My Lipstick(1998).Mary J. Blige - 'My Life' (1994)Wave: Hip-Hop SoulWhat had been clear with the New Jack Swing movement was that it wasn’t going to last forever. In fact, the genre started to become more of a fad as R&B approached the mid-'90s. Instead, sonics were starting to settle, and emphasis was placed on reverting back to vocal techniques overpowering the production. This ideology meant direct singing over a hip-hop influenced sound taking over the mainstream: Thus introducing audiences to hip-hop soul.At the forefront of this new wave stood Mary J. Blige, who would be dubbed “The Queen of Hip Hop Soul” by Puffy during her 1992 debutWhat’s The 411?The albumestablished a new superstar force in R&B, but Blige’s follow up,My Life,became her autobiographical thesis statement. She’d end up injecting more soulful vocals in songs such as thetitular track, which heavily sampledRoy Ayers’ “Everybody Loves Sunshine”while professing, “if you look in my life and see what I see.”As a therapeutic project for her ongoing drama of alcoholism, drug abuse, and relationship woos,My Lifereaches the core depths of soul music — sampling Marvin Gaye on “Be Happy,” the Mary Jane Girls and Teddy Pendergrass on “Mary Jane (All Night Long),” and her hip-hop soul peers, Guy, on the deep cut classic “Don’t Go.” The standout, “I’m Goin’ Down,” projected that pain the most, with a raw cover ofRose Royce's 1976 classic. This hallmark album would further set the narrative for Blige, eventually evolving into astellar and legendary legacytoday.Related Influential Hip-Hop Soul Albums: Jodeci’sForever My Lady(1991); Mary J.

Black cinema and television in the '90s benefited from soundtracks that not only fit the mood of their respective visual mediums but also sparked eras of their own. Produced and penned by Babyface,Waiting To Exhale: The Original Soundtrack Albumwent on to sell seven million copies and earned a Grammy nod for Album of the Year.Its success relied on its ability as a compilation featuring all Black women to mirror the ensemble nature of the film. Houston — who starred in this comedy-drama about love and war vignettes from four close girlfriends — provided the soundtrack’s key hit “Exhale (Shoop Shoop)” which reached No. 1 on the Hot 100. Full of jazzy, quiet storm moments that embraced the thrill of love, as well as the powers of healing, this cohesive soundtrack provided Brandy’s earworm“Sittin’ Up In My Room,”Sittin’ Up In My Room,”Mary J. Blige’s “Not Gon’ Cry,” and deep cut gem, “Wey U” from Chanté Moore.Related Influential R&B Soundtracks: Babyface & Various Artists’Boomerang: Original Soundtrack(1992); Whitney Houston’sThe Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album(1992); Various Artists’Soul Food Soundtrack(1997); Various Artists’Love Jones Soundtrack(1997).Maxwell - 'Urban Hang Suite' (1996)Wave: Neo-SoulThe conversations revolving around neo-soul in the '90s centered on a trifecta of debut albums: D’Angelo’sBrown Sugar(1995), Maxwell’sUrban Hang Suite, and Erykah Badu’sBaduizm(1997). Although the genre found its way in the '80s by blending traditional R&B with quiet storm, electronica, jazz, and funk, it didn’t take off in the mainstream until the release of the aforementioned albums.D’Angelo may have gotten the gears running for neo-soul, but many critics regard Maxwell’s effort as what stabilized the subgenre’s position in contemporary R&B. At the time, the album andbohemian characterof Maxwell was nothing like what Black audiences experienced before — as it differentiated from the hip-hop influenced sounds of R&B.Urban Hang Suiteis a concept album that focuses entirely on one passionate romance from start to finish. On “Sumthin’ Sumthin’”he enlists the grooves of the '70s, asking “If it’s cool, I wanna rock with you.” “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)” made late-night radio listeners familiar with Maxwell’s falsetto, while “Whenever Wherever Whatever” provided a lullaby ballad that encapsulated the height of his romantic feelings.Related Influential Neo-Soul Albums: D’Angelo’sBrown Sugar(1995); Erykah Badu’sBaduizm(1997); Maxwell’sEmbrya(1998); Mary J.

By 1995, she had joined the ranks of other soulful divas on theWaiting To Exhalesoundtrack, with “Let It Flow.” That song would eventually lead the way for her sophomore opus,Secrets.The quiet storm format of R&B had taken over mainstream pop music in the early to mid '90s, providing the Black alternative and perspective to adult contemporary pop.Secretswould offer an array of variation on the slower tempoed subgenre — from the groovy Hot 100 No. 1 “You’re Makin’ Me High” (assisted by its B-side “Flow”) to the spoken, sing-song monologue “Talking in His Sleep” to the neo-soul abiding “I Love Me Some Him.”The somber vibes of “Find Me A Man” and Kenny G’s saxophone-enhanced “How Could an Angel Break My Heart” will go down as some of Braxton’s best for her fans. But what she’s most remembered in the international public conscience is her 11-week Hot 100 No. 1 ballad “Un-Break My Heart.”Related Influential Quiet Storm Albums: Toni Braxton’sToni Braxton(1993); Silk’sSilk(1995); Brian McKnight’sAnytime(1997).112 - '112' (1996)Wave: Bad Boy [Records] R&BIf there was one record label that had a distinct presence and sound in '90s R&B it would be Diddy’s Bad Boy Records. Diddy’s “Puffy influence” not only existed amongst his label’s roster, but also trickled into the production of acts such as Mary J. Blige and TLC. In the mid-'90s, he’d audition and signed the Atlanta quartet of Quinnes “Q” Parker, Daron Jones, Marvin “Slim” Scandrick, and Michael “Mike” Keith. By the end of summer 1996, Bad Boy delivered 112’s eponymous debut LP.With production from Stevie J, one of the label’s first “Hitmen,” as well as New Jack Swing pioneer Al B. Sure and Boyz II Men’s Wanya Morris,112offered a younger, fresher take on contemporary R&B. The boy group would twist quiet storm on cuts such as “I Will Be There,” flip duets upside down with the Faith Evans assisted “I Can’t Believe,” flex their music insight on the “Keep It Real (Interlude),” and reenergize hip-hop soul on “Come See Me.”Their hit single “Only You” would receive the Bad Boy remix treatment, while the airy sound effects on “Cupid” propelled it as the album’s platinum-selling staple. 112’s success would continue in 1998 with their sophomore effort,Room 112.Related Influential Bad Boy [Records] Albums: Faith Evans’sFaith(1995); Total’sTotal(1996); Faith Evans’sKeep The Faith(1998).Aaliyah - 'One In A Million' (1996)Wave: Electro-R&BWhile evaluating Aaliyah’s legacy, it’s important to note that the late entertainer was lightyears ahead in the midst of what was popular. Her 1994 debut album,Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number,may have come at the tail-end of New Jack Swing’s peak, but it provided a template for emerging teen talent of '90s R&B such as Brandy and Monica. Listening toOne In A Million, it’s evident the album takes the lead of hip-hop soul, but it also manages to voyage into the future through its production.Needing to separate from the messy tabloids of R. Kelly, who executive producedAge, Aaliyah partnered with emerging producers and songwriters Timbaland and Missy Elliott. Electronic elements always played a part in contemporary R&B — however Aaliyah’s approach offered ahopping alternative. The titular track sounded as if it was orbiting in outer space, simultaneously giving radio an infectious sound airwaves never experienced before.The thumping drum and bass line on tracks such as“Beats 4 Da Streets,”“If Your Girl Only Knew,” and the remix of“Hot Like Fire”Hot Like Fire”experimented with UK electronic genres jungle and downtempo. Aaliyah also redefined what '90s cool was with her effortlessly lyric soprano vocals on quiet storm gems“4 Page Letter,”the Isley Brothers’ cover“Choosey Lover,”and the Diane Warren-penned“The One I Gave My Heart To.”Agemight have arguably closed out new jack swing, butOne In A Millioncertainly sparked an electronic revolution for the remainder of the decade.Related Influential Electro-R&B Albums: Missy Elliott’sSupa Dupa Fly(1997); Total’sKima, Keisha, and Pam(1998).Kirk Franklin - 'God's Property from Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation' (1997)Wave: Gospel R&B/Urban Contemporary GospelToday, modern R&B debates are interesting because they always bring up the notion of “church singing” aka gospel playing a major part in real R&B. There’s some truth in this revelation, as most legendary, influential R&B acts have found their basis from singing in a Christian church during their upbringing. Throughout R&B’s history — particularly soul singing — religion has played a part, most likely becoming a necessity for what is identified as “real R&B.”However, in the late '90s into the 2000s, R&B was being blamed for ruining church music, aka the genre of Gospel. Referred to as “secular,” the blending of R&B with gospel washeavily frowned upon, as Urban Contemporary Gospel started to grow in the mainstream.Leading the way in the '90s was Kirk Franklin, who found success with “Stomp!” and managed to propel his fourth studio album,God’s Property,to No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Other cuts like “My Life Is In Your Hands” and “So Good” delivered raw emotion that paralleled what '90s R&B acts had been doing from the start. This collective album would lead the way for Yolanda Albums who’d deliver “Open My Heart” in 1999 and Mary Mary who’d autotune “Shackles” in 2000.Related Influential Gospel R&B Albums: Bebe and Cece Winans’sDifferent Lifestyles(1991); Yolanda Adam’sMountain High… Valley Low(1999).Mariah Carey - 'Butterfly ' (1997)Wave: Hip-Pop&B CrossoverIntroducing the “Fantasy” remixwith an assist from Wu-Tang’s Ol Dirty Bastard, Mariah Carey sought to change pop music by announcing her independence. Known to straddle the line between pop and R&B, Carey’s crossover appeal would enter a new legion with her next No. 1 Hot 100 smash, “Honey,” which was remixed by Puffy and his Bad Boy crew. With this love for hip-hop, the Songbird Supreme was responsible forbirthingthe genre of hip-pop, according to Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes.Carey often regardsButterflyas her magnum opus and it’s clear to see why. Not only did she tackle hip-hop soul head first, but she made it acceptable for pop acts to embrace rappers many years before it became commercially second nature. Cuts like “The Roof” would sample Mobb Deep, while “Babydoll” abided Missy Elliott’s penmanship. “Breakdown” celebrated the rise of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, while No. 1 Hot 100 hit “My All” also received the remix treatment.WithButterfly, R&B not only solidified its position in pop but now became the de facto trendsetter on unapologeticremixingterms acknowledged by a global audience and the industry at large.Related Influential Hip-Pop&B Crossover Albums: Adina Howard’sDo You Wanna Ride?(1995); Montell Jordan’sLet’s Ride(1998); Mariah Carey’sRainbow(1999).Usher - 'My Way' (1997)Wave: Casanova/Mr. Steal Your Girl R&BIn between Levert singing about being a “Casanova” that wasn’t friends with Romeo back in 1988 to Trey Songz declaring he was “Mr. Steal Your Girl” in 2014, the male acts of R&B had been known for beingmacksand playboys on wax. To be honest, this was the history of R&B since it starts. But '90s R&B had a way with male singers being smooth about their intentions, honoring the theatrics of a Casanova archetype.In 1997, Usher would break out of the crowded pack — ultimately leading the way for his pop and influential R&B takeover in the 2000s.My Waygave the plea “You Make Me Wanna…” where the singer was anxious to leave his current relationship and start another. Through his choreography, he wanted to take things “Nice & Slow” to the satisfaction of quiet storm listeners who admired his Monica-debut “Slow Jam,” as he commanded things go “My Way.”While '90s R&B had many breakout Casanova moments, Usher commanded the attention the best, staking his claim in pop music along the way. He’d make acts like Keith Sweat and Bobby Brown proud, as the contemporary godson of their antics. Usher would also follow the footsteps of Ginuwine, who had saddled up his own sexual“Pony,” andcounter Tyrese who was on a mission to woo the “Sweet Lady” of his life.Related Influential Casanova Albums: Keith Sweat’sKeith Sweat(1996); Ginuwine’sGinuwine… The Bachelor(1996); Joe’sAll That I Am(1997); Tyrese’sTyrese(1998).Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope (1997)Wave: Conscious R&BOne thing about the Jackson siblings is how they were always present with the social issues of their time.The Velvet Ropenot only embraced the energies of '90s R&B but also allowed Janet to get personal with her artistic evolution — more so than the ground she broke on 1989’sRhythm Nation 1814andJanet.She would sexually moan on “My Need”after calling her friend about her desires on the “Interlude- Speaker Phone,” which would be manifested on the funky “Go Deep” and the smooth“I Get Lonely.”“You”experimented with trip-hop, as did the album’s lead single “Got ‘Til It’s Gone” which featured Q-Tip and Joni Mitchell.Velvet Ropealso celebrated the LGBTQ community with songs such as “Free Xone” which included the lyrics“Until he found out he was gay / That's so not mellow / Let's get free.”Rumors about Janet’s sexuality also surfaced when shecoveredRod Stewart’s “Tonight’s The Night.” Janet also set forth commentary about social media on “Interlude - Online,” which featured a dial-up connection and typing on a keyboard. Janet not only got conscious with the taboo, but also prophetically redirected the course of internet conversation in the process withVelvet Rope.Related Influential Conscious R&B Album: Michael Jackson’sHIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I(1995).Lenny Kravitz - '5' (1998)Wave: Psychedelic R&BKicking off the '90s, Lenny Kravitz earned a Top 10 hit on the R&B charts withMama Said’s “It Ain’t Over ‘Til It’s Over.” That song noticeably blended the psychedelic sounds of rock from the '60s (a la Jimi Hendrix) and funk R&B from the '70s (a la George Clinton and the Parliament).Kravitz would continue to be acknowledged as a bona fide rock star during the decade.5featured songs such as “Supersoulfighter,” and the hypnotic “I Belong To You.” It’s as if Prince’sPurple Rainwent on a psychedelic trip through Kravitz. The breakout hit from 5 would be “Fly Away,” which went on to be acknowledged as Kravitz’s staple song.Related Influential Psychedelic R&B Albums: Prince’sThe Gold Experience(1995); Meshell Ndegeocello’sBitter(1999).Brandy - 'Never Say Never' (1998)Wave: Urban PopKnown as America’s sweetheart, Brandy was looking for something to not only enhance her sound, but also lead the pack for other pop stars observing her every move. Towards the tail end of the '90s, it had become clear that pop music was leaning towards more of a street edge to compete with and embrace hip-hop and R&B’s dominance — birthing “urban pop.” Partnering with Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins, the teen mogul would releaseNever Say Never, the blueprint for her signature sound.At the time of the album’s release, pop music was destined to head in a new direction, and Black teens such as Brandy, Monica, Usher, and Mýa were leading the way. Brandy would have the hottest song of the summer alongside Monica with “The Boy Is Mine” which played off a rumored rivalry between the two. She’d garner another No.1 with Diane Warren’s ballad “Have You Ever?”Songs like “Angel In Disguise” and “Happy” embraced electro-R&B. “Put That On Everything” and “Almost Doesn’t Count” capitalized on the surging quiet storm movement. Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears wouldciteBrandy as an influence for their debut albums and eras which came out later in the decade.Related Influential Urban Pop Albums: Monica’sBoy Is Mine(1998); Mýa’sMýa(1998); Tamia’sTamia(1998).Lauryn Hill - 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' (1998)Wave: Diaspora R&BIt’s quite hard to pinpoint what Lauryn Hill’s debut effort as a solo artist is. To be honest,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hillhas a little bit of everything: “Lost Ones” found Lauryn rapping a diss while “Doo Wop (That Thing)” was both conscious and traditional R&B abiding.“Ex-Factor” dominated quiet storm radio, while “I Used To Love Him” followed the lead of the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige. There were elements of neo-soul throughout the album, particularly on “Nothing Even Matters” featuring D’Angelo, as well as gospel on “To Zion” and “Tell Him.” “Forgive Them Father” set out to be an interpretation of Bob Marley’s “Concrete Jungle,” incorporating elements of reggae.With all these genre influences that ranged throughout black music across continents — expanding the trans-Atlantic range — Lauryn Hill provided an all-encompassing diaspora album. So much so that it would end upclaiming Album of the Year at the 1999 Grammys.Related Influential Diaspora R&B Albums: Mint Condition’sFrom The Mint Factory(1993); Kelis’sKaleidoscope(1999).Destiny’s Child - 'The Writing’s On The Wall' (1999)Wave: Y2K Pop&BBy the end of the decade, it had become clear that R&B was fully accepting electro-pop and birthing the next generation of superstars. Destiny’s Child was no exception, providing club-ready anthems such as “Bills, Bills, Bills,” “Say My Name,” and “Jumpin’, Jumpin’.” While the group literally transitioned in front of our eyes, they continued to provide No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.WithWritings on the Wall, Destiny’s Child set the tone for the upcoming millennium of R&B. They commented on technology with “Bug A Boo,” signaled how slow jams would be more midtempo with “Temptation” and celebrated girl power with “Hey Ladies.” As a result, this album would lay the groundwork for the solo run of Kelly Rowland, and the dominance of Beyoncé — who both would go on to redefine pop and R&B music by the early-2000s.Related Influential Y2K Pop&B Albums: TLC’sFanMail(1999); Jennifer Lopez’sOn The 6(1999).__Da’Shan Smith is a pop culture writer based out of New York City.

At the forefront of the subgenre — alongside Keith Sweat, Al B. Sure, and Karyn White — were New Edition. Towards the end of the ‘80s, the boy band shifted its lineup before splintering into separate acts. While Bobby Brown emerged as the notorious leader of the pack (with a surprisingsolo turnfrom Ralph Tresvant), Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie Devoe kicked off the decade with Bell Biv Devoe’s tone-setting album.\nTitled after its lead single (whichpeaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100),Poisonincluded the slang driven track “She’s Dope!;” a funky celebration of their moniker, “B.B.D.

For instance, in 1990, Tony! Toni! Toné! represented the West Coast with“It Never Rains (In Southern California)”and “It Feels Good” onRevival.\nShawn Stockman and Michael McCary, alongside Nathan and Wayna Morris of Boyz II Men, would provide Philadelphia’s answer. The quartet not only followed the lead of Bell Biv Devoe, but merged the old school showmanship of their label, Motown, with the instrumental stylistics of Philly’s lush funk sound from the '70s. This resulted in Boyz' influential R&B single, “Motownphilly,” followed by “Uhh Ahh” and “Please Don’t Go.”\nTheir acapella cover of G.C. Cameron’s “It’s So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday” (from the 1975 film,Cooley High) placed a spotlight on the harmonies and differentiating tones existing from one of the decade’s most recognizable, influential R&B acts.

From the downtempo vibes of “No Ordinary Love” and “Cherish The Day” to the majestic gondola sway of “Like A Tattoo,” Sade deceivingly makes love offset by betrayal sound enchanting.

Blige’s “Not Gon’ Cry,” and deep cut gem, “Wey U” from Chanté Moore.\nRelated Influential R&B Soundtracks: Babyface & Various Artists’Boomerang: Original Soundtrack(1992); Whitney Houston’sThe Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album(1992); Various Artists’Soul Food Soundtrack(1997); Various Artists’Love Jones Soundtrack(1997).\n\nWave: Neo-Soul\nThe conversations revolving around neo-soul in the '90s centered on a trifecta of debut albums: D’Angelo’sBrown Sugar(1995), Maxwell’sUrban Hang Suite, and Erykah Badu’sBaduizm(1997). Although the genre found its way in the '80s by blending traditional R&B with quiet storm, electronica, jazz, and funk, it didn’t take off in the mainstream until the release of the aforementioned albums.\nD’Angelo may have gotten the gears running for neo-soul, but many critics regard Maxwell’s effort as what stabilized the subgenre’s position in contemporary R&B. At the time, the album andbohemian characterof Maxwell was nothing like what Black audiences experienced before — as it differentiated from the hip-hop influenced sounds of R&B.\nUrban Hang Suiteis a concept album that focuses entirely on one passionate romance from start to finish. On “Sumthin’ Sumthin’”he enlists the grooves of the '70s, asking “If it’s cool, I wanna rock with you.” “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)” made late-night radio listeners familiar with Maxwell’s falsetto, while “Whenever Wherever Whatever” provided a lullaby ballad that encapsulated the height of his romantic feelings.\nRelated Influential Neo-Soul Albums: D’Angelo’sBrown Sugar(1995); Erykah Badu’sBaduizm(1997); Maxwell’sEmbrya(1998); Mary J. Blige’sMary(1999); Donell Jones’sWhere I Wanna Be(1999).\n\nWave: Quiet Storm\nIn 1993, Toni Braxton dominated R&B radio with her self-titled debut which featured lulling midtempos and ballads that showcased her domineering contralto vocal prowess. By 1995, she had joined the ranks of other soulful divas on theWaiting To Exhalesoundtrack, with “Let It Flow.” That song would eventually lead the way for her sophomore opus,Secrets.\nThe quiet storm format of R&B had taken over mainstream pop music in the early to mid '90s, providing the Black alternative and perspective to adult contemporary pop.Secretswould offer an array of variation on the slower tempoed subgenre — from the groovy Hot 100 No. 1 “You’re Makin’ Me High” (assisted by its B-side “Flow”) to the spoken, sing-song monologue “Talking in His Sleep” to the neo-soul abiding “I Love Me Some Him.”\nThe somber vibes of “Find Me A Man” and Kenny G’s saxophone-enhanced “How Could an Angel Break My Heart” will go down as some of Braxton’s best for her fans. But what she’s most remembered in the international public conscience is her 11-week Hot 100 No. 1 ballad “Un-Break My Heart.”\nRelated Influential Quiet Storm Albums: Toni Braxton’sToni Braxton(1993); Silk’sSilk(1995); Brian McKnight’sAnytime(1997).\n\nWave: Bad Boy [Records] R&B\nIf there was one record label that had a distinct presence and sound in '90s R&B it would be Diddy’s Bad Boy Records. Diddy’s “Puffy influence” not only existed amongst his label’s roster, but also trickled into the production of acts such as Mary J. Blige and TLC. In the mid-'90s, he’d audition and signed the Atlanta quartet of Quinnes “Q” Parker, Daron Jones, Marvin “Slim” Scandrick, and Michael “Mike” Keith. By the end of summer 1996, Bad Boy delivered 112’s eponymous debut LP.\nWith production from Stevie J, one of the label’s first “Hitmen,” as well as New Jack Swing pioneer Al B. Sure and Boyz II Men’s Wanya Morris,112offered a younger, fresher take on contemporary R&B. The boy group would twist quiet storm on cuts such as “I Will Be There,” flip duets upside down with the Faith Evans assisted “I Can’t Believe,” flex their music insight on the “Keep It Real (Interlude),” and reenergize hip-hop soul on “Come See Me.”\nTheir hit single “Only You” would receive the Bad Boy remix treatment, while the airy sound effects on “Cupid” propelled it as the album’s platinum-selling staple. 112’s success would continue in 1998 with their sophomore effort,Room 112.\nRelated Influential Bad Boy [Records] Albums: Faith Evans’sFaith(1995); Total’sTotal(1996); Faith Evans’sKeep The Faith(1998).\n\nWave: Electro-R&B\nWhile evaluating Aaliyah’s legacy, it’s important to note that the late entertainer was lightyears ahead in the midst of what was popular. Her 1994 debut album,Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number,may have come at the tail-end of New Jack Swing’s peak, but it provided a template for emerging teen talent of '90s R&B such as Brandy and Monica. Listening toOne In A Million, it’s evident the album takes the lead of hip-hop soul, but it also manages to voyage into the future through its production.\nNeeding to separate from the messy tabloids of R. Kelly, who executive producedAge, Aaliyah partnered with emerging producers and songwriters Timbaland and Missy Elliott. Electronic elements always played a part in contemporary R&B — however Aaliyah’s approach offered ahopping alternative. The titular track sounded as if it was orbiting in outer space, simultaneously giving radio an infectious sound airwaves never experienced before.\nThe thumping drum and bass line on tracks such as“Beats 4 Da Streets,”“If Your Girl Only Knew,” and the remix of“Hot Like Fire”Hot Like Fire”experimented with UK electronic genres jungle and downtempo. Aaliyah also redefined what '90s cool was with her effortlessly lyric soprano vocals on quiet storm gems“4 Page Letter,”the Isley Brothers’ cover“Choosey Lover,”and the Diane Warren-penned“The One I Gave My Heart To.”Agemight have arguably closed out new jack swing, butOne In A Millioncertainly sparked an electronic revolution for the remainder of the decade.\nRelated Influential Electro-R&B Albums: Missy Elliott’sSupa Dupa Fly(1997); Total’sKima, Keisha, and Pam(1998).\n\nWave: Gospel R&B/Urban Contemporary Gospel\nToday, modern R&B debates are interesting because they always bring up the notion of “church singing” aka gospel playing a major part in real R&B. There’s some truth in this revelation, as most legendary, influential R&B acts have found their basis from singing in a Christian church during their upbringing. Throughout R&B’s history — particularly soul singing — religion has played a part, most likely becoming a necessity for what is identified as “real R&B.”\nHowever, in the late '90s into the 2000s, R&B was being blamed for ruining church music, aka the genre of Gospel. Referred to as “secular,” the blending of R&B with gospel washeavily frowned upon, as Urban Contemporary Gospel started to grow in the mainstream.\nLeading the way in the '90s was Kirk Franklin, who found success with “Stomp!” and managed to propel his fourth studio album,God’s Property,to No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Other cuts like “My Life Is In Your Hands” and “So Good” delivered raw emotion that paralleled what '90s R&B acts had been doing from the start. This collective album would lead the way for Yolanda Albums who’d deliver “Open My Heart” in 1999 and Mary Mary who’d autotune “Shackles” in 2000.\nRelated Influential Gospel R&B Albums: Bebe and Cece Winans’sDifferent Lifestyles(1991); Yolanda Adam’sMountain High… Valley Low(1999).\n\nWave: Hip-Pop&B Crossover\nIntroducing the “Fantasy” remixwith an assist from Wu-Tang’s Ol Dirty Bastard, Mariah Carey sought to change pop music by announcing her independence. Known to straddle the line between pop and R&B, Carey’s crossover appeal would enter a new legion with her next No. 1 Hot 100 smash, “Honey,” which was remixed by Puffy and his Bad Boy crew. With this love for hip-hop, the Songbird Supreme was responsible forbirthingthe genre of hip-pop, according to Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes.\nCarey often regardsButterflyas her magnum opus and it’s clear to see why. Not only did she tackle hip-hop soul head first, but she made it acceptable for pop acts to embrace rappers many years before it became commercially second nature. Cuts like “The Roof” would sample Mobb Deep, while “Babydoll” abided Missy Elliott’s penmanship. “Breakdown” celebrated the rise of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, while No. 1 Hot 100 hit “My All” also received the remix treatment.\nWithButterfly, R&B not only solidified its position in pop but now became the de facto trendsetter on unapologeticremixingterms acknowledged by a global audience and the industry at large.\nRelated Influential Hip-Pop&B Crossover Albums: Adina Howard’sDo You Wanna Ride?(1995); Montell Jordan’sLet’s Ride(1998); Mariah Carey’sRainbow(1999).\n\nWave: Casanova/Mr. Steal Your Girl R&B\nIn between Levert singing about being a “Casanova” that wasn’t friends with Romeo back in 1988 to Trey Songz declaring he was “Mr. Steal Your Girl” in 2014, the male acts of R&B had been known for beingmacksand playboys on wax. To be honest, this was the history of R&B since it starts. But '90s R&B had a way with male singers being smooth about their intentions, honoring the theatrics of a Casanova archetype.\nIn 1997, Usher would break out of the crowded pack — ultimately leading the way for his pop and influential R&B takeover in the 2000s.My Waygave the plea “You Make Me Wanna…” where the singer was anxious to leave his current relationship and start another. Through his choreography, he wanted to take things “Nice & Slow” to the satisfaction of quiet storm listeners who admired his Monica-debut “Slow Jam,” as he commanded things go “My Way.”\nWhile '90s R&B had many breakout Casanova moments, Usher commanded the attention the best, staking his claim in pop music along the way. He’d make acts like Keith Sweat and Bobby Brown proud, as the contemporary godson of their antics. Usher would also follow the footsteps of Ginuwine, who had saddled up his own sexual“Pony,” andcounter Tyrese who was on a mission to woo the “Sweet Lady” of his life.\nRelated Influential Casanova Albums: Keith Sweat’sKeith Sweat(1996); Ginuwine’sGinuwine… The Bachelor(1996); Joe’sAll That I Am(1997); Tyrese’sTyrese(1998).\n\nWave: Conscious R&B\nOne thing about the Jackson siblings is how they were always present with the social issues of their time.The Velvet Ropenot only embraced the energies of '90s R&B but also allowed Janet to get personal with her artistic evolution — more so than the ground she broke on 1989’sRhythm Nation 1814andJanet.\nShe would sexually moan on “My Need”after calling her friend about her desires on the “Interlude- Speaker Phone,” which would be manifested on the funky “Go Deep” and the smooth“I Get Lonely.”“You”experimented with trip-hop, as did the album’s lead single “Got ‘Til It’s Gone” which featured Q-Tip and Joni Mitchell.\nVelvet Ropealso celebrated the LGBTQ community with songs such as “Free Xone” which included the lyrics“Until he found out he was gay / That's so not mellow / Let's get free.”Rumors about Janet’s sexuality also surfaced when shecoveredRod Stewart’s “Tonight’s The Night.” Janet also set forth commentary about social media on “Interlude - Online,” which featured a dial-up connection and typing on a keyboard. Janet not only got conscious with the taboo, but also prophetically redirected the course of internet conversation in the process withVelvet Rope.\nRelated Influential Conscious R&B Album: Michael Jackson’sHIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I(1995).\n\nWave: Psychedelic R&B\nKicking off the '90s, Lenny Kravitz earned a Top 10 hit on the R&B charts withMama Said’s “It Ain’t Over ‘Til It’s Over.” That song noticeably blended the psychedelic sounds of rock from the '60s (a la Jimi Hendrix) and funk R&B from the '70s (a la George Clinton and the Parliament).\nKravitz would continue to be acknowledged as a bona fide rock star during the decade.5featured songs such as “Supersoulfighter,” and the hypnotic “I Belong To You.” It’s as if Prince’sPurple Rainwent on a psychedelic trip through Kravitz. The breakout hit from 5 would be “Fly Away,” which went on to be acknowledged as Kravitz’s staple song.\nRelated Influential Psychedelic R&B Albums: Prince’sThe Gold Experience(1995); Meshell Ndegeocello’sBitter(1999).\n\nWave: Urban Pop\nKnown as America’s sweetheart, Brandy was looking for something to not only enhance her sound, but also lead the pack for other pop stars observing her every move. Towards the tail end of the '90s, it had become clear that pop music was leaning towards more of a street edge to compete with and embrace hip-hop and R&B’s dominance — birthing “urban pop.” Partnering with Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins, the teen mogul would releaseNever Say Never, the blueprint for her signature sound.\nAt the time of the album’s release, pop music was destined to head in a new direction, and Black teens such as Brandy, Monica, Usher, and Mýa were leading the way. Brandy would have the hottest song of the summer alongside Monica with “The Boy Is Mine” which played off a rumored rivalry between the two. She’d garner another No.1 with Diane Warren’s ballad “Have You Ever?”\nSongs like “Angel In Disguise” and “Happy” embraced electro-R&B. “Put That On Everything” and “Almost Doesn’t Count” capitalized on the surging quiet storm movement. Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears wouldciteBrandy as an influence for their debut albums and eras which came out later in the decade.\nRelated Influential Urban Pop Albums: Monica’sBoy Is Mine(1998); Mýa’sMýa(1998); Tamia’sTamia(1998).\n\nWave: Diaspora R&B\nIt’s quite hard to pinpoint what Lauryn Hill’s debut effort as a solo artist is. To be honest,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hillhas a little bit of everything: “Lost Ones” found Lauryn rapping a diss while “Doo Wop (That Thing)” was both conscious and traditional R&B abiding.\n“Ex-Factor” dominated quiet storm radio, while “I Used To Love Him” followed the lead of the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige. There were elements of neo-soul throughout the album, particularly on “Nothing Even Matters” featuring D’Angelo, as well as gospel on “To Zion” and “Tell Him.” “Forgive Them Father” set out to be an interpretation of Bob Marley’s “Concrete Jungle,” incorporating elements of reggae.\nWith all these genre influences that ranged throughout black music across continents — expanding the trans-Atlantic range — Lauryn Hill provided an all-encompassing diaspora album. So much so that it would end upclaiming Album of the Year at the 1999 Grammys.\nRelated Influential Diaspora R&B Albums: Mint Condition’sFrom The Mint Factory(1993); Kelis’sKaleidoscope(1999).\n\nWave: Y2K Pop&B\nBy the end of the decade, it had become clear that R&B was fully accepting electro-pop and birthing the next generation of superstars. Destiny’s Child was no exception, providing club-ready anthems such as “Bills, Bills, Bills,” “Say My Name,” and “Jumpin’, Jumpin’.” While the group literally transitioned in front of our eyes, they continued to provide No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.\nWithWritings on the Wall, Destiny’s Child set the tone for the upcoming millennium of R&B. They commented on technology with “Bug A Boo,” signaled how slow jams would be more midtempo with “Temptation” and celebrated girl power with “Hey Ladies.” As a result, this album would lay the groundwork for the solo run of Kelly Rowland, and the dominance of Beyoncé — who both would go on to redefine pop and R&B music by the early-2000s.\nRelated Influential Y2K Pop&B Albums: TLC’sFanMail(1999); Jennifer Lopez’sOn The 6(1999).\n__\nDa’Shan Smith is a pop culture writer based out of New York City.

        "description": "Santigold[neé Santi White] is a genre-defying powerhouse who has spent nearly two decades bending the rules of music, blending punk, reggae, electronic and hip-hop into a sound that’s entirely her own. From her fearless self-titled debut to her boundary-pushing independent releases, the Philly-born artist continues to champion creative freedom, inspiring a generation of artists to embrace their uniqueness without compromise.\nAs part ofOkayplayer’scelebration of Women’s History Month, we’re sharing Santi’s thoughts on being an artist, music as liberation and breaking out of the strong Black woman schemaIn Her Words. The as-told-to below has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nPhoto by Frank Ockenfels.On Her ‘Noble Champions’ PodcastSantigold:I just finished the second season of my podcastNoble Champions, and I love it. But logistically, it’s a lot. I love the conversations so much. I love the guests. It's really nice to be able to talk about things in a way that you don't often get to. Sometimes it takes five months to schedule one, and then the day of, somebody will be like, ‘I missed my flight. Sorry.’ And then the other guest will be like, ‘Well I’m not available again for two more months.’ You don't want all the same type of people on there. HaveVince Staplestalking with Kiese Laymon about patriarchy. That’s what makes it fun.I hadSeun Kutiand my friend Adesuwa [Aighewi], who are both Nigerian, on the last episode. We talked about the relationship between Africa and its diaspora globally — about how hard it is to get to a certain level in Nigeria and to stay there, to grow businesses, and how we could work together across the globe to help Africa step into its amazing future — and all of us as Africans around the world step into our amazing future.Africa is poised to win. It has the youngest population, it has all the resources, but many of the same systemic problems we do as African Americans living here in the States.Discovering Music As A Platform For ExpressionFrom a very young age, my dad used to take me, my brother and my sister to the record store every weekend and let us pick outwhateverwe wanted. He just wanted us to like music.I don’t remember a weekend when there wasn’t music playing in our house. It was all about Black music from my dad — jazz, reggae, African music, revolutionary music. My sister, who’s three years older, was the one who brought in all the other influences — punk, classic rock, Joni Mitchell, folk music. But my dad was playing topical music, because that’s what people made back then. All the songs had messages, all of them. Whether it was Steel Pulse, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, Fela Kuti. Everybody was singing about liberation.My dad made me readThe Autobiography of Malcolm Xas a kid. Like, ‘You can read? Here – read this.’ So I came up thinking that music was just the platform for talking about this stuff. I started finding my own music and listening to my sister’s stuff. I loved The Smiths, and I loved Morrissey’s lyrics and Joni Mitchell’s lyrics and Jimi Hendrix’s lyrics. I even loved Nirvana and Kurt Cobain’s lyrics because these were personal lyrics. These were not necessarily about global community, but it was like, ‘How am I feeling?’ This is my journal, I can say anything I want.So between those two influences of what writing was in music, that shaped what I used music for and it became my platform to speak the things that needed to be said, whether to myself or more to the community. But I also learned that when you speak to yourself in your music, community too. They hear it and think,That’s me. I feel the same way.I think the most powerful thing that you can give is connectivity, an opportunity for people to feel seen.Photo by Frank Ockenfels.Economic Resistance As The Path ForwardI just played shows in Texas andFlorida, and I guarantee you some people who have completely different views than I do were at my shows. So am I going to start saying things that are going to alienate those people at my shows? Or am I going to sing my songs, which by nature are helping get some of my beliefs across while they’re vibing?There are certain human needs that transcend all of that stuff. And if we can start relating on that level, we might actually find a way through this.I think it’s hard because back in the day they would organize a boycott forever. It would be nationwide, like ‘We’re all going to do this and it’s going to go on for this amount of time.’ But now, it’s on Instagram and you don’t even get the feed until three days later.Our freedom is tied up in their money. Freedom, humanity, civil rights, none of that matters because that gets in the way of making the most money possible for a few people and as long as they keep us fighting they can just keep with that agenda.I do believe in this day and age, the only way to have impact is through economics. Money is the only thing that talks in this government. They don’t care about the protests, they don’t care about what we post online. They care about money.The Myth of “Having It All”The current pace of life is unsustainable for everyone. And when you throw being a mother into the mix, being a creative, or just being a sentient being in this world, it’s like things are stacked against us.Doing shows is like being an athlete; being on the road you have to have enough sleep, you have to be eating properly, to make sure you don’t lose your voice. You can’t get sick. You have to have enough energy every night. You’re flying, so you’re on these dirty, germy planes and you’re changing time zones. Your sleep is off as you’re dealing with all that. You’re in front of all these people, managing all this energy, then come home, and it’s straight into mom mode — taking out braids, making dinner, managing schedules. There’s no exhale.I remember I got dropped by my business manager when I was pregnant with twins because I wasn’t making as much money. That should be illegal, but it still happens all the time.I really believe that every change starts with the individual and our own beliefs and things we subscribe to – we really need to start changing those definitions to fit where we want to get to.Photo by Frank Ockenfels.Redefining What Success Looks Like As A Black WomanI started out recognizing myself as an artist through visual art. In high school, I painted a lot and I ended up winning the Senior Studio Art Award. In college, the problem was, I was painting, I was making music and I was writing and I was having a hard time figuring out how to merge all of them. You get a creative impulse, then you get stuck because you’re like, ‘Which one do I do?’ Then you kind of freeze. I put painting aside, because I realized I could merge writing with music and so I did that.What I learned is that I’m an artist across many mediums, so I can do art all the time, even if I’m not painting. Everything I think of is from a creative perspective, whether it’s creating my stage show, which I’ve always curated – from the dancers to the costumes, the choreography to the visuals, extending to the merch. Or videos. I started directing my own videos a while back and realized music to me is visual, all I have to do is close my eyes and the whole thing just paints itself before me. It’s all right there in the music. That’s why I want to take this into film. I wrote a movie partially so I could make the costumes and do the music for it.Then there’s the book I’m writing. My book is a memoir, but it goes back four generations of women in my family, to my great-grandmother, my grandmother, my mother and me. There’s a lot in there about being a survivor and a Black woman and having the Strong Black Woman schema to contend with and stepping out of survival mode into a place where we feel we have permission to need support or rest or self-care.That is something I’m trying to work on because I feel as a Black woman artist, there’s so much that needs to be unpacked – like even stepping outside of the oversexed persona Black women have always had as performers. It’s still so prevalent. Every new artist, they come out and the first thing you see is their ass. That shouldn’t be what you feel like you have to do.Walking this less trodden path where I’m not doing that and I’m leading with my art, and then with me having the tendency of working myself to death like all Black women — it’s definitely a harder path when you’re not doing what everyone else is doing — not just leading with sexuality but also making a certain kind of music that’s easily digestible or stays in the little Black Music box that you’re supposed to fit in.I’ve chosen a challenging road for myself. And what is success? Are you going to subscribe to other people’s versions of success that has you killing yourself and never having enough? These are things that I’ve been working through and figuring out that I don’t have to live by other people’s rules of beauty or femininity or success. I’m starting to redefine what all those things mean for myself.\nPhoto by Frank Ockenfels.\nSantigold:I just finished the second season of my podcastNoble Champions, and I love it. But logistically, it’s a lot. I love the conversations so much. I love the guests. It's really nice to be able to talk about things in a way that you don't often get to. Sometimes it takes five months to schedule one, and then the day of, somebody will be like, ‘I missed my flight. Sorry.’ And then the other guest will be like, ‘Well I’m not available again for two more months.’ You don't want all the same type of people on there. HaveVince Staplestalking with Kiese Laymon about patriarchy. That’s what makes it fun.\nI hadSeun Kutiand my friend Adesuwa [Aighewi], who are both Nigerian, on the last episode. We talked about the relationship between Africa and its diaspora globally — about how hard it is to get to a certain level in Nigeria and to stay there, to grow businesses, and how we could work together across the globe to help Africa step into its amazing future — and all of us as Africans around the world step into our amazing future.\nAfrica is poised to win. It has the youngest population, it has all the resources, but many of the same systemic problems we do as African Americans living here in the States.\nFrom a very young age, my dad used to take me, my brother and my sister to the record store every weekend and let us pick outwhateverwe wanted. He just wanted us to like music.\nI don’t remember a weekend when there wasn’t music playing in our house. It was all about Black music from my dad — jazz, reggae, African music, revolutionary music. My sister, who’s three years older, was the one who brought in all the other influences — punk, classic rock, Joni Mitchell, folk music. But my dad was playing topical music, because that’s what people made back then. All the songs had messages, all of them. Whether it was Steel Pulse, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, Fela Kuti. Everybody was singing about liberation.\nMy dad made me readThe Autobiography of Malcolm Xas a kid. Like, ‘You can read? Here – read this.’ So I came up thinking that music was just the platform for talking about this stuff. I started finding my own music and listening to my sister’s stuff. I loved The Smiths, and I loved Morrissey’s lyrics and Joni Mitchell’s lyrics and Jimi Hendrix’s lyrics. I even loved Nirvana and Kurt Cobain’s lyrics because these were personal lyrics. These were not necessarily about global community, but it was like, ‘How am I feeling?’ This is my journal, I can say anything I want.\nPhoto by Frank Ockenfels.\nI just played shows in Texas andFlorida, and I guarantee you some people who have completely different views than I do were at my shows. So am I going to start saying things that are going to alienate those people at my shows? Or am I going to sing my songs, which by nature are helping get some of my beliefs across while they’re vibing?\nThere are certain human needs that transcend all of that stuff. And if we can start relating on that level, we might actually find a way through this.\nI think it’s hard because back in the day they would organize a boycott forever. It would be nationwide, like ‘We’re all going to do this and it’s going to go on for this amount of time.’ But now, it’s on Instagram and you don’t even get the feed until three days later.\nOur freedom is tied up in their money. Freedom, humanity, civil rights, none of that matters because that gets in the way of making the most money possible for a few people and as long as they keep us fighting they can just keep with that agenda.\nI do believe in this day and age, the only way to have impact is through economics. Money is the only thing that talks in this government. They don’t care about the protests, they don’t care about what we post online. They care about money.\nThe current pace of life is unsustainable for everyone. And when you throw being a mother into the mix, being a creative, or just being a sentient being in this world, it’s like things are stacked against us.\nDoing shows is like being an athlete; being on the road you have to have enough sleep, you have to be eating properly, to make sure you don’t lose your voice. You can’t get sick. You have to have enough energy every night. You’re flying, so you’re on these dirty, germy planes and you’re changing time zones. Your sleep is off as you’re dealing with all that. You’re in front of all these people, managing all this energy, then come home, and it’s straight into mom mode — taking out braids, making dinner, managing schedules. There’s no exhale.\nI remember I got dropped by my business manager when I was pregnant with twins because I wasn’t making as much money. That should be illegal, but it still happens all the time.\nI really believe that every change starts with the individual and our own beliefs and things we subscribe to – we really need to start changing those definitions to fit where we want to get to.\nPhoto by Frank Ockenfels.\nI started out recognizing myself as an artist through visual art. In high school, I painted a lot and I ended up winning the Senior Studio Art Award. In college, the problem was, I was painting, I was making music and I was writing and I was having a hard time figuring out how to merge all of them. You get a creative impulse, then you get stuck because you’re like, ‘Which one do I do?’ Then you kind of freeze. I put painting aside, because I realized I could merge writing with music and so I did that.\nWhat I learned is that I’m an artist across many mediums, so I can do art all the time, even if I’m not painting. Everything I think of is from a creative perspective, whether it’s creating my stage show, which I’ve always curated – from the dancers to the costumes, the choreography to the visuals, extending to the merch. Or videos. I started directing my own videos a while back and realized music to me is visual, all I have to do is close my eyes and the whole thing just paints itself before me. It’s all right there in the music. That’s why I want to take this into film. I wrote a movie partially so I could make the costumes and do the music for it.\nThen there’s the book I’m writing. My book is a memoir, but it goes back four generations of women in my family, to my great-grandmother, my grandmother, my mother and me. There’s a lot in there about being a survivor and a Black woman and having the Strong Black Woman schema to contend with and stepping out of survival mode into a place where we feel we have permission to need support or rest or self-care.\nThat is something I’m trying to work on because I feel as a Black woman artist, there’s so much that needs to be unpacked – like even stepping outside of the oversexed persona Black women have always had as performers. It’s still so prevalent. Every new artist, they come out and the first thing you see is their ass. That shouldn’t be what you feel like you have to do.\nWalking this less trodden path where I’m not doing that and I’m leading with my art, and then with me having the tendency of working myself to death like all Black women — it’s definitely a harder path when you’re not doing what everyone else is doing — not just leading with sexuality but also making a certain kind of music that’s easily digestible or stays in the little Black Music box that you’re supposed to fit in.\nI’ve chosen a challenging road for myself. And what is success? Are you going to subscribe to other people’s versions of success that has you killing yourself and never having enough? These are things that I’ve been working through and figuring out that I don’t have to live by other people’s rules of beauty or femininity or success.

        "title": "Rediscovered: Ol' Dirty Bastard’s ‘Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version’",
        "description": "Days after unloading his maiden solo album,Ol’ Dirty Bastardcompleted his transformation from emerging rap star to a sparkling conservative talking point.\nDuring a March 30 airing of anMTV interview, the then-26-year-old jumped out of his limo to pick up food stamps and a $375 welfare check. As a member of Wu-Tang Clan, he’d already earned fame and, presumably, enough money to render food stamps into rap song vignettes — shadows of a recent past he was able to escape. But there he was collecting government-sponsored sustenance on national TV. His caseworker saw the appearance and revoked his eligibility. ODB was caught. But the thing is, “caught” suggests that he was ever hiding in the first place. In a brief, but indelible rap career, ODB eschewed pleasantries for pleasure, wisdom for weirdness, and formality for force on his way to iconhood. Released 30 years ago today,Returrn to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Versioncrystallized ODB as one of rap’s most idiosyncratic heroes — as unconventional as he was unashamed.\nIt could all be as brutal as it was whimsical. Juvenile and subtly profound. For “Goin’ Down,” he slips and slides over sinister horns and percussion that could soundtrack a dungeon, swerving into a rambunctious half-sung flow that careens into a sloppy rendition of “Over the Rainbow”; his grizzled vocals soar between a hum and a growl simultaneously. His wife makes a guest appearance for an interaction that’s as unnerving as it is raw. He maintains all the rugged randomness with “Raw Hide,” a micro-posse cut featuring Raekwon and Method Man. There, ODB lets loose bars that are as blunt as they are elementally honest. And adventurous:“Who the fuck wanna be an MCIf you can't get paid to be a fuckin' MC?I came out my mama pussy, I'm on welfareTwenty-six years old, still on welfareSo I gotta get paid fullyWhether it's truthfully or untruthfully”While ODB’s bars are rooted in real emotions and spurts of autobiography, his guttural delivery, as well as his eclectic imagination, rendered them all semi-impressionistic. One moment he’s calling an audience to party; the next, he’s imagining a “bald-headed bitch for your bald-headed wife” (“The Stomp”). RZA’s murky soundscapes — audio canvases laced with hazy piano loops and dusty brass instruments — only enhance the disorienting effect; the rumbling bassline and dazed strings of “Brooklyn Zoo II (Tiger Crane)” make ODB andGhostface Killah’s vocals feel all the more manic.With all the shouting and jagged melodies,Return to the 36 Chamberscan be abrasive. But on tracks like “Shimmy Shimmy Ya,” ODB swirls all his impulses into something mesmerizing. Skittering through a piano loop fit for an ice cream truck, ODB sounds like a sex witch doctor, turning the last syllable of each word into a melodic micro thrill: “Ooh, baby, I like it raw.” It’s a freaky adventure that’s as irresistible as it is inexplicable. What does “Shimmy Shimmy Ya” mean? I’m not even sure ODB could’ve told you. But you could feel it. You still can.While it’s a classic,Return to the 36 Chamberscan feel scattered compared to other Wu releases; as Method Mannoted on Genius, ODB actually repeated verses on the album. Even more interestingly, Meth would say most of the rhymesweren’t evenODB’s. Through this lens, the album is a mess. But that unwieldiness is exactly the point. ODB embodied the best kinds of chaos, and more important than any one or two couplets was his eccentric vocality. It’s hard not to see him in the works of quirky stylists like Young Thug, Danny Brown, and plenty of other artists who just wanted to get weird.Thirty years removed from its release,Return to the 36 Chambersstands as a masterpiece of synchronized clutter — prideful, free-wheeling and uninhibited. Glorious bars and unfortunate ones — delirious sing-song chants and coarse diatribes. Even with RZA behind the boards, it’s more the result of a spiritual reflex than meticulous craftsmanship. In a word, it was raw — just the way ODB liked it.\nIt could all be as brutal as it was whimsical. Juvenile and subtly profound.

I have the luxury of experiencing having children who I watch grow up and love and encourage very much, and I cannot separate them when I see artists who are that age coming up. That’s how they feel. They are continuing the tradition.”\nIn February, Badu won her fifth Grammy for her track \"3:AM\" withRapsody.",

The single’s video also features clips from Yaya’s times visiting Barbados. The new single is also Yaya’s first release since signing to progressive New York-based label drink sum wtr.\n“I’ve been doing a lot of international touring and constantly in places where I’m the only Black person,” she explains in a statement. “When I was in France most recently, I asked myself what it would look like to play to Black international audiences and that sort of got my wheels turning. My dad would always have at least one Reggae song on his albums. Our family is from Barbados and I continued that tradition with songs like ‘meet me in brooklyn.’ I decided I would dive even deeper with Soca and reached out to Father Philis whose music I’ve been really digging.

        "title": "Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” is a Perfect Protest Song From an Imperfect Protester",
        "description": "A month after telling the world he wasn’t their savior onMr. Morale & The Big Steppers, Kendrick Lamar used the 2022 Glastonbury festivalto cosplay as one. For his set, Kung Fu Kenny blessed the stage with his typically visceral raps and theatricality. And aniced-out crown of thorns. Embedded with 137 karats worth of diamonds, the piece turned a tragic symbol of Jesus’ persecution into a drippy, if self-serious, piece of social commentary. It was a fashion statement as much as a contradiction, the sort of tug-of-war Kendrick’s embroiled himself in since emerging in the late aughts. The good kid versus the mad city. The conscious rapper versus the gangsta rapper. “Hiii Power.” “Ignorance Is Bliss.” Released 10 years ago to the day, the jazz-inflectedTo Pimp a Butterflyrepresents the apex of Kendrick the revolutionary. And Kendrick at his most conflicted. Through this convergence of multitudes came “Alright,” a perfect protest song in a perfect moment for an imperfect time from an imperfect protester.\nTen years removed from its release, “Alright” stands as a generational rallying cry — both for us and the people who weren’t alive to hear it. Eight months beforeTo Pimp a Butterflyhit shelves and streaming services,Eric Garner diedafter a New York City police officer put him in an illegal chokehold. The next month, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict the officer in question, while the U.S. Department of Justice cleared the officer of civil rights violations.\nBut, after 400 years of injustice, we developed our own extra-judicial methods for indictment and, regardless of specifics, someone was guilty, even if the United States can’t be placed in a prison cell. As a result, we feel like we’re living in one.\nAmerican oppression is a centuries-long tradition. Garner was killed in July 2014. Emmett Till was murdered in 1955.Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killedin 2020. He was taking a jog. In 1963, just hours after John F. Kennedy gave a nationally televised speech on the importance of civil rights, Medgar Evers was shot through the heart. He was carrying shirts that read “Jim Crow Must Go.” On Feb. 26, 2012, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was approached by a 29-year-old half-Peruvian, half-white man named George Zimmerman, and after some sort of altercation, Martin was left dead on the street. Zimmerman said he looked suspicious. Black folks said the same of Zimmerman. Naturally, the story became an international controversy, especially when Zimmerman wasn’t initially arrested. It didn’t get any smaller when he was officiallyacquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter chargesin 2013. While the Black community condemned the verdict, Kendrick Lamar condemned the Black community.In the first half of Black History Month 10 years ago, Kendrick released “The Blacker the Berry,” a scorching constellation of existential defiance and soul-baring rage. For the first two verses of the song, Kendrick sneers at the demons of white supremacy, turning his hoarse shouts and blunt barbs into a tank hell-bent on destruction.”I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey / You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me,”he seethes. By the third verse, he’s turning his aggression on us — himself, Compton. Me, you. Through a barrage of searing couplets, he excoriates communities rooted in gang violence and those that would call out the white supremacy without analyzing the idea of Black on Black violence. That point spirals into a disappointingly elementary conclusion:“So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street / When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?”When Kendrick calls himself a hypocrite at the end of the song, it’s meant to be a stunning role reversal. Instead, it’s a hollow rhetorical bullet point from the respectability politics handbook. The fault isn’t in Kendrick criticizing gang violence. As someone who grew up in a MOB Piru Bloods section of Compton, he’s lost countless friends to early graves. He’s not wrong to criticize that. And neither are the innumerable church and community organizers who’ve marched and demonstrated against it at thousands of anti-violence rallies over the last 40 years. Bashing gang violence isn’t incorrect. Bashing people who bash gang violenceandwhite supremacyis. By doing so, Kendrick undermines not only his own humanity, but the spiritual endurance of Black folks everywhere. Up to that point — now, too — the wait for systemic justice has been met with the blandest, but most appropriate of cliches: “don’t hold your breath.” But we’ve held it. “Alright” was like a 3-minute and 39-second exhale.A whirlwind of exasperated fury, “Alright” isn’t a song as much as an exorcism — of the white supremacist power structure, capitalism, us, Kendrick himself. For the first verse, he unspools a vignette of national and personal purgatory, collapsing the distance between police brutality, sleepless nights and American consumerism. Kendrick delivers the couplets themselves like rounds from a Draco. The last syllable in each bar lingers like a recoil. The breathless flow feels like sprinting a marathon: “Homicide looking at you from the face down / What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down? / Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life / Painkillers only put me in the twilight / Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight.”Kendrick’s symbolism strikes the heart of a pain that spans generations of people, and perhaps iterations of yourself. His rhythms — a cascade of intermittent overflows — hit with an urgency hundreds of years in the making. Those words — those lightning bolts — fold into a refrain that bridges ages of Black plight:“Wouldn't you knowWe been hurt, been down before, niggaWhen our pride was lowLookin' at the world like, \"Where do we go?\" NiggaAnd we hate po-poWanna kill us dead in the street for sure, niggaI'm at the preacher's doorMy knees gettin' weak and my gun might blowBut we gon' be alright.”That reservoir of sensations and emotions crashes into a cathartic release of a crescendo:“Nigga, we gon' be alright.”If read without context, the line, which is delivered by a calm and cool Pharrell Williams, could scan as dismissive. Think Rico telling Ace Boogie, “Niggas get shot everyday, B.” But, within this labyrinth of feeling, it’s everything. A casual pat on the back. An extra timely, “C’mon, you got this.” We got this. Considering the perpetuity of Black tragedy, perhaps it’s best to look at the lyric as a self-assigned ultimatum: We gon’ be alright because we have to. We’ve always had to, and based on all available evidence, you can safely assume we’ll always have to.It’s a theme that’s interwoven with the very structure of the song. When Kendrick isn’t rapping his verses, the beat itself can be spare — an emptier space fit for Kendrick and Pharrell’s words to linger, like a specter for divine justice. The hook itself is simple, yet symbolic, making it a perfect call-and-response for protesters — whether here or in Palestine. Marchers invoked the song during protests for Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. If it had been released then, Martin Luther King might have led a crowd in a group chant of, “We gon’ be alright” instead of “We shall overcome.”The broadness of the track made it immortal; it’s as applicable now as it was 400 years ago, and barring an actual revolution, it will be true 400 years from now, too. It also insulated Kendrick from his own deeply flawed rhetorical tendencies. It’s the poetic equivalent of “even a broken clock is right twice a day.” Kendrick might have been wrong to say we can’t fight police injustice and gang violence at the same time, but he’s right when he says we’re all fucked up. We are. Kendrick might spew some anti-vaxxer nonsense on tracks like “N-95,” but there was — and still is — a time when our pride was low and we looked at the world like,“where do we go?”Depending on your vantage point, he can be confusing, and loving him can be… complicated.Maybe those supposed complications are only because we’re looking for perfection in the first place. Say this at the moment the internet wants you to, in the way it wants you to, or risk eternal damnation. Or even worse, being ratioed. It’s a high-wire act Kendrick has stumbled off of in moments like “The Blacker The Berry,” or when he collaborated with Kodak Black. On “Alright,” he ditches the tightrope in favor of levitation. He makes us feel like we’ll be alright, even if our mind knows we won’t.\nAmerican oppression is a centuries-long tradition. Garner was killed in July 2014.

        "title": "In Her Words: Teedra Moses On 20 Years of 'Complex Simplicity,' Loss, Motherhood and Rebirth",
        "description": "Nearly two decades after blessing the world withComplex Simplicity,Teedra Moses’s debut album still rings off like an R&B love letter. Known for her silky vocals, impeccable pen game, and an unmistakable aura of grown-woman realness, theNew Orleans-born singer-songwriter has stayed true to herself, moving independently and giving fans timeless vibes along the way. As part ofOkayplayer’scelebration ofWomen’s History Month, we’re sharing Teedra’s story In Her Words, the as-told-to story below lightly edited for length and clarity.\nOn Recognizing The Impact Of Her Debut AlbumTeedra Moses:I didn’t go intoComplex Simplicitythinking about the impact it would have. It was an indie album. I did that project with no intentions but to relieve myself of what I was going through. Just literally writing to survive… Trying to get out all this stuff that was drowning me. My mother had just died. My relationship with my children’s father had ended in a way that shattered my whole idea of what family was supposed to be. These are safeties for me that were completely gone. Shortly after that, my father died and it was just very different. All of these shifts in my life. Like an earthquake almost.It was a relief to be able to be going through what I was going through and still go on the road and exchange energy with people. I had fun but didn’t get a chance to take it in because I was just working to survive and raise kids. I feel like in this space now I can receive it because my sons are grown, wonderful young guys, creating their own lane and making music for themselves. That makes me feel proud. And then seeing friends, I say friends because these people have uplifted me in times when I felt like I wasn’t going to continue doing music. I’ve been friends with these people from that first album for over 20 years. I didn’t have any choice at this big age but to stop and take it in.Building Legacy: Family, Business and LawsuitsMy sister Tamia Moses, she’s my partner in this whole journey. She’s been with me the whole 20 years. She and I run our own business together. We own the publishing, the masters, the catalog. And I know people see headlines about how I made millions from “Dip It Low,” but they don’t talk about how I got sued.Everybody was like, ‘Oh my God Teedra you made a lot of money.’ Yeah, I lost a lot of money. This is a business that ain’t linear at all. This is over a period of time, off that one song. But when you’re making that kind of money, you think you’re gonna be able to always take care of all this stuff. It was a very expensive lesson. Legal fees alone were drowning me. I had to pay money back. My finances started to fall apart. I had two places, a place in Los Angeles in the Altadena area and I had a condo in Miami and that’s when I chose to move to Miami.I feel free because I own myself. I feel free because if you make a movie today and you want to use “Be Your Girl” remix, you have to contact me for that. You have to pay me for that on my publishing side and you have to clear the license because I own the masters clearance. We come from the era where it was like, ‘You got to get a publishing deal.’ My children’s father told me, ‘No don’t sell your publishing.’I was raised by my father, who was an entrepreneur. We’d be watching a Lakers game and he would be like, ‘Look at Magic Johnson, he’s rich – but think about how rich the man is that owns the Lakers.’ He would always say, ‘You want to be the NBA. You don’t want the money to trickle down to you.’Raising Artists: Motherhood and MusicMy sons, Ras and Taj, are my best friends. We’ve been through everything together. They’re grown now, making their own music as part of Coast Contra, but back in the day, it was just us. No solid boyfriend, no extra help — just me and them. And we were a unit.They didn’t even tell me they rapped at first. One of their friends said, ‘You know Ras and Taj rap.’ They were very shy about it And when I first heard their music, I was like, ‘Oh, my God. They’re really talented.’ But they wanted to wait until they were good enough to tell me because they knew I’d tell them the truth. When they were younger they’d go ‘Mom we’re going to be basketball players.’ No, you’re not. Regroup. I promise you’re not going to Spud Webb this situation.When they moved to L.A., they lived in a studio apartment — four grown men, each with a wall to sleep against. I think their struggle made them really come together and create chemistry.They’re also indie, which is a hard road and they know that firsthand. But we are owners, we’re not players. I told them, ‘Being indie means wearing every hat. Even when you hand that hat off, it’s still yours. You have to make sure the job gets done.’Outside of that, Coast Contra is four young men who are morally conscious and extremely talented and have a mission to speak life and I think that’s really dope.Losing Everything in the Altadena FireMy sister — my business partner, lost her home in theAltadena fire.Her house was our office, our studio. We had thousands of dollars in merch, hundreds of thousands in hard drives. We lost all those things and it was tough.My year started off crazy and I’m not used to that because I’m not in struggle mode no more. It was very scary for me, coming off last year where I allowed myself to receive flowers. It’s like a movie. Everything just got burned up. I went to bed, my sister saying they evacuated just in case. Woke up and everything had burned down. Me and my sister continued working. She was been bouncing from Airbnb to Airbnb, with two children.I believe wholeheartedly that God is always in control. If He says ‘You’re going to have to start from scratch,’ there is something beneficial in that for me and my sister. I just have to see it that way. But it took me a while.Aging Boldly, Living FullyI want to speak on aging as a woman period, but also as a woman in this business. I feel like the biggest number that the patriarchal system ever did on women was make them feel like they’re not useful as they get older. I don’t experience that at all. There’s no loss of value as you age. If anything you gain value. If you take good care of yourself and you open your mind to all the wisdom, you open your heart to all the things that come with aging, it's the best f***ing thing you’re going to do.I guess this might be important to me because my mother died at 52. So I’m going to live in this space without you putting boundaries on what I can wear, what I can say, what I can do, who I can date, any of those things. We have to lean more into our power. We can give birth to human beings. We are the incubator for life and I’m not saying anything less of those women who can’t do that. The fact that you were given the ability, whether it works or not. Don’t let anybody make you feel less than because of that, whether you’re older or younger.\nTeedra Moses:I didn’t go intoComplex Simplicitythinking about the impact it would have.

        "title": "Resilient & Proud: The Island Music Conference Grows From Strength to Strength",
        "description": "The Island Music Conference (IMC) 2025 in Kingston, Jamaica, was as much a vibe as it was an eye-opener. The annual gathering has been organized byShaggyand Sharon Burke's Solid Agency for the past 3 years. With the most recent event held last month, it finally felt like the Caribbean music scene was truly coming together and figuring out how to level up in a major way.\nSeeing artists, execs, DJs, & media folk, all in one place, tackling everything from record deals to the digital grind, was inspiring and motivating. As a media professional of Caribbean descent, I left feeling immense pride after witnessing the diaspora unite to strengthen its infrastructure and amplify its voice on the global stage. The panel discussions highlighted the complexities of navigating the modern music landscape, particularly for artists living in places with limited resources.\nPhoto Credit: Ismail “Calligrafist” SayeedObserving the non-stop hustle and dogged determination of talented Caribbean artists at this conference reminded me of the experience of young rappers in America. Young rap pioneers stateside have always had to build their own movements from scratch, fighting tooth and claw for respect and recognition every step of the way. For decades, Caribbean artists have been battling to establish a sustainable industry in the face of limited infrastructure and scant resources. The IMC provided a safe space and a supportive environment, championing Caribbean music’s contributions and honoring the often underappreciated leaders of the genre.Looking at popular music as a whole, Caribbean music has consistently exerted a profound and noticeable influence, from the rhythmic foundations of calypso and reggae to the melodic, syncopated percussions of kompa. All of these sub-genres have shaped the beats and melodies that are heard in R&B, hip-hop and popular music worldwide.DJ Kool Herc,a key figure in hip-hop's origins, has Jamaican roots, and chart-topping superstars likeRihannaand Drake have major hits built on Caribbean music. And it's not just the big names; there are countless promoters, marketing professionals, producers, dancers, engineers and songwriters of Caribbean heritage who have shaped popular music as we know it today. The IMC was about celebrating and demanding more visibility and support for these talented and resilient individuals.The panel conversations at IMC featured several highlights. One of the most insightful discussions centered around the perception of music success being solely a \"numbers game.\" This topic resonated deeply and emphasized the shared struggles of artists striving for visibility in an oversaturated market. It also touched on the competing realities between going viral online versus having real impact on the ground — and what actually generates income and entices labels or concert promoters.In essence, the IMC was a call to action, urging everyone in attendance to recognize and celebrate the Caribbean's enduring influence on global music. It delivered a renewed inspiration for delving deeper into the region's diverse musical landscape, supporting the artists, and advocating for greater recognition and equitable compensation. It served as a powerful reminder that the Caribbean's contribution to music is not just a footnote, but a fundamental element of the global soundscape.Big ups to the whole IMC crew, especially Shaggy, Sharon Burke, Francoise Blanchette, Judith Hill, and Judith Bodley for bringing us together and igniting this fire! On a personal level, this experience underlined the power of our culture and the enduring strength of our community. I'm energized to fight for our recognition, to push our sound, and to make sure the worldrespecsand acknowledges all the Caribbean vibes.\nPhoto Credit: Ismail “Calligrafist” Sayeed\nObserving the non-stop hustle and dogged determination of talented Caribbean artists at this conference reminded me of the experience of young rappers in America.

        "title": "Celebrating Roberta Flack: A Timeless Appeal That Touched Soul, Hip-Hop and Beyond",
        "description": "WhenRoberta Flackpassed away, she left behind a legacy that has shaped and reshaped popular music over the course of almost 60 years. Beginning her career as a nightclub singer who worked days as a Washington D.C. schoolteacher, Flack would go on to become one of the most successful artists of her generation. She also left an indelible impact on the one that came after her, with hip-hop constantly referencing the North Carolina native’s brilliance through samples and covers of her music.\nRoberta Flack remains transcendent: but not in the sense that it supersedes time and place. Quite the opposite — her music transcends the limitations we can often put on artists because of thewhenandwhereof their art. She was a Black woman making art at a time when Black women were constantly breaking groundandfighting battles; and the Grammy winner’s music communicated sincerity in Blackness even as she earned mainstream (i.e. white) popularity.\n“I didn’t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer – no category,” Flacksaid in 2020. “My music is my expression of what I feel and believe in a moment.”A classically trained pianist who received a full scholarship to Howard University at 15 years old, Flack, who was discovered by famed jazz pianist Les McCann, was genre-less and era-less; even in the rich and varied landscape of ’70s soul, Flack’s artistry felt unbound. So many of her songs wouldn’t have been out of place in radio rotations from 20 years earlieror20 years later. She melded soul, jazz and pop in a way that made you question why anyone had ever separated them, and her voice was a uniquely expressive instrument.The quietly graceful passion of Flack’s version of “The First Time Ever I Saw your Face” would serve as the singer, songwriter, pianist’s breakthrough; when actor and director Clint Eastwood used the song in its entirety in hisPlay Misty for Mein 1971. It had been originally released on her acclaimed debut album,First Take, released two years earlier. “…Ever I Saw Your Face” earned Flack her first Grammy. More No. 1 hits followed, like “Feel Like Makin’ Love” and Flack’s signature rendition of “Killing Me Softly With His Song” — a song that would forever connect her to hip-hop.Roberta Flack’s legacy loomed large over the generation that came of age with hip-hop in the ‘80s and ‘90s. New jack swing superstar Al B Sure! offered his own take on “Killing Me Softly” in 1988, setting the pace for the classic to be reimagined by the hip-hop generation. Of course, the most famous revisiting of “Killing Me Softly” would come almost a decade later.The Fugees' coverof “Killing Me Softly” was virtually inescapable in 1996, with Wyclef Jean hip-hop flourishes reinforcing Ms. Lauryn Hill’s beautifully emotive vocal performance. It established the Fugees as the ultimate crossover stars: a rap group that could cover a soul singer’s rendition of a pop song. And Roberta Flack herself gave them the ultimate co-sign when she performed alongside the Fugees at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards. It was a cross-generational collaboration that brought together rap Gen Xers and their Baby Boomer parents in a way that reminded all that Black music is deeply connected.The revelatory musical kinship between Roberta Flack and her frequent collaborator Donny Hathaway, set a standard for soulful duets that has never been matched. Flack and Hathaway were musical soulmates who pushed each other to truly rarified heights with performances like “Where Is The Love” and “The Closer I Get to You.” Their impeccable “Be Real Black For Me” serves as the foundation forScarface’s hood anthem “My Block,” and Beyoncé collaborated with the legendary Luther Vandross on a cover of “The Closer I Get To You.”“We were deeply connected creatively,” Flackrecalled in 2022 upon the 50th anniversary of their covers albumRoberta Flack & Donny Hathaway. “He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike [anything] I’d had before or since.”The beauty of Roberta Flack’s music was passed down to the hip-hop generation that came after her — a generation eager to take in her distinct brand of elegant soul.Roberta Flack’s music is the backbone for T.I.’s “What You Know” (1970s “Gone Away”); Lil Kim’s “Queen Bitch” (1969s “That’s No Way To Say Goodbye”); “Spring Again” by Biz Markie (“Back Together Again” from 1979; “2nd Childhood” by Nas (1983’s “Born To Love”) — and a litany of other examples.She would suffer a stroke in 2016, which left her bound to a wheelchair; and she announced in 2022 that she was battling ALS — commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease — and Flack retired from performing. It was a quiet end to a luminous career: she’d earned five Grammys, including one for Lifetime Achievement; she’d dedicated herself to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York and the Roberta Flack Foundation.“I was a teacher before I was a professional musician,” sheexplained toForbesin 2021. “My first job out of college was a teacher in the Washington DC public schools. When I considered what it meant to me to leave a legacy for future generations, I knew that meant more than just my catalog of recorded music, I wanted to provide young people with the opportunity to learn, grow and fully develop their minds. In 2006 I founded the Roberta Flack School of Music in the Bronx, which, thanks to funding from Prince, provided over 1000 children with music education for over 10 years.”Roberta Flack made an undeniable mark on all who heard her records and saw her perform. We can’t ever lose her, even as millions of fans mourn her. Her grace and soul, her passion and talent, are inspiration and motivation to the artists and fans who are still listening. She provided a template for how to be an artist in full command of one’s creativity, and that’s a legacy that’s as impactful today as it was the first time we ever heard her voice.\n“I didn’t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer – no category,” Flacksaid in 2020. “My music is my expression of what I feel and believe in a moment.”\nA classically trained pianist who received a full scholarship to Howard University at 15 years old, Flack, who was discovered by famed jazz pianist Les McCann, was genre-less and era-less; even in the rich and varied landscape of ’70s soul, Flack’s artistry felt unbound.

        "title": "Rediscovered: J Dilla’s 'Welcome 2 Detroit'",
        "description": "James “J Dilla” Yancey, aka Jay Dee, has, it’s fair to say, has finally gotten his due. The revolutionary late producer was the subject ofa recent well-received biographycalledDilla TimebyDan Charnas, and just this year his native city of Detroitgave him a dayon his birthday andnamed a street after him. There’s beenone documentaryabout him already, and another ison the way.\nThe album contains a stunning array of different genres: straight-ahead (by Dilla standards) hip-hop; techno; bossa nova; R&B; funk; African music — it’s all there. Why is this particular project so varied, in a way the producer would never attempt again?In large part, it’s because of the changing nature of the album.Welcome 2 Detroithas its genesis in a meeting in Europe between Dilla, then newly freed from his production collective The Ummah, and Peter Adarkwah, head of the small record label BBE (an acronym for “Barely Breaking Even”). BBE was at that point primarily putting out compilations, projects where they would license already-existing music, selected by a celebrity DJ. That was what Adarkwah originally wanted from Dilla, saysDilla Timeauthor Charnas.“Peter wants Jay Dee to do kind of the same thing thatKenny Dopedidfor him, a DJ-curated album,” he explains. “From that initial discussion, it became quite different.”Adarkwah had never released an album of original music before, but that was what the project morphed into. The label head visited Dilla in Detroit, and the two discovered they had common musical tastes. In particular, there was a song by the African-inspired (though actually American) group Oneness of Juju that Adarkwah played for Dilla that the latter loved, as well as jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd’s 1974 track “Think Twice.”In fact, it was that trip that cementedWelcome 2 Detroit’s shape. It had already by that point changed conception from a compilation to a collection of original beats. But the pair hanging out and trading songs in the Motor City changed everything.“The upshot of it was, when Peter Adarkwah comes to Detroit, it's going to be an instrumental record of beats,” Charnas says. “But by the end of the trip, they both realize that James can actually create a solo album, with him singing or rapping or programming beats or playing instruments.”Adarkwah’s BBE was still a small company, and could only promise a $75,000 advance. But in return, Dilla was given license to do whatever he wanted. What he wanted, it turned out, was in large part to make the kind of tracks he and the BBE founder had been listening to during their time together — both Oneness of Juju’s “African Rhythms” and “Think Twice” are covered on the project.Drummer and producer Karriem Riggins, a Detroiter as well, first befriended Dilla when Common, who Riggins was playing with at the time, came to the city to see if Dilla had beats for his 1997 album,One Day It’ll All Make Sense.A few years later, not long beforeWelcome 2 Detroit, Riggins ended up getting a call to play on a song by Dilla’s group Slum Village, “2U 4U.”“I came in and I played it and nailed it,” Riggins remembers. “He had ideas of wanting to do more music with live drums. So that time span from [Slum Village’sFantastic Vol. 2] toWelcome 2 Detroit, wheels were turning on how he could incorporate me on other things.“Then he met Peter Adarkwah, and I think Peter's direction was that he wanted Dilla to do live-oriented music and covers. It was supposed to be a covers album, from what I was told.”So we have a wide-open blueprint and a virtuosic drummer, soon to be joined by singer/songwriter Dwele. For the rap tracks, a mix of Dilla’s Detroit pals came on board — Phat Kat, Elzhi, Frank’n’Dank — alongside the beatmaker himself.“He decided that he was going to be generous with his Detroit friends and put them on,” Charnas explains. “He had a whole stable of folks foryearswho wanted to get on Jay Dee beat, and so here’s the chance.”The sessions for the record involved a lot of live instrumentation, much of it played by Dilla.“He was stacking those songs the way Stevie Wonder recorded,” Riggins says. “He would lay the drums, when he played on “Think Twice,” that's track for track. He did the kick first, and then he did the hi-hat, and then he did the cymbal swells and all of that, the different nuances. Then he did the keys. Then he called Dwele to come in to do the horns. And then he sang it. It was a process of a few sessions to create certain songs.”Riggins played drums on several tracks, and even got one of his beats on there too (“The Clapper”) — no small feat when one of the all-time greatest beatmakers has his name on the cover.“That was the first beat that I ever placed — something that I created from scratch on a drum machine inspired by my favorite producer,” he says. “And he purchases the beat and gives me a shot at being a producer. That was the highest honor.”Welcome 2 Detroitis unique in Dilla’s output. Charnas, who knows the producer’s discography as well as anyone, agrees that he never made a single album as diverse ever again.“I think he tried withThe Shining, which was the second BBE album,” the author says. “But he was very sick at the time, and the sessions were few and far between, and Karriem had to finish that album on his own.“So that's whyWelcome 2 Detroitis really, really special. I think his plans forPay Jay, what becameThe Diaryin later years, were straight hip-hop, with him rhyming. I think it is absolutely the most diverse offering from Jay Dee. No question about it.”And yet, somehow, the multi-genre project feels cohesive. To Riggins, who recently released atribute track to Dilla, it’s because that was just who he was.“My first time going to his basement, I was pulling out records and discovering things that I had never discovered about people that I grew up listening to,” he recalls, with wonder still in his voice. “Elvin Jones is one of my favorite drummers, and I pull out a record that I never heard of Elvin’s. That was crazy.“I learned aboutMutinythrough him, and a lot of prog rock stuff. He was heavy on prog rock, heavy on jazz and Afrobeat, all of those things.“I feel like you are what you listen to, just like you are what you eat. He just bled everything that was in him on that record.”Charnas sees it as a high point in the producer’s career.“It's an act of generosity. It really is,” he says. “It's a miracle album. And it's a great time capsule of Dilla at his creative apex.”\nThe album contains a stunning array of different genres: straight-ahead (by Dilla standards) hip-hop; techno; bossa nova; R&B; funk; African music — it’s all there. Why is this particular project so varied, in a way the producer would never attempt again?\nIn large part, it’s because of the changing nature of the album.Welcome 2 Detroithas its genesis in a meeting in Europe between Dilla, then newly freed from his production collective The Ummah, and Peter Adarkwah, head of the small record label BBE (an acronym for “Barely Breaking Even”).

For the rap tracks, a mix of Dilla’s Detroit pals came on board — Phat Kat, Elzhi, Frank’n’Dank — alongside the beatmaker himself.\n\nThe sessions for the record involved a lot of live instrumentation, much of it played by Dilla.\n“He was stacking those songs the way Stevie Wonder recorded,” Riggins says. “He would lay the drums, when he played on “Think Twice,” that's track for track. He did the kick first, and then he did the hi-hat, and then he did the cymbal swells and all of that, the different nuances. Then he did the keys. Then he called Dwele to come in to do the horns. And then he sang it. It was a process of a few sessions to create certain songs.”\nRiggins played drums on several tracks, and even got one of his beats on there too (“The Clapper”) — no small feat when one of the all-time greatest beatmakers has his name on the cover.\n“That was the first beat that I ever placed — something that I created from scratch on a drum machine inspired by my favorite producer,” he says. “And he purchases the beat and gives me a shot at being a producer. That was the highest honor.”\nWelcome 2 Detroitis unique in Dilla’s output. Charnas, who knows the producer’s discography as well as anyone, agrees that he never made a single album as diverse ever again.\n“I think he tried withThe Shining, which was the second BBE album,” the author says. “But he was very sick at the time, and the sessions were few and far between, and Karriem had to finish that album on his own.\n“So that's whyWelcome 2 Detroitis really, really special. I think his plans forPay Jay, what becameThe Diaryin later years, were straight hip-hop, with him rhyming. I think it is absolutely the most diverse offering from Jay Dee. No question about it.”\nAnd yet, somehow, the multi-genre project feels cohesive. To Riggins, who recently released atribute track to Dilla, it’s because that was just who he was.\n“My first time going to his basement, I was pulling out records and discovering things that I had never discovered about people that I grew up listening to,” he recalls, with wonder still in his voice. “Elvin Jones is one of my favorite drummers, and I pull out a record that I never heard of Elvin’s. That was crazy.\n“I learned aboutMutinythrough him, and a lot of prog rock stuff. He was heavy on prog rock, heavy on jazz and Afrobeat, all of those things.\n“I feel like you are what you listen to, just like you are what you eat. He just bled everything that was in him on that record.”\nCharnas sees it as a high point in the producer’s career.\n“It's an act of generosity. It really is,” he says. “It's a miracle album. And it's a great time capsule of Dilla at his creative apex.”",

        "title": "The 26 Best Tyler, the Creator Songs",
        "description": "Tyler, The Creatoris a household name today, selling out arena tours and bringing the vision he had of himself as a kid to life. He went from being an artist who would have never been able to havehis music playedon BET, to having one of the best performances in BET's history when he performed his single \"Lumberjack\"in 2021. Today, more than ten years into his music career, he has become one of the mostimpactful artistsof a generation. He has inspired a whole generation of indie, alternative, or weird Black people who describes themselves as creative.\nSince he released his breakout mixtape,Bastard, in 2009, Tyler has dropped six official albums. He has also made countless guest appearances, gifting listeners an escape through his songs.\nLooking back at his catalogue, here are the 26 best Tyler, the Creator songs of all time.\n\nA$AP Rocky and Tyler, the Creator complement each other so well musically. So when they come together for a feature or a loosey it's like they are trying to outdo one another every chance they get. On \"Potato Salad,\" Tyler is out-rapping Rocky, which he usually does. His wordplay is10/10 on here, and it shows the skills he has honed as an MC over the years.\n\n\"Come On, Let’s Go\"is one of the stand-out songs fromI Know NIGO!This is a track that shows all of Tyler's best qualities as a producer, rapper, big flexer, and overall song maker. Although this song spotlights his rapping abilities, it still can make an entire crowd dance.\n\n\nCollaborating with one of your biggest inspirations is no small feat. Here, Tyler and Pharrell team up to make another song on one of Tyler’s favorite topics: loving someone so much that you have no choice but to hurt them.This song — andWolfas a whole — showed Tyler in a different light as an artist and opened the doors for what was to come next.\n\nEarly Tyler was unique. His debut,Bastard,was his introduction to the music world, and \"VCR\"was the start of something wild.However jarring it sounds to hear a young Tyler rap about harming someone in this way (TW: sexual assault), it’s not much of a deviation from later songs like \"She\"and \"IFHY\"Hearing this today in the context of a \"Blow My Load,\" you can tell that \"VCR\"was the precursor for what was coming next for his production abilities.\n\n\n\"Anwser\" feels like you are listening to a therapy session from somebody trying to understand not having a relationship with an absent parent. In the second verse, he is still coming to terms with the passing of his grandmother who was such an important force in his life. Add the lyrics and feeling to the melancholy beat and you will feel like you’re going through it with him.\n\n\nCherry Bombis a deviation from his past albums; here he has a real motivational presence. On \"Okaga, CA,\" it feels like he is wanting an infinite ending to everything happening in life. Despite how the words sound, the beat,produced by Tylerof course, sounds the same way a sunset looks. This being the ending of his most experimental album, makes so much sense to what he ended up doing with his next projects.\n\n\nTyler is no stranger to putting multiple songs into one track.On \"Bimmer,\" — 1/3 of \"PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer\" — he is showing how he falls fast for whoever he is liking at the time ofWolfand what will happen if they happen to go any further than what they are currently doing. A real classic love song.\n\nThe seventh song on Tyler’s third studio album is all about cunnilingus and climaxing — over some of the most beautiful production you'll ever hear. Tyler opens the song with a textbook situationship quote — \"it’s never the love, it’s always the sex.\" On top of the lyrics being straight to the point the second the song starts, its accompanied by crescendoing piano chords and Wayna’s iconic runs sound like they are inside the beat matching the feeling of what it is like to blow a load.\n\nAt thetime ofFlower Boy, Tyler was fully coming into himself as a person and an artist. In those times of finding yourself, it can be extremely isolating. The first half of \"911\"is a dance track where he is asking for a call from his current love interest at the time. As the dancing dwindles withSteve Lacypleading for them to bang his line, Tyler comes in again, with a self-reflective verse about his need to create the worlds he does on his albums.\n\nCherry Bombwas the moment Tyler was fully experimental with his music. On \"Find Your Wings\" he was able to show the range he not only has as a rapper and artist but as a producer and a composer.\n\nFalling in love is one of the most exciting feelings. It also happens to be one of the emotions Tyler conveys perfectly in his music. \"I Think,\"from his fourth studio album,IGOR,makes a compelling argument over a great dance track. What better way to feel love than to dance through it? The song is perfectly executed and the beat and the backing vocals paint the perfect picture for when you are falling in love and the only thing you can think of is the person you’re yearning to be with.\n\n\n\"She\" is about liking a girl so much that if she ever decides to say no, it’s over for her. Aside from the subject matter, the potential is clear in young Tyler’s production. The message of the song gets a pass because of the beat. Tyler put these unnerving lyrics on top of mythical production that makes you feel like romance.\n\n“Awww you look malnourished,” is one of the craziest ways to approach the person you’re interested in. But Tyler did it and made a hit. With Ty Dolla $ign andNBA Young Boyas accouterment, this s song further amplifies Tyler’s talents as a composer. Who would have thought that Tyler and Young Boy would come together to make a great song about trying to take your crush out away from their partner?\n\n\nCALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, the album that brought backGangsta Grillz tapes,is a diary. Tyler is expressing the love he lost when the person he was falling in love with chose her boyfriend instead of him.He’s an expert at telling stories of unrequited love and longing for a relationship that can’t happen and nothing is different here. It's the right person at the wrong time. In the eight minutes, he tells the story of meeting his friend’s girlfriend with the long legs, good ears, and great taste and the fact they are perfectly made for one another.\n\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nA loosie that never received a proper release, “Hey You” came when Tyler and Toro Y Moi were at their respective peaks in the early 2010s. With Toro’s lush and wavy production driving the track, Tyler channels his inner smooth talker and delivers a simple and memorable hook. Never have the words “It sounds cool to me” sounded as cool as they do here.\n\n“I’m that ni**a and that b**ch” may be the best pronoun punchline bar we’ll ever get. But even after Tyler utters those words, “Sticky” just gets better and better with each second. It’s a West Coast and Southern rap affair, with Tyler enlisting GloRilla, Sexyy Red and Lil Wayne for slick features that meld well in Tyler’sCHROMAKOPIAera.\n\nThere are many songs you can point to throughout Tyler’s career that signal him being a devout student of The Neptunes School of Music, and “Darling, I” is surely one of those examples. It channels the odes to love found particularly on Pharrell’s In My Mind solo album, but unlike the unabashed declarations of love you’ll find on there (“Angel,” for instance), “Darling, I” goes for something more complex: a cherishing of a love that may never last a lifetime, as well as the contradicting feelings one may have when it comes to love.\n\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nYou can’t go wrong with a sample of Cortex’s \"Huit Octobre 1971.\" With this sample-friendly cut serving as the basis for “Odd Toddlers,” Tyler and Casey Veggies share boastful raps, with the former offering this slightly prophetic declaration that’s become a reality throughout his career: “I should win a f**king award for being me.”\n\nWhat really sticks out about “Noid” is its production. As the first single from CHROMAKOPIA, “Noid” and its Ngozi Family-sampling production is dynamic and explosive, a powerful compliment to Tyler’s paranoia-informed raps throughout the track. As St. Chroma, his latest musical persona, Tyler’s fear gets the best of him, his want for privacy leading to drastic measures. Is it a commentary on how hard privacy is to maintain in the social media age? His continued frustration with navigating the visibility that comes with fame? It’s up for debate. What isn’t, is how good of a song it is.\n“Analog” is something of a palette cleanser as Goblin nears its end. Despite delivering their lyrics with pitched-down menace, Tyler and Hodgy Beats are on their best behavior, both chasing summertime flings with no ulterior motives looming behind their innocent desire to end the day watching the sunset.\nOn “Dogtooth,” Tyler elevates hip-hop’s brag game. Sure, it’s great to have the cool whips. But are you a weirdo when it comes to women? Are you mindful of their pleasure or only concerned about your own? There’s little nuggets throughout this track that speak to these questions, culminating in some great words of wisdom from Tyler: Ni**as tellin' women how they bodies supposed to be, but / Never take advice from any ni**a with a lean gut.”\nAs the closer for his deluxe version of CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, Tyler extends apologies to everyone from his mother to the Earth as reckons with past and present wrongs. There’s notable tells that don’t get expounded upon — friendships ruined by egos, navigating his sexuality — with Tyler only offering as much as he’s willing to share. It’s not a stretch to presume that the brags that defineCALL MEcame from challenges and sacrifices Tyler had to make — both to himself and others. “Sorry Not Sorry” is a poignant testament to that.\n\"Lone\" would essentially mark the end of a trilogy withBastard,GoblinandWolf,with Tyler having his final therapy session with Dr. TC, presumed to be his therapist throughout the trilogy but revealed to be nothing more than a part of Tyler’s conscience. “Lone” channels preceding album-ending sessions like “Golden” and “Inglorious,” but it’s clear that there’s some levity unlike before. The production trades the moody and dour sounds that defined past sessions for something more lush, as Tyler revels in the success he’s gained, while navigating the challenges that come with such fame, as well as grieving the passing of his grandmother.\nA loosie that seemingly takes its name from the song it samples (Saint Etienne’s “4:35 in the Morning”), “435” is a “one take” rap-off where Tyler brags about wanting to take jet flights and aspiring to get more than one Grammy nomination at the annual music-honoring ceremony. It’s the type of song that would’ve fit perfectly inCALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, but is still just as great on its own.\n\nIn the lead single fromIGOR, Tyleramplifies the feeling of falling for someone and them shaking your entire world up. Beyond this song being one of his most popular releases, he gives us the relatable feelings of the world around you being ruined by falling in love.\n\n\"2Seater\"is Tyler combining his flex abilities with his love for cars and sharing that with his love interest. Beyond the subject matter, here he is really showing his skills as an artist in all ways. He is rapping his ass off when talking about pushing 100mph down Fairfax Avenue and the memories that accompany the strip. The production, like much ofCherry Bomb, sounds like an intro to an old Hollywood movie. It builds up to a climactic moment which happens to be the music ending and transitioning to a love song. On top of that, this is a song where you can hear more of Tyler’s confidence as an artist. (He was singing without using any effects on his voice.) This is a song that encompasses all of the strong qualities of Tyler as an artist.\n__\nNia Coats is an independent journalist located in the Bay Area who covers topics on music, culture, and life.

        "title": "Rediscovered: The Roots, 'Things Fall Apart'",
        "description": "February 2025 marks 26 years since the release of The Roots’ 1999 studio album,Things Fall Apart. That year also saw thelaunch of Okayplayer.com. Initially conceived as an online home for The Roots, Okayplayer quickly grew into a haven for a community of fans, musicians and budding journalists who’d coalesced around the band.\nIt’s fitting that the group named their breakout album after Chinua Achibe’s 1958 novel,Things Fall Apart. Much like Achibe’s exploration of Nigeria under the yoke of British control in the 1890s,Things Fall Apart, the album asks important questions about the nature of community and culture. What happens when a community or a culture is threatened by outside, alien forces? Why do the victims of those incursions so often turn their trauma into pathology? How can a strong and functioning sense of community protect against encroachment and oppression? Obviously, there are no sure answers to any of these questions, but what we are left with is a snapshot of a band and a culture in transition. Chinua Achibe’s novel demanded that its protagonists hold onto their cultural customs in the wake of the arrival of Europeans who sought to destroy them,Things Fall Apartraises a similar call to hip-hop culture. As with any art form that comes into contact with capitalism, hip-hop in 1999 found itself being pulled by the opposing forces of creativity and profit. In the wake of rap music’s emergence as a commercial force, it further distanced itself from the culture that produced it.Despite their present standing as one of hip-hop’s most beloved legacy acts, The Roots have always been an anomaly in the genre. By the time the band’s founders, drummer Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson and rapper Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter met at Philadelphia School for Creative and Performing Arts in 1987, the very idea of a live hip-hop band was a novelty. While The Roots — who were going by the name “Black to the Future” at the time — would go on to become hip-hop’s most significant live band, they were not its first. Contrary to popular myths about early hip-hop emerging as a result of a lack of musical training and education among the inner-city youth, live instrumentation has been a part of the music since the first rap records were made. In 1979 the first wave of rap records like Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” Lady B’s “To The Beat Y’all,” and Spoonie Gee’s “Spoonin Rap” and more were made by using live bands to recreate grooves similar to the records that the DJs were playing at the hip-hop jams.The difference between these bands and The Roots is that these bands were made up of musicians who’d been recruited by the label to do session work. The Roots were a self-contained ensemble who wrote their own material in the studio and built their reputation on the road. As the ‘80s gave way to the ‘90s, hip-hop production was dominated by gritty, sample-based production crafted on machines like the EMU SP1200, and AKAI’s S-950 and MPCs series. On stage, the turntable still reigned supreme with the majority of live rap performances consisting of an MC or group rocking with a DJ playing instrumental versions of their songs. With the exception of Brooklyn-born sextet, Stetsasonic — who released their final album Blood Sweat & No Tears in 1991, nearly four years before The Roots’ major label debut — The Roots seemed to be constantly swimming against hip-hop prevailing sound and aesthetic.Seemingly at odds with mainstream rap music, The Roots still found success in the early part of their career. Their albums were never big sellers butDo You Want More?!!!??!and 1996’sIlladelph Halflifereceived critical acclaim earning a four and four and a half mics in The Source magazine’s coveted five-mic review rating system. Outside of The Source, The Roots were generally perceived as critical darlings who had yet to hit upon a sound that would translate into commercial success. WhenThings Fall Apartwas released on Feb. 23, 1999, hip-hop was enjoying a cozy, new relationship with corporate America. The genre had fully integrated itself into mainstream pop culture with artists like Jay-Z, DMX, Will Smith, Lauryn Hill and many more releasing massive sellers the years prior. In this era of the rap blockbuster, the pressure for major label hip-hop acts to strike gold — preferably platinum — on the charts had never been higher. As an outlier in rap, this pressure to sell records was even more pronounced when it came to Thompson, Trotter and The Roots. For rap acts, the unlikely feat of selling millions of records often came at the expense of their artistic vision and often required a “softening” of an artist’s sound or a compromise of their creative ambitions. As the last standing hip-hop band, who made music that did not readily fit into the sound that ruled commercial radio, The Roots were fighting a war on multiple fronts. At its core,Things Fall Aparttells us that The Roots were both anxious about their place in hip-hop as well as hip-hop’s place in mainstream culture.\"We had given most of our adult lives to that point to the band. What if success never came to us, or never came in the form we expected? — Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson from Mo’ Metta Blues: The World According to Questlove.Spike Lee’s 1990 musical drama Mo’ Better Blues follows an emerging, contemporary jazz trumpeter and his struggle to uphold the integrity of the music in the face of exploitative club owners, interpersonal strife within his band and fickle audience tastes.Things Fall Apartopens with a sampled bit of dialogue from the film that speaks to the state of The Roots as a commercial and creative entity and their place within hip-hop. Bandmates Bleek Gilliam (played by Denzel Washington) and Shadow Henderson (played by Wesley Snipes) debate the nature of Black art and creativity in a world where serious Black art is undervalued, even by Black audiences.“But we don’t even come to see our own, man… If we had to depend on Black people to eat, we’d starve to death,” Bleek deadpans coldly, while a collage of brief musical moments sampled from The Roots’ prior release appears and dissipates in spurts in the background.Shadow counters Bleek’s assessment and makes the argument for a populist approach to art.“Bullshit! It’s all bullshit. The people don’t come because you grandiose muthafuckas don’t play shit that they like. If you played the shit that they liked, then the people would come, simple as that!”To settle this debate, The Roots turn to none other than Public Enemy’s media assassin, Harry Allen. In a clip taken from the 1996 NPR audio documentaryHip Hop 101: On The Road With The Roots, Allen offers a succinct diagnosis of the problem that ails Shadow and Bleek, The Roots and Black artists everywhere:“Inevitably, hip-hop records are treated as though they are disposable. They’re not maximized as product … not to mention, as art.”This dynamic dance between the group’s artistic vision and commercial ambitions is examined and explored throughout the album’s run time. Songs like the opener, “Table Of Contents”, “The Next Movement” and “Step Into the Realm” recall the bright, jazz-rap ofDo You Want More?!!!??!and some of the darker, street-oriented album cuts fromIlladelph Halflife. Veterans of both the stage and studio by this point, the group possessed the skill to revisit some of the musical terrain they had traveled in the past while experimenting with new sonic avenues.The jaunty, jazz-guitar-driven standout, “Dynamite!” benefited from blistering guest verses from ELO The Cosmic Eye and a beat produced by J Dilla. “Dynamite!” marked one of the first times The Roots employed a track produced by someone outside of the band and its inner circle, proving that the band could find power by tapping into the broader community of musicians around them. Foreshadowing the collective approach that gaveThings Fall Apartpart of its core identity,Things Fall Apart’sgreatest success came through collaboration and the unlikely union of the experimental and the accessible.“You Got Me” wasThings Fall Apart’s lead single and is to date, The Roots' biggest single. With an instrumental composed by keyboardist/producer, and former bandmember, Scott Storch, a chorus penned by the up-and-coming singer and poet, Jill Scott, and sung by “neo-soul” goddess Erykah Badu, “You Got Me” is a melancholic rap ballad about a romantic relationship in turmoil. Bittersweet and undeniably catchy, “You Got Me” made waves on the radio and served as a perfect setup forThings Fall Apart. Toward the end of the song, Questlove throws a curveball by playing a skittering, double-time drum beat, tipping his hat to the U.K. drum n’ bass sound that the band had been exposed to while living in London in the summer of 1994.Another key element to “You Got Me”’s appeal was a guest verse from West Philly-born rapper, Eve (billed here as Eve of Destruction). Along with future stars, Bilal, India Arie, and Musiq Soulchild, Eve made her way into The Roots’ orbit by attending the now-storied jam sessions at Questlove’s house at 23rd and St. Albans Street in South Philly.With theThings Fall Apartsessions underway and a teeming community of artists around them, an unlikely set of circumstances would bring gifted South Philly MC, Beanie Sigel into the fold to record his classic debut verse on the song “Adrenaline!” At age six, Trotter accidentally burned down his family’s house in Philly’s Mt. Airy section, forcing the Trotter clan to relocate to South Philly. There, Trotter and Sigel met during their elementary school years, became friends, and performed in a group together. In the summer of 1996, Beanie Sigel began working with MC/Producer, Shawn “Air Smooth” White of the group Divine Beings on a series of demo songs in hopes of securing a record deal. Not only did White provide Sigel with a space to record, he had a crucial connection with Sigel’s long-lost childhood friend, Black Thought. Thought had met White and the Divine Beings crew at the legendary Philly hip-hop showcase,Rap Underground North, and the two got close. When The Roots were recordingThings Fall Apart, Black Thought was surprised to find out that his old friend Beanie Sigel was the brilliant new MC that White had been working with and raving about. With Black Thought, Beanie, Dice Raw and Malik B playing an increasingly intense game of lyrical one-upmanship, the song plays out like a four-way death match between a handful of the city’s most elite MCs. Peppered with guest performances from D’Angelo, The Jazzyfatnastees, Common, Ursula Rucker, Yasiin Bey, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Lady B,Things Fall Apart’s tracklist reflects just how connected the anomalous band from Philly actually was.It was the strength of the album’s collaborations and the band’s artistic community that drove it to achieve the commercial success that had eluded them up until that point. “You Got Me” went on to win a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and earned the band a gold plaque for 500,000 copies sold in April ‘99. On the eve of the album’s release, The Roots launched another project that would further build upon the community they’d marshaled forThings Fall Apart and change the landscape of internet culture. Okayplayer.com was designed by writer and Philly native, Angela Nissel. Thompson initially conceived of it as a website for The Roots, but Nissel and Roots member, Rahzel had a broader vision for the site as an online community for fans and artists. A few years prior, artists like the Beastie Boys and Oakland rap crew Hieroglyphics launched popular sites that allowed them to communicate directly with their fans. It was clear that the future of the music business would require artists to maintain a direct line of communication with fans via the Internet. The brilliance, humor, knowledge and hubris that users brought enlivened the Okayplayer message boards. This energy helped The Roots build on the community that they had cultivated throughout the making of Things Fall Apart and beyond.Today, The Roots enjoy a rare status among hip-hop acts. Having navigated a veritable minefield of industrial and cultural shifts, The Roots are now a paragon of longevity in hip-hop. As the breakout release that proved that the band could tastefully dance between creativity and commercial appeal,Things Fall Aparthelped make The Roots a viable entity. Nearly 2 years afterThings Fall Apart’s release, the group served as the backing band for Jay-Z’s landmark MTV Unplugged album. By recreating the biggest hits by the biggest rapper in the world, The Roots not only displayed their versatility, they proved the accessibility of the sound that once made them outsiders. With over a dozen albums, tours, festivals, films, and their nightly gig supporting Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, The Roots’ penetration into popular culture would’ve been impossible to predict back in 1999. The odds-defying feat that The Roots pulled off has not only served the band, it changed how Black hip-hop artists could exist in the music business. Looking back 26 years later, Black artists from Little Brother and Pink Siifu to Kendrick Lamar and Liv.e and countless others have directly benefitted from the musical space that The Roots carved out. Ultimately, things did not fall apart for The Roots. By sticking to their guns and nurturing a community around them, The Roots not only created a classic, they made it easier for all of the mavericks and outliers who came after them.\nIt’s fitting that the group named their breakout album after Chinua Achibe’s 1958 novel,Things Fall Apart. Much like Achibe’s exploration of Nigeria under the yoke of British control in the 1890s,Things Fall Apart, the album asks important questions about the nature of community and culture. What happens when a community or a culture is threatened by outside, alien forces? Why do the victims of those incursions so often turn their trauma into pathology? How can a strong and functioning sense of community protect against encroachment and oppression? Obviously, there are no sure answers to any of these questions, but what we are left with is a snapshot of a band and a culture in transition. Chinua Achibe’s novel demanded that its protagonists hold onto their cultural customs in the wake of the arrival of Europeans who sought to destroy them,Things Fall Apartraises a similar call to hip-hop culture. As with any art form that comes into contact with capitalism, hip-hop in 1999 found itself being pulled by the opposing forces of creativity and profit. In the wake of rap music’s emergence as a commercial force, it further distanced itself from the culture that produced it.\nDespite their present standing as one of hip-hop’s most beloved legacy acts, The Roots have always been an anomaly in the genre. By the time the band’s founders, drummer Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson and rapper Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter met at Philadelphia School for Creative and Performing Arts in 1987, the very idea of a live hip-hop band was a novelty. While The Roots — who were going by the name “Black to the Future” at the time — would go on to become hip-hop’s most significant live band, they were not its first. Contrary to popular myths about early hip-hop emerging as a result of a lack of musical training and education among the inner-city youth, live instrumentation has been a part of the music since the first rap records were made. In 1979 the first wave of rap records like Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” Lady B’s “To The Beat Y’all,” and Spoonie Gee’s “Spoonin Rap” and more were made by using live bands to recreate grooves similar to the records that the DJs were playing at the hip-hop jams.\nThe difference between these bands and The Roots is that these bands were made up of musicians who’d been recruited by the label to do session work. The Roots were a self-contained ensemble who wrote their own material in the studio and built their reputation on the road. As the ‘80s gave way to the ‘90s, hip-hop production was dominated by gritty, sample-based production crafted on machines like the EMU SP1200, and AKAI’s S-950 and MPCs series. On stage, the turntable still reigned supreme with the majority of live rap performances consisting of an MC or group rocking with a DJ playing instrumental versions of their songs. With the exception of Brooklyn-born sextet, Stetsasonic — who released their final album Blood Sweat & No Tears in 1991, nearly four years before The Roots’ major label debut — The Roots seemed to be constantly swimming against hip-hop prevailing sound and aesthetic.\nSeemingly at odds with mainstream rap music, The Roots still found success in the early part of their career. Their albums were never big sellers butDo You Want More?!!!??!and 1996’sIlladelph Halflifereceived critical acclaim earning a four and four and a half mics in The Source magazine’s coveted five-mic review rating system. Outside of The Source, The Roots were generally perceived as critical darlings who had yet to hit upon a sound that would translate into commercial success. WhenThings Fall Apartwas released on Feb. 23, 1999, hip-hop was enjoying a cozy, new relationship with corporate America. The genre had fully integrated itself into mainstream pop culture with artists like Jay-Z, DMX, Will Smith, Lauryn Hill and many more releasing massive sellers the years prior. In this era of the rap blockbuster, the pressure for major label hip-hop acts to strike gold — preferably platinum — on the charts had never been higher. As an outlier in rap, this pressure to sell records was even more pronounced when it came to Thompson, Trotter and The Roots. For rap acts, the unlikely feat of selling millions of records often came at the expense of their artistic vision and often required a “softening” of an artist’s sound or a compromise of their creative ambitions. As the last standing hip-hop band, who made music that did not readily fit into the sound that ruled commercial radio, The Roots were fighting a war on multiple fronts. At its core,Things Fall Aparttells us that The Roots were both anxious about their place in hip-hop as well as hip-hop’s place in mainstream culture.\nSpike Lee’s 1990 musical drama Mo’ Better Blues follows an emerging, contemporary jazz trumpeter and his struggle to uphold the integrity of the music in the face of exploitative club owners, interpersonal strife within his band and fickle audience tastes.Things Fall Apartopens with a sampled bit of dialogue from the film that speaks to the state of The Roots as a commercial and creative entity and their place within hip-hop. Bandmates Bleek Gilliam (played by Denzel Washington) and Shadow Henderson (played by Wesley Snipes) debate the nature of Black art and creativity in a world where serious Black art is undervalued, even by Black audiences.\n“But we don’t even come to see our own, man… If we had to depend on Black people to eat, we’d starve to death,” Bleek deadpans coldly, while a collage of brief musical moments sampled from The Roots’ prior release appears and dissipates in spurts in the background.\nShadow counters Bleek’s assessment and makes the argument for a populist approach to art.\n“Bullshit! It’s all bullshit. The people don’t come because you grandiose muthafuckas don’t play shit that they like. If you played the shit that they liked, then the people would come, simple as that!”\nTo settle this debate, The Roots turn to none other than Public Enemy’s media assassin, Harry Allen. In a clip taken from the 1996 NPR audio documentaryHip Hop 101: On The Road With The Roots, Allen offers a succinct diagnosis of the problem that ails Shadow and Bleek, The Roots and Black artists everywhere:\n“Inevitably, hip-hop records are treated as though they are disposable. They’re not maximized as product … not to mention, as art.”This dynamic dance between the group’s artistic vision and commercial ambitions is examined and explored throughout the album’s run time. Songs like the opener, “Table Of Contents”, “The Next Movement” and “Step Into the Realm” recall the bright, jazz-rap ofDo You Want More?!!!??!and some of the darker, street-oriented album cuts fromIlladelph Halflife. Veterans of both the stage and studio by this point, the group possessed the skill to revisit some of the musical terrain they had traveled in the past while experimenting with new sonic avenues.\nThe jaunty, jazz-guitar-driven standout, “Dynamite!” benefited from blistering guest verses from ELO The Cosmic Eye and a beat produced by J Dilla. “Dynamite!” marked one of the first times The Roots employed a track produced by someone outside of the band and its inner circle, proving that the band could find power by tapping into the broader community of musicians around them. Foreshadowing the collective approach that gaveThings Fall Apartpart of its core identity,Things Fall Apart’sgreatest success came through collaboration and the unlikely union of the experimental and the accessible.\n“You Got Me” wasThings Fall Apart’s lead single and is to date, The Roots' biggest single. With an instrumental composed by keyboardist/producer, and former bandmember, Scott Storch, a chorus penned by the up-and-coming singer and poet, Jill Scott, and sung by “neo-soul” goddess Erykah Badu, “You Got Me” is a melancholic rap ballad about a romantic relationship in turmoil. Bittersweet and undeniably catchy, “You Got Me” made waves on the radio and served as a perfect setup forThings Fall Apart. Toward the end of the song, Questlove throws a curveball by playing a skittering, double-time drum beat, tipping his hat to the U.K. drum n’ bass sound that the band had been exposed to while living in London in the summer of 1994.\n\nWith theThings Fall Apartsessions underway and a teeming community of artists around them, an unlikely set of circumstances would bring gifted South Philly MC, Beanie Sigel into the fold to record his classic debut verse on the song “Adrenaline!” At age six, Trotter accidentally burned down his family’s house in Philly’s Mt. Airy section, forcing the Trotter clan to relocate to South Philly. There, Trotter and Sigel met during their elementary school years, became friends, and performed in a group together. In the summer of 1996, Beanie Sigel began working with MC/Producer, Shawn “Air Smooth” White of the group Divine Beings on a series of demo songs in hopes of securing a record deal. Not only did White provide Sigel with a space to record, he had a crucial connection with Sigel’s long-lost childhood friend, Black Thought. Thought had met White and the Divine Beings crew at the legendary Philly hip-hop showcase,Rap Underground North, and the two got close. When The Roots were recordingThings Fall Apart, Black Thought was surprised to find out that his old friend Beanie Sigel was the brilliant new MC that White had been working with and raving about. With Black Thought, Beanie, Dice Raw and Malik B playing an increasingly intense game of lyrical one-upmanship, the song plays out like a four-way death match between a handful of the city’s most elite MCs. Peppered with guest performances from D’Angelo, The Jazzyfatnastees, Common, Ursula Rucker, Yasiin Bey, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Lady B,Things Fall Apart’s tracklist reflects just how connected the anomalous band from Philly actually was.\nIt was the strength of the album’s collaborations and the band’s artistic community that drove it to achieve the commercial success that had eluded them up until that point. “You Got Me” went on to win a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and earned the band a gold plaque for 500,000 copies sold in April ‘99. On the eve of the album’s release, The Roots launched another project that would further build upon the community they’d marshaled forThings Fall Apart and change the landscape of internet culture. Okayplayer.com was designed by writer and Philly native, Angela Nissel. Thompson initially conceived of it as a website for The Roots, but Nissel and Roots member, Rahzel had a broader vision for the site as an online community for fans and artists. A few years prior, artists like the Beastie Boys and Oakland rap crew Hieroglyphics launched popular sites that allowed them to communicate directly with their fans. It was clear that the future of the music business would require artists to maintain a direct line of communication with fans via the Internet. The brilliance, humor, knowledge and hubris that users brought enlivened the Okayplayer message boards. This energy helped The Roots build on the community that they had cultivated throughout the making of Things Fall Apart and beyond.\n\nToday, The Roots enjoy a rare status among hip-hop acts.

        "description": "“It was school for me. My professors were Shawn Gee, Angela Nissel, Questlove, Donwill.”\nThis is howRob Cave Jr., one of the first Okayplayers, as well as a graphic designer and rapper, summed up his time having an integral hand in the world of OKP throughout the late ‘90s and early ‘00s.\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, he’d ultimately make his way to Philadelphia after getting accepted to the now-defunct Art Institute of Philadelphia. But it’d be his time working at theOkayplayeroffices there — first as an intern with daily duties encompassing ordering sandwiches, helping build the OKP website, designing tour merch and many, many, many other responsibilities, before being brought on full-time — where he’d get a hands-on learning experience unlike any other.\nPhoto courtesy of Rob Cave.He’d even have a slightly awkward encounter with a then-up-and-coming Jill Scott, who he was unaware was already familiar with The Roots crew when he didn’t let her in the side door of a venue prior to a Black Lily event. (He didn’t want to upset late Roots manager Rich Nichols who, earlier that day, had claimed that the street team Cave was a part of was letting people in without paying, telling Cave’s boss, “Your [team is] letting in all these motherf**kers in here for free?”“Later on that night, The Roots are on stage like, ‘Make some noise for my girl from Philly, Jill Scott.’ And she tore the shit down. I'm standing there with my f**king face on the floor, like, ‘Oh my God, I slammed the door in this girl's face,’” Cave recalled.His time withOkayplayeralso led to longtime friendships courtesy of OKP’s message boards, where he’d meet Von Pea of Tanya Morgan and Che Grand. This also culminated in the creation of TheLessondary, a collective named after “The Lesson,” a subforum on the message boards, that includes Cave,Von Pea, Che Grand,Donwilland Elucid.As Cave shared, this experience came at a much-needed time. He met most of theOkayplayerteam back then shortly after his dad died (his mother had also passed a few years prior), and their support and guidance set him — a then-high school senior about to embark on college — straight.Fast-forward to now, and he’s done design work for the NBA, Def Jam, Christina Milian, and he recently released a new album,Kairos.In honor ofOkayplayerturning 26, Cave spoke with us about how he came to learn ofOkayplayer, his time with OKP and how it impacted his life, some of his fondest memories from working with OKP, and more — including how he indirectly coined another name forOkayplayer’swebsite that only real heads know: “That Site.”Photo courtesy of Rob Cave.Shared in as-told-to format, lightly edited for length and clarity, here’s Cave.Rob Cave:[Angela Nissel] was the webmaster; she would give me my task list for the week, pretty much. And it was a lot of that. I think the first featured artist [I built a website for] might have been Talib Kweli for theReflection Eternalalbum. That was the first thing I did completely on my own. Before that, Doug [Muir] did most of the sites, and I did most of the maintenance on the sites.When I did theReflection Eternalsite, Kweli came into the office to check it out, and when I showed him something, he did not know how to use a computer. He kind of poked the mouse like it was going to do something. He moved the mouse with one finger, and I was like, ‘No, you got to hold it, and move it around.’ It was funny.My favorite thing probably has to be the Dilated Peoples website we did. It was like a game. You had to find a token, and then get into a train station and find s**t. It was very, very interactive. It was in the heyday of [multimedia technology] Flash. It was the best Flash site I think I've ever seen.I feel really proud [of being a part ofOkayplayer’shistory]. Not only did they accept me and push me with graphic design, they accepted me and pushed me in music too. And when my interest in becoming a MC reared its head, Shawn Gee really started getting on me about the business of it. Let me give you an example. When I got down after a couple of months, I'm like, ‘Yo, I'm actually thinking I'mma start rapping.’ So, I'm thinking, all right, I’mma make a demo. Cool. I got to f**king Ahmir, I'm like, ‘Yo. Oh, you got beats? I think I'mma make a demo, I’m trying to get some beats going. You got some beats for me?’ And he'd be like, ‘Sure, sure, we about to go on the road, but when we get back, holler at me.’ I'm like, ‘All right, cool.’They get back, I'm like, ‘Yo, what's up Questlove, you got some beats for me, you got beats?’ He's like, ‘All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.’ [He] leaves, and then Shawn Gee calls me into his office. He's like, ‘Come here, man. You can't be asking Questlove for beats, what are you doing? What do you have? You don't have a thing.’ He's like, ‘What is it worth to him to give you a beat? Stop doing this, you're being annoying, that's not what you're here for. Do your job, stop asking for f**king beats.’I'm like, ‘Oh s**t, I'm in trouble now.’ I thought he was going to fire me.So, [The Roots] had a show in New York. I come to New York to help them and I'm still thinking I'm in trouble, so I'm extra on my P’s and Q’s, and I'm helping Questlove unload his drums, and he's like, ‘All right, so Malik B ain't coming to the show, so on this song you're going to rap instead of his verse.’ And this was the Hammerstein Ballroom, it's like 5,000 people. So, I'm like, ‘Word?’ If I made a mistake they wouldn't just write me off. They would show me the right thing to do and then give me a chance.Rob Cave with Questlove.Photo courtesy of Rob Cave.Do you know whyOkayplayeris referred to as ‘That Site?’ It's, like, indirectly my fault. After I leftOkayplayerand moved back to New York, me and my boy Ben [Detrick] started a record label/magazine calledLoosie.Loosiehad message boards as well, and pretty much all of our users were just New York Okayplayers and Philly Okayplayers. During that time, there were some technical difficulties — I think they were rebuilding the boards onOkayplayer— so they would crash every once in a while. And whenever they would crash, our boards would get flooded with usage. These were people fromOkayplayer, and they would just come on our boards and talk shit aboutOkayplayeruntil the boards were fixed. Then, they'd all leave. It was like a mass exodus every time.So, I got pissed off, and I'm like, ‘Don't come over here just to talk shit aboutOkayplayer.Just don't do that shit. It’s corny. If you want to come here, stay here, we got good discussions, we got different things to talk about, come and enjoy it. But don't just come here, talk shit about them, and then go right back when they get fixed.’At the time, the moderator of our board was Desus Nice, and [he] madeOkayplayera banned word on our website.

Do your job, stop asking for f**king beats.’\nI'm like, ‘Oh s**t, I'm in trouble now.’ I thought he was going to fire me.\n\nSo, [The Roots] had a show in New York. I come to New York to help them and I'm still thinking I'm in trouble, so I'm extra on my P’s and Q’s, and I'm helping Questlove unload his drums, and he's like, ‘All right, so Malik B ain't coming to the show, so on this song you're going to rap instead of his verse.’ And this was the Hammerstein Ballroom, it's like 5,000 people. So, I'm like, ‘Word?’ If I made a mistake they wouldn't just write me off. They would show me the right thing to do and then give me a chance.\nRob Cave with Questlove.\nPhoto courtesy of Rob Cave.\nDo you know whyOkayplayeris referred to as ‘That Site?’ It's, like, indirectly my fault. After I leftOkayplayerand moved back to New York, me and my boy Ben [Detrick] started a record label/magazine calledLoosie.Loosiehad message boards as well, and pretty much all of our users were just New York Okayplayers and Philly Okayplayers. During that time, there were some technical difficulties — I think they were rebuilding the boards onOkayplayer— so they would crash every once in a while. And whenever they would crash, our boards would get flooded with usage. These were people fromOkayplayer, and they would just come on our boards and talk shit aboutOkayplayeruntil the boards were fixed. Then, they'd all leave. It was like a mass exodus every time.\nSo, I got pissed off, and I'm like, ‘Don't come over here just to talk shit aboutOkayplayer.Just don't do that shit. It’s corny. If you want to come here, stay here, we got good discussions, we got different things to talk about, come and enjoy it. But don't just come here, talk shit about them, and then go right back when they get fixed.’\nAt the time, the moderator of our board was Desus Nice, and [he] madeOkayplayera banned word on our website. So, if you actually typed inOkayplayeron our boards, it would change it to ‘#thatsite.’",

        "description": "A newWu-Tang Clanalbum will be arriving soon.\nIn a report fromVariety,Mathematics, an affiliate of the beloved rap group and the man behind its internationally known logo, explained that he’s serving as lead producer on a forthcoming Wu-Tang project titledBlack Samson, The Bastard Swordsman: From The Wu-Tang, the Saga Continues Collection.\nAs the outlet shared, Mathematics is producing the album in its entirety, and also brought the Wu members together for the special project, which “is labeled as a joint effort with [Mathematics] and the acclaimed collective.”\nWhile speaking withVarietyaboutBlack Samson, Mathematics shared the inspiration behind the album’s name.“It’s an homage toBlaxploitationmovies. You have movies like Black Samson, Black Caesar and Super Fly. Those are the type of movies that I was raised on in the 1970s,” he said. “The Bastard Swordsman part of [the title] is an ode to the old karate flicks because that’s what I grew up on as well. With me as well as all of Wu-Tang, that’s something we had in common. We all loved the old karate flicks. Bastard Swordsman is one of my favorites.”He also talked about getting all of the Wu members involved for the album, noting that although it was a “long and tedious” process, “It’s my brothers, when I need them, I call them.”“All praises due, they show up. I’m grateful for that,” he added. “It definitely takes time. We’ve been doing residencies and tours, so to sit down and lock in is kind of hard. But we’re around each other so much, when we do get in the studio, it makes it easier and the vibe is better.”It should be noted that there has, in the past, been a distinction between Wu-Tang and the Wu-Tang Clan. Wu-Tang releases have generally either not featured every Wu-Tang Clan member and or have included different production from the Wu-Tang Clan releases. On Apple Music, 2017’sThe Saga Continues,Legendary Weapons (Deluxe Edition)(2011),andChamber Music(2009) are all listed as Wu-Tang releases rather than Wu-Tang Clan drops.

        "title": "Rediscovered: Dead Prez, ‘Let’s Get Free’",
        "description": "The paradox of change is that, often, those who call for it with impassioned urgency are rarely around for the long haul. At the very least, if they do stick around, they tend not to enjoy the privileges of widespread visibility for an extended period of time. And what’s most beautiful is that these agents of metamorphosis always appear in moments that are tailormade for their mission. At the turn of this millennium, when hip-hop was settling into an era of unabashed decadence, a pair of messengers from opposite ends of the Eastern Seaboard came together to pose a serious inquiry: where is any of this really getting us? And if that place isn’t somewhere closer to collective liberation in any form, how invested in it should we actually be? That is the burning question being asked throughout the duration of rap duoDead Prez’s2000 debut album,Let’s Get Free.\nMembersM-1andstic.manfirst meaningfully connected in the early ‘90s when the two were taking one of psychologist Dr. Dana Dennard’s courses at Florida A&M University — a man stic attributes his early understandings of race relations to. What brought them together was a shared discontentment; a feeling that things they witnessed and experienced in their communities as young men should not be accepted as commonplace. Already expressing themselves through rhymes individually, they formed as an act and relocated to Brooklyn after FAMU.\nBefore one even contends with the political ideas being levied onLet’s Get Free, a key component to their appeal was that M-1 hailed from New York City and stic.man from Wakulla County, Florida — Tallahassee being the closest city — giving their music a sort of dual consciousness. The uptempo bounce indicative of Southern rap working in tandem with the vocal tenacity of the East Coast gave their conscious rhyming the ability to stimulate the body just as much as the mind. A real chore for that brand of hip-hop in many cases. It’s why the album’s most well-known track “Hip Hop” worked seamlessly as the music that introducedDave ChappelleonChappelle’s Showin the early 2000s; while you could rage to the hook’s anthemic rhythm, underneath that is a pointed disapproval for how major labels conduct business and how artists’ vapid displays of wealth were becoming increasingly see-though. “I’m sick of that fake thug R&B rap scenario all day on the radio / Same scenes in the video. Monotonous material. Y’all don’t hear me, though,”stic declared in his verse.\nThematically, the insight offered throughoutLet’s Get Freefeels immediate for the time of its release as it does evergreen in hindsight. “I’m a African,” which is the most obvious in revealing the duo’s Florida rap DNA from a production standpoint, embraces a simple truth that should be evident, but through American conditioning, is too often lost in the psyche of Black folks whose family lines have been on these shores for generations. In the song, M-1 starts his verse with,“No, I wasn’t born in Ghana, but Africa is my momma,”and the rest of the song is a tribute to enslaved Africans of the past, freedom fighters like South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, and the Black socialist Uhuru movement. It’s a needed reminder that, no matter where on the world map Black people reside, there are forces working overtime to keep them in a repressed existence, and the first step in quelling those forces is trying to get on one accord.“Police State” takes a macro look at mass incarceration on the heels of 1994’s Crime Bill and Prez’s assertions couldn’t be put more plainly: adisproportionate amount of Black menrot in prison and, partly due to that, the Black community suffers from a social and economic standpoint. And even if a few negroes are enjoying high-paying corporate positions, how much of a win can it truly be if it has no real bearing on the community’s overall condition? At other points, like in “Psychology,” stic.man laments the nightmare of seeing his father smoke crack, which is already difficult at the most basic emotional level, but acutely infuriating when you’re conscious of how that predicament was largely engineered.I didn’t mindfully encounter Dead Prez’s music until I first entered my 20s at the top of the 2010s. It was a natural progression for me. My upbringing was an Afrocentric one; Orthodox Ethiopian crosses on the walls of my house, African artwork on display, a mixture of Black American and Caribbean presence in my family that helped establish, at the least, a surface-level understanding of diasporic plight across imaginary borders. But it wasn’t explicitly political. There were regular conversations around race relations.Baltimore, like many other places that have considerable Black populations in this country, was andstill is flagrantly segregated. The neighborhoods I occupied throughout my childhood and adolescence were worlds apart from the ones where white people resided. So being intrinsically aware of disparities was common. What wasn’t common were conversations around how thoroughly those disparities were engineered and, even better, how to actively combat them through education and organizing.In a household where artists likeBob Marley,Peter Tosh, andGil Scott-Heronwere in regular rotation, I knew what politically motivated Black music aimed to convey. But it wasn’t until I reached college age, ventured out of my hometown for the first time, and started to interface with non-Black people on a regular basis that the struggles of my own family members, my community, and my city, at large, became painfully apparent. It wasn’t until then that I realized everybody doesn’t have a family member wrapped up in the carceral system, or a family member deeply struggling with addiction, or a grandmother struggling to make ends meet. Anger set in and Dead Prez justified those feelings. With those life experiences already loaded into my psyche, I was destined to be deeply affected by stories inLet’s Get FreelikeFred Hampton Jr.potentially being framed, as ifhis father’s assassination wasn’t enough. Or how both members denounced Christianity at a time when I was recognizing the faith I was raised in was not working for me, or anyone else in my community, by my estimation.Now, 25 years later, I am even more impressed with not only the fact that Dead Prez accomplished getting a piece of work so radical released through mainstream music industry channels, but their instincts and assessments were largely prophetic. It is common knowledge in 2025 that police forces throughout America are heavily militarized and not interested in proactive community work — not that they ever were in non-white areas. I experienced that truth firsthand in 2015 when, in response to Baltimore’s uprising forthe police killing ofFreddie Gray, military officers were deployed into the city and, to even walk down a certain block, I had to ask permission from men in full combat gear to pass by in fear of my own life.“Be Healthy,” looking back may be a bit cheesy, but with the information we have now about our food industries in America, veganism is a mainstream way of life. “Hip Hop,” in 2000, acted in opposition to the direction the genre was headed with microwavable acts being preyed on by labels and now, in 2025, when artists are lucky to have 18-month-long runs, the general public is more privy to how predatory entertainment industries are.Dead Prez wouldn’t stick around in the mainstream for long. After their second album, 2004’sRBG: Revolutionary But Gangsta,was released (and scored aJay-Zfeature), the duo began releasing independent work and strayed away from the fickle fandom that comes with widespread visibility. But that didn’t happen before their initial messages created a lasting ripple effect that’s been spreading for a quarter of a century. This is the power of intentional and principled art. It identifies an issue, addresses it with an emphasis on finding the balance between entertainment and truth, and is uninterested if it makes the creator a fortune. What is most crucial is that you speak truth to power in a way that dismantles generational divides.Let’s Get Freeurges that being wrapped up in any other superficial outcome further places us in the quicksand we’re already sinking in.\n\nThematically, the insight offered throughoutLet’s Get Freefeels immediate for the time of its release as it does evergreen in hindsight. “I’m a African,” which is the most obvious in revealing the duo’s Florida rap DNA from a production standpoint, embraces a simple truth that should be evident, but through American conditioning, is too often lost in the psyche of Black folks whose family lines have been on these shores for generations.

        "description": "Feb. 7 2025, marks what would’ve been J Dilla’s 51st birthday. Nineteen years after his passing, the producer-rapper's impact can still be felt across the music world.\nDuring his time on this Earth, he influenced acts like A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, a hero who eventually became his peer. He’d also reorient the feel, pulse and rhythm of music as he made crucial contributions to hip-hop as part of the Soulquarians collective.\nQuestloveonce described Dillaas “the music god that music gods and music experts and music lovers worship.”To this day, old and new fans alike are still mesmerized by the beats he crafted, leaving a legacy of music that’s intricate, progressive and rich.In his honor — along with February 7 nowbeing recognized as “Dilla Day”in the producer’s home city, Detroit — we reached out to a handful of artists and music industry figures to speak about what Dilla meant to them.From fellow producers like Sango and Swarvy to rappers Nappy Nina and Cavalier, here’s what they had to share.Kaelin EllisI’m sure many people will share what Dilla means to them musically. But my understanding of Dilla came at a time when I was still finding my way — still figuring out what I truly wanted. Then, I stumbled across a Jay Dee instrumental on YouTube.Dilla wasn’t just someone who understood music — he embodied it. Understanding everything — the fire patterns, the rhythms, the taste — it all comes from what you like and blending it with what you enjoy. Dilla showed me that music is more than sound; it’s a bridge to everything. That realization shaped me in ways I didn’t expect.For that, I’m forever grateful for J Dilla’s influence and his legacy in hip-hop history.Simply, thank you, Jay Dee.SangoSee on InstagramDilla has had a big impact on my life, starting when I was about five years old. One of the first albums I remember hearing in the house wasBeats, Rhymes and Lifeby A Tribe Called Quest. It was always in my dad’s CD crate, and I spent a lot of time staring at the cover and listening to it. One song on that album, “Get a Hold,” became one of my favorites. By the time I was 15, I realized it was produced by Dilla, and that discovery changed everything for me.Dilla is my favorite producer of all time. As someone from Michigan, I feel a deep connection. His influence on my creative journey is everything. The way he would put out instrumental projects became the blueprint for my career as Sango. That’s how I wanted to set myself apart — not just as a producer, but as an artist like him.My favorite Dilla project isThe Shining. I remember listening to it as a high schooler in Michigan, shoveling driveways during the snowy winters. That album was the soundtrack to those moments, and it’s always stayed with me.If I had to describe Dilla in one word, it would be passion.SwarvySee on InstagramDilla is the first person I think of when I think of a true love for music. You can tell how deep his appreciation was for all kinds of musicianship and genres because his body of work displays that so well. It's as if you can feel him smiling through the speakers when you hear his music.I'm always inspired by people who are in love with their passion. Dilla is one of those artists that, because of how true and dedicated he was to his craft, there's an endless well of inspiration in the work he left behind for anyone willing to tap into it.My favorite Dilla production is probably \"Dynamite!\" by The Roots.Nappy NinaJ Dilla is a possibility model for artists trying to create their own sonic imprint. To this day, we call out music [that] sounds like Dilla but not quite (it can’t be copied), we reference the “Dilla Siren,” and nod extra deeply when his cuts come on in the spaces we visit. We talk about how no one will ever be able to do it the way he did. His legacy is everlasting through the folks he’s influenced. J Dilla continues to have a hand in how I make shit, which pockets I choose, the drums I lean toward. I don’t have a favorite Dilla project but I often wish I was a part of the magic that the Soulquarians made, and “Hold Tight” by Slum Village — produced by Dilla — is on my most played tracks list yearly.CavalierDilla’s influence on our wave is undeniable. Many that would call themselves “Dilla babies” have become the very producers and beat makers who are behind the production of some of the most memorable works from myself and many of your faves, and not just in rap either. I'm bad with favorites, but if I had to pull a Dilla song … [it] would be \"Fuck the Police.\"BilalIf I could describe Dilla with one word, it would be subtle. The subtle details that he put in his beats is what made them just so creative and different. The shadow kicks, the landscaping keyboards over [the] top [of] the groove. It was just certain things that he would add to the shadows that made the beat incredible.Count Bass DJ Dilla is on a list of instrumentalists I call the “Generational Js.” You got John Coltrane from the Greatest Generation; Jimi Hendrix from the Silent Generation; Jaco Pastorius as a boomer; and James Dewitt Yancey representing Generation X. He influenced my style because his music is soul music. Detroit has the best gospel scene and you don't get soul without gospel. Matter of fact, when I first heard his music for the first time, I said, “This guy got to play organ,” because I could hear the left foot in his baseline.Vintageis my favorite project of his, and specifically “Earl,” because I can — and I have — listened to that track for days straight. So in one word, J Dilla is a juggernaut, and it ain't going to be another one. So God bless his soul.Illa JSee on InstagramMy brother, James Dewitt Yancey, aka J Dilla aka Dilla Dog Dilla. What he means to me is just an amazing big brother and also an amazing human being. Someone who not only cared about his family, really cared about his friends, and even a stranger on the street — the type of person who would take his shirt off his back and give it to someone. And obviously, musically amazing — just a genius, and really inspired me to want to be the best at my craft in whatever I pursue. And not only that, to not be afraid to do it my own way.He affected my path, obviously, the biggest way, because just him not being here, missing all those conversations, being the only two people in our family really having an actual music career outside of my dad. So I would've loved to have all those conversations with my bro. So it affected me in that way, but I had to learn how to do it on my own, and I know his spirit was always there guiding me. When it comes to music, I have so many songs of his that I love, so it's hard for me to pick a favorite song. It'll be different every time. But I will say I just love the swing of his music, the swing and the feel. One word to describe my brother: pure. That's it, Dilla.JWordsOne thing I learned about Dilla was that he created his own style and that he paved his own way. He made it possible for me to be able to do the same thing.One of my favorite projects from Dilla is what he did with Slum Village.One word I would use to describe Dilla is, “unique.”Suzi AnalogueJay Dee, J Dilla — the most prolific beatmaker of modern times. As a beatmaker myself [and] a producer, songwriter, how this person's imagination and just sheer innovation of machines to technology like vinyl — of which he has many amazing records of his own — has changed the world and shifted how we even listen and hear hip-hop. I teach Dilla in my classes as a music professor at UNC in my beatmaking lab. We study his techniques. His techniques are studied around the world, and he was a sound scientist. He wasn't just a musician; he was a sound scientist. And especially with sampling, with chopping, he innovated, and he inspired us to live in our own worlds and bring that out sonically and really convey more than just the sound of music, but communicate with music as a language. And so I really thank Jay Dee for that, and I thank him for the inspiration that he's left and how he put us on to Detroit.DJ 47Chops (HiTech)J Dilla has definitely influenced my life and creativity in a way that makes me — when it comes on the creative side, to incorporate human spontaneity and embrace the fact that it's not perfect, and also to taking that over to my life and embracing that as well. Embracing the imperfections.Goya GumbaniJ Dilla is my GOAT. J Dilla is the GOAT. He has just made me want to make music in the most obscure way, and that's the most truest and honest to myself. There's a level of just growing as a human and as an artist, and they both coexist and never fitting inside of a box because music is not meant to be that, art is not meant to be that. And he's the definition of not allowing that to happen. That's why he's my GOAT. That's why he's the GOAT. The influence he had is crazy because I collect a lot of records and I just end up finding these crazy b-cuts or these crazy b-side tracks that Dilla did the remix to, or I can hear the influence that he's had on someone just so random, and I'm just like, “Yo, I know where that technique is from. That technique feels familiar.”Then you just come to find out that they've also been influenced by just his humanization of laying drum patterns or cutting samples up and putting them back together in a way that's like, they shouldn't make sense, but sonically it feels right and it sounds right. The influence is deep.My favorite J Dilla track is this track called “Purple.” He did a remix for this band called Crustation from Bristol in the United Kingdom. It’s a trip-hop band that made one album; I think the album's calledBloomor something. Anyway, he did the remix for “Purple,” and “Purple” is one of [those] songs that I put it on — if I'm in a room and someone's like, “Yo, play a song,” and it's a really relaxed vibe, I'm like, “All right, I got the perfect song that everyone in this room is gonna entwine in this sonic moment.I would definitely recommend that song to anyone that hasn't heard it, and if you have heard it, play it again. Play it for the whole month. Play it for the whole month just because, you know what I mean? RIP to the GOAT. Happy Dilla Month to the GOAT, and thank you for inspiring many of us from the 2000s to this very moment. There's people in 2025 — I'm still hearing that pull and push snare technique, and I'm like, “We're still going strong.” So thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you.

        "title": "15 Essential Dilla Remixes",
        "description": "J Dillareinvented the remix. Since remixing’s inception with Jamaican dub reggae pioneers in the 1960s and razor blade-wielding tape-editing disco producers like Tom Moulton in the 1970s, it has been a vital part of many producers' toolkits and a way to get their names in circulation. Like the forebearers that influenced him — Pete Rock, Marley Marl and Kurtis Mantronik — Detroit-born producer J Dilla was as gifted at remixing and reimagining existing songs as he was at crafting his own original productions. During his early years in the music business, Dilla worked underQ-Tip’smentorship, producing and remixing tracks as part of the Ummah production collective. During this early run of productions, Dilla laced many established artists with his characteristically soulful and funky beats. Today, nearly two decades after his tragic and untimely passing, these remixes for hire have gone on to become some of Dilla’s music beloved and influential productions. Here are a handful of essential remixes created by one of hip-hop’s most beloved musical minds.\nSpacek - “Eve (JayDee Mix)” feat. Frank N’ DankJ Dilla’s remix of British future soul act Spacek's single “Eve” is a delightfully meta game of musical telephone. With its muted, bubbly bassline, and deliberately swung drum pattern, Spacek’s original was clearly influenced by Dilla’s earlier production work for A Tribe Called Quest and Slum Village. For the remix, Dilla one-ups Spacek’s original, even opening the track by stating“Let me fuck wit it,”before completely blowing the track up and giving it a dramatic facelift. Anchored by a cavernous kick and snare and menacing synth bassline, the breezy, soulful tune is transformed into a dark and seductive masterpiece. With guest verses from Frank N Dank extolling the joys of getting money and rockingiceychains, Dilla’s “Eve” sounds like it was made for a spotlight dance for a strip club in outer space.D’Angelo - “Me And Those Dreamin' Eyes Of Mine”Many of J Dilla’s productions between 1995 and ‘97 bore a distinct sonic signature. Beats like Busta Rhymes’ “Still Shining”, Slum Village’s “Estimate” and “Pregnant” are all based around the simple arrangement of an electric piano sample, a heavily syncopated bassline, and cracking, swinging drums. Perhaps the mightiest beat in this particular Dilla chamber is the beat he made for an unreleased remix of D’Angelo’s “Me and Those Dreaming Eyes Of Mine”. The beat — also known as “Dreamy” — is built on a hypnotic four-bar keyboard sample that perfectly compliments D’Angelo’s rich vocal harmonies and tender falsetto. A gorgeous marriage of hip-hop and R&B sensibilities, Dilla’s take on the D’Angelo classic injects “neo-soul” with some serious weight, texture and grit.Four Tet - “As Serious As Your Life (Jay Dee Remix)\" feat. Guilty SimpsonAt first glance, J Dilla and London-born DJ, producer and multi-instrumentalist Kieran Hebden (also known as Four Tet) appear to have little in common. While Dilla grew up in Detroit, immersed in hip-hop culture, Hebden came up in London playing in the instrumental, post-rock outfit, Fridge. Despite these superficial differences, both men’s relentless drive to experiment within their chosen genres made them kindred spirits in a way. Naturally, the2003 meeting between Dilla and Four Tetunleashed all kinds of intriguing musical possibilities. By pitching up the original’s main riff and adding fresh verses from himself and Detroit-native Guilty Simpson, Dilla transforms Four Tet’s abstract instrumental into a raw and bizarre underground rap classic.The Brand New Heavies - “Sometimes (Jay Dee Remix)” feat. Q-TipA shining gem of Dilla’s Ummah/Delicious Vinyl era, “Sometimes” was the 4th single from U.K. modern Funk pioneersThe Brand New Heavies’ 1997 album,Shelter. With its impossibly swung interplay between the keys, drums and bass, the Ummah remix of “Sometimes” is funky and head nod-inducing as anything that’s ever been committed to tape. Add in some delicious vocal chemistry between Q-Tip and N’Dea Davenport and you get a bright and optimistic jam that still works on the dancefloor.Vivian Green - “Fanatic”Musically and emotionally, the original version of Philly singer-songwriter Vivian Green’s “Fanatic” is vastly different from J Dilla’s remix. The original’s hazy, laidback instrumental arrangement is a stark contrast to Green’s lyrics about an addictive love. For the remix, Dilla strips the entire song down and pairs Green’s vocal with a crooked, jittery beat that brings some appropriate tension to the song. The result is a speaker-punishing, yet nervy take on Green’s ode to all-consuming love.Crustation - “Purple (A Tribe Called Quest Mix)”“Purple” is the 1997 singlefrom Bristol electronic band, Crustation. Originally dubbed the “A Tribe Called Quest Mix,” Dilla’s remix of “Purple” sounds like it was beamed in from another planet. Vocalist Bronagh Slevin’s performance pairs beautifully with Dilla’s slow, syrupy beat. Songs like “Purple” suggest that Dilla could’ve made a killing hooking up with electronic singers and crafting dreamy, MTV Amp-ready mood music.Busta Rhymes - “Woo-Hah!! Got You All In Check (The Jay Dee Other Shit Remix)”Although the two never produced a full-length project together in Dilla’s lifetime, J Dilla and Busta Rhymes had an unparalleled musical chemistry. Songs like “Still Shining,” “Show Me What You Got” and “Takin What’s Mine” stand as high points in both men’s extensive catalog. While Rashad “Tumblin’ Dice” Smith’s original is a certified classic, “The Jay Dee Other Shit Remix” is quintessential mid-’90s Dilla with its muted bass, chopped-up, ascending keyboard chords and neck-snapping drums. The beat is silky smooth and bouncy, providing a great contrast to Busta’s gruff, animated vocal.The Pharcyde - “She Said (Jay Dee remix)”For many hip-hop fans, The Pharcyde’s1995 sophomore album,Labcabincaliforniawas their introduction to J Dilla’s production. Not only did he produce the album’s hit lead single “Runnin’” (and its B-side “Drop”), he also lent his magic to several standout album cuts and a scorching remix of the album’s second single “She Said.” With its filtered piano chords and bass that sound like they were pulled from a well-worn jazz record, the “She Said” remix embodies the wavy, textured sound that Dilla explored during his time working with The Pharcyde.Keith Murray - “The Rhyme (Slum Village remix)”Aggressively bouncy and impossibly catchy, the “Slum Village Remix” of Keith Murray’s “The Rhyme” is a prime example of Dilla’s preternatural gift as a remixer. Erick Sermon’s original paired Murray’s vocal with butter-soft keys and a slick, halftime interpolation of the bassline from Frankie Beverly and Maze’s cookout classic “Before I Let Go.” In Dilla’s hands, the song is completely revamped with swinging, stuttering drums and a colossal bass. Against this new sonic backdrop, Murray’s energetic battle raps and scattershot energy feel perfectly at home.De la Soul - “Stakes is High (Jay Dee remix)”An underappreciated conundrum that comes with the art of remixing is figuring out how to put a unique spin on a well-known and beloved song. With its grand orchestral loop and an infectious vocal sample yanked from James Brown’s “Mind Power,” De la Soul’s “Stakes Is High” is one of Dilla’s signature beats. Instead of trying to top the outsized energy of the original, Dilla’s remix is a relaxed, understated bop. Guided by his bouncy, slapping drum beat, Dilla chops up some gorgeous Fender Rhodes chords to create a remix that strikes a lovely balance between rugged and smooth.Mood - “Secrets of The Sand (remix)”When Cincinnati rap outfit Mood released their albumDOOMin 1997, the song “Secrets of The Sand” made serious waves in underground rap circles. Earning spins on radio mix shows nationwide, Jahson’s original production sports a dark and dream-like, Latin-tinged feel. Dilla’s remix brightens the mood (no pun intended) with a perky drum groove and a guitar sample filtered to mimic the sound of a wah-wah pedal. Once you get to the tune’s soaring, sung chorus, you get a remix that is distinct and cooked to perfection.Common - “Come Close (Closer)\" feat. Q-Tip, Erykah Badu and Pharrell WilliamsNot only did Q-Tip help Dilla get early production placements through his work with The Ummah, the crisp, jazzy sound that Tip pioneered with A Tribe Called Quest influenced the way Dilla made music. This influence is evident in the way that Dilla would pay homage to Tip’s sound by flipping samples that his mentor had previously touched. For the “Closer” remix to Common’s 2002 single “Come Close to Me”, Dilla puts his own spin on the keyboard sample from RAMP’s “Daylight” that Tip used for ATCQ’s “Bonita Applebum.. With Dilla’s lush beat and guest vocals from Tip, Erykah Badu and Pharrell, the “Come Close” remix is a fly love song for the ages.Brother Jack McDuff - “Oblighetto (Jay Dae remix)”For the2004 compilation Blue Note Revisited,contemporary producers like Jazzanova, Osunlade and Madlib are recruited to rework classic cuts from the legendary jazz label’s storied vaults. In a particularly inspired choice, J Dilla was tapped to remixBrother Jack McDuff’s 1970 single “Oblighetto”The original is a sublime soul-jazz cut full of McDuff’s rich organ and ghostly, wordless vocals and Dilla’s remix takes it to another realm, entirely. Refitting the tune with a drum groove similar to his2001 cover of Donald Byrd’s “Think Twice,”Dilla transforms “Oblighetto” into a fresh hip-hop/jazz hybrid.Das Efx - \"Microphone Master\"This remix of Das Efx’s1995 single “Microphone Master”finds Dilla operating at the peak of his remixing powers. In contrast to Easy Mo Bee’s raw, grainy original, Dilla’s take is bright and full of glowing electric piano chords. Typical of Dilla’s mid-’90s productions, the beat is fueled by a bouncy, swinging drum pattern that provides a perfect foundation for Skoob and Drayz’s nimble, virtuosic rhymes.Innerzone Orchestra - “People Make The World Go Round (J88 Remix)”Innerzone Orchestra is a side project from Detroit Techno pioneer, Carl Craig. On their1999 debut,Programmed, Craig and crew combined jazz fusion, hip-hop, and soul into an intoxicating and future-minded whole. The band recruited Dilla to produce a remix for their grand, orchestral take on Linda Creed, Thom Bell and The Stylistic’s 1971 epic,“People Make The World Go Round.”Ever the tasteful producer with great feel, Dilla allows Paul Randolph’s voice and guitar as well as Cris Benjey’s dramatic string arrangement to breathe for a full two minutes and forty seconds before dropping the beat. Once Dilla’s groovy drums and bass join in 5/4 time, the entire track is lifted to another level.\n\nJ Dilla’s remix of British future soul act Spacek's single “Eve” is a delightfully meta game of musical telephone. With its muted, bubbly bassline, and deliberately swung drum pattern, Spacek’s original was clearly influenced by Dilla’s earlier production work for A Tribe Called Quest and Slum Village. For the remix, Dilla one-ups Spacek’s original, even opening the track by stating“Let me fuck wit it,”before completely blowing the track up and giving it a dramatic facelift. Anchored by a cavernous kick and snare and menacing synth bassline, the breezy, soulful tune is transformed into a dark and seductive masterpiece. With guest verses from Frank N Dank extolling the joys of getting money and rockingiceychains, Dilla’s “Eve” sounds like it was made for a spotlight dance for a strip club in outer space.\n\nMany of J Dilla’s productions between 1995 and ‘97 bore a distinct sonic signature. Beats like Busta Rhymes’ “Still Shining”, Slum Village’s “Estimate” and “Pregnant” are all based around the simple arrangement of an electric piano sample, a heavily syncopated bassline, and cracking, swinging drums. Perhaps the mightiest beat in this particular Dilla chamber is the beat he made for an unreleased remix of D’Angelo’s “Me and Those Dreaming Eyes Of Mine”. The beat — also known as “Dreamy” — is built on a hypnotic four-bar keyboard sample that perfectly compliments D’Angelo’s rich vocal harmonies and tender falsetto. A gorgeous marriage of hip-hop and R&B sensibilities, Dilla’s take on the D’Angelo classic injects “neo-soul” with some serious weight, texture and grit.\n\nAt first glance, J Dilla and London-born DJ, producer and multi-instrumentalist Kieran Hebden (also known as Four Tet) appear to have little in common. While Dilla grew up in Detroit, immersed in hip-hop culture, Hebden came up in London playing in the instrumental, post-rock outfit, Fridge. Despite these superficial differences, both men’s relentless drive to experiment within their chosen genres made them kindred spirits in a way. Naturally, the2003 meeting between Dilla and Four Tetunleashed all kinds of intriguing musical possibilities. By pitching up the original’s main riff and adding fresh verses from himself and Detroit-native Guilty Simpson, Dilla transforms Four Tet’s abstract instrumental into a raw and bizarre underground rap classic.\n\nA shining gem of Dilla’s Ummah/Delicious Vinyl era, “Sometimes” was the 4th single from U.K. modern Funk pioneersThe Brand New Heavies’ 1997 album,Shelter. With its impossibly swung interplay between the keys, drums and bass, the Ummah remix of “Sometimes” is funky and head nod-inducing as anything that’s ever been committed to tape. Add in some delicious vocal chemistry between Q-Tip and N’Dea Davenport and you get a bright and optimistic jam that still works on the dancefloor.\n\nMusically and emotionally, the original version of Philly singer-songwriter Vivian Green’s “Fanatic” is vastly different from J Dilla’s remix. The original’s hazy, laidback instrumental arrangement is a stark contrast to Green’s lyrics about an addictive love. For the remix, Dilla strips the entire song down and pairs Green’s vocal with a crooked, jittery beat that brings some appropriate tension to the song. The result is a speaker-punishing, yet nervy take on Green’s ode to all-consuming love.\n\n“Purple” is the 1997 singlefrom Bristol electronic band, Crustation. Originally dubbed the “A Tribe Called Quest Mix,” Dilla’s remix of “Purple” sounds like it was beamed in from another planet. Vocalist Bronagh Slevin’s performance pairs beautifully with Dilla’s slow, syrupy beat. Songs like “Purple” suggest that Dilla could’ve made a killing hooking up with electronic singers and crafting dreamy, MTV Amp-ready mood music.\n\nAlthough the two never produced a full-length project together in Dilla’s lifetime, J Dilla and Busta Rhymes had an unparalleled musical chemistry. Songs like “Still Shining,” “Show Me What You Got” and “Takin What’s Mine” stand as high points in both men’s extensive catalog.

It’s been a very rich time, but I must say I picked up the drums again a few weeks ago, and I feel like music is meant to capture the spirit. It freezes it in time like no other art form.”",

        "description": "As the first month of 2025 comes to a close, a slew of new music has been released, especially in regard to singles.\nThis week offered a stacked collection of loosies, including “Bad Choices,” a track byLarry June, 2 Chainz and The Alchemist; “Plaqueboymax” by Fivio Foreign; and a particularly interesting collab between Sexyy Red and Bruno Mars called “Fat Juicy & Wet.”\nAs for albums, we’ve got a new project fromBoldy James,Central Cee and Charlie Bereal.\nNEW SONGSLARRY JUNE, 2 CHAINZ AND THE ALCHEMIST, “BAD CHOICES”Over a smooth-as-always production from The Alchemist, Larry June and 2 Chainz offer cool raps (also, can we get some more collabs between Chainz and Alc?).REASON FEAT.

        "description": "After serving as the leader of theSun Ra Arkestrafor 30 years, alto saxophonistMarshall Allenis finally releasing his own solo album.\nThe 100-year-old musician has announcedNew Dawn, his solo debut that will be released on February 14 via Mexican Summer/Week-End Records. The jazz musician shared a new single from the album,its title track(which featuresNeneh Cherry), earlier this week. Previously, he shared the single“African Sunset”last year.\nAccording to AL.com,New Dawnfeatures seven tracks: “Prologue,” “African Sunset,” “New Dawn,” “Are You Ready,” “Sonny’s Dance,” “Boma” and “Angels and Demons at Play.”Allen, who has led the Sun Ra Arkestra (named after the brilliant, Afrofuturist jazz musician Sun Ra) since 1995,spoke with Jazzwise last yearabout how he discovered — and ultimately joined — the Arkestra, sharing how it all began with coming across the group’sSuper-Sonic Jazzalbum released in 1957.“I had a job at a camera company, polishing lenses. One day, I got off work and bought that album. I took it home and listened to it and I was like, ‘Boy, what’s that band?’ The stuff they were doing, I’d never heard that before. It was far out and [had] different kinds of melodies,” he recalled. “So, I went back and asked the guy I bought the record off, ‘Where’s this band? This is a real band!’ He said, ‘Well, they’re right up there near you, about six blocks from where you live. They practice every night up there.’ So, I went and found ’em. I heard the band, and they sounded so good, I ran back and brought my horn!”“‘Course, I was late for work the next day,” Allen continued. “I’d stayed up all night with Sun Ra because, after he got through rehearsing, we went over to hear a saxophone player in a club and then we went out to eat and, the next thing you know, it was four or five in the morning, and I went to work all late and sleepy and everything. That was when I met him. And he asked me to come to rehearsals.”“I tried to get into the band and then I was lucky because some of the mainstay guys were moving to New York.

        "title": "The 15 Best Rap Songs From NBA Players",
        "description": "On his 2010 song “Thank me Now”Drake raps the now famous line: “Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous, 'Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us.”\nWhen it comes to professional sports — specifically the NBA — and hip-hop, there are many times when the two industries overlap each other. In recent years, NBA players have continuously been seen hanging around high-profile hip-hop artists. Furthermore, NBA superstars such asDamian Lillardhave attempted to make waves in the rap industry in recent years, dropping multiple songs.\nThe latest NBA player — or former one — to drop bars is none-other-than LiAngelo Ball, who pulled up with a Louisiana-inspired new banger to start of 2025. Titled \"Tweaker,\" the track has quickly taken over. But will it take over our list? Check it out for yourself to see.\n15. Tobe Nwigwe —  \"Lil Fish, Big Pond\" (2023)This is far from the first time that an NBA player has attempted to rap on wax. Over the years, many pro basketball players have produced songs, with some even releasing entire albums. From hall-of-famers like LeBron James and Allen Iverson to bench players like Lance Stephenson and Lou Williams, here are the best rap songs created by NBA players.14. Chris Webber & Kurupt —  \"Gangsta! Gangsta! (How U Do It)\"  (1999)Two West Coast hall-of-farmers connect on \"Gangsta! Gangsta! (How U Do It).\" The song is the most successful single from Webber’s debut album2 Much Drama. The song, which was produced by Lord Maji, features a sample of the ‘80s electronic song “Laid Back” by White Horse. There is some impressive lyrics from Webber here, but Kurupt, who is as charismatic and energetic as ever, carries the track (random fact about Webber: later on he would produce somesongs for Nas).13. Lance Stephenson — “Hot N****” (2014)Born and raised in Brooklyn, it was fitting for Lance to remix a song thatembodied New York City culture.Most of the lyrics are basketball related, which on the surface might seem corny. However, the diversity the NBA vet keeps throughout his lyrics makes it not seem overbearing.For a professional basketball player, Lance’s flows seem natural, embracing a touch only a Brooklyn native would know about.12.  Lou Williams — “Ima Boss” (Freestyle) (2013)Lou Williams spent his first seven NBA seasons playing for the Philadelphia 76ers, and it seems that he took some of that Philly swagger with him.His“ Ima Boss” flip is unexpectedly impressive. Unlike Lance, Williams keeps his mentions of basketball to a minimum, which really enhances the lyrics and the creativity behind them. The only thing holding this track back is that it comes in at just over 90 seconds, leaving more to be desired.11. Gary Payton — “Livin' Legal and Large” (1994)In 1994, Epic Records released a compilation album calledB-Ball’s Best Kept Secret. The album featured 1990s basketball stars rapping with ‘90s hip-hop stars (we used to be a country).One of the songs is “Livin’ Legal and Large,” which features hall-of-famer Gary Payton rapping over a track that just radiates chill vibes. The Oakland native does his bestToo Shortimpersonation, trading in thevulgar content, making a mostly G-rated track.10. LeBron James & Kevin Durant —  “It Ain’t Easy” (2011)Rivals on the court, friends off. LeBron James and Kevin Durant, two generational superstars, teamed up during the 2011 NBA lockout season to produce “It Ain’t Easy.” Unlike most of the other songs on this list, both James and Durant get deep with their lyrics. The pair both rap about their individual struggles throughout their childhood, and what their path to the NBA was like. “No chance to make it out, that's what they said: “Well, look at me, I'm here, boss of the spread,” James raps.Although they both provide solid lyrics throughout the track, there is something about it that feels off. It’s just odd to hear these well recognized voices rapping.9. Aaron Gordon — “9 Out of 10”  (2020)NBA champion Aaron Gordon is widely regarded as thegreatest NBA dunk contest participantto have never actually won. This track is referring to when many believed he was “robbed” during the 2020 dunk contest, when judge and future hall-of-famer Dwyane Wade gave him a nine out of 10 — one point shy of a perfect score.Gordon raps about everyone who has doubted him, with subtle disses to Wade throughout. Despite most of the lyrics sticking to basketball, Gordon makes them unique, rapping slick lines like: “Big chillin’ paint me as a villain… I jumped over the biggest dude in the building.”8. Lonzo Ball & DC the Don — “Free Smoke” (2017)When this was released, Lonzo Ball was one of the most polarizing players in the NBA, mainly because of his father, LaVar, who would continuously make headlines and steal the spotlight from his sons. Outside of basketball, Lonzo attempted to gain media attention in ways such as appearing on reality TV shows andmaking fun of Nas.Remixing the 2017 song from Drake, Lonzo gives us some impressive flows throughout the track. The lyrics are simple, catchy, and not overdone. There’s some rap cliches here — “Diamond chain it match the Rollie / Whip the whip like it's stolen,” sounds like something you would here from a generic rapper — but the track mostly works.7. Jason Kidd & Money-B — “What the Kidd Did” (1994)Out of the 15 tracks included on this list, “What the Kidd Did” is definitely the most underrated.The song was releasedbefore the future hall-of-fame point guard was taken in the 1994 NBA draft. “What the Kidd Did” features Oakland legend Money B — who ghost wrote the song.“What the Kidd Did” is just delightful, featuring an awesomeG-Funkbeat similar to Snoop Dogg’s “Ain't No Fun.” As for the lyrics, Kidd keeps it clean, rapping mostly about hooping.6. Dame D.O.L.L.A. & Lil Wayne — “Sorry” (2019)Widely regarded as the best current NBA rapper, five time all-star Damian Lillard has a solid discography of music. Compared to the others on this list, Lillard, known as Dame D.O.L.L.A musically, sounds the most natural on the mic.For this track in particular, not only does he showcase impressive flows, legendary rapper Lil Wayne hops on at the end as a feature. The hard-hitting instrumental pairs nicely with the two rapper’s lyrics.5. Dana Barros, Cedric Ceballos, A.G., Sadat X & Grand Puba — “Ya Don’t Stop”  (1994)“Ya Don’t Stop,” from point guard Dana Barros and small forward Cedric Ceballos, is as ‘90s as it gets. The song, which was produced byDiamond D, is the standout fromB-Ball's Best Kept Secret. And the professional rappers, A.G., Sadat X and Grand Puba, do the heavy-lifting, kicking NBA-inspired punchlines over the perfect mid ‘90s hip-hop beat.4. Kobe Bryant, Broady Boy & 50 Cent — “Thug Poet” (2000)One of the more surprising facets of Kobe Bryant’s legendary careerwas that he was signedto Columbia Records for a short period of time, and produced an unreleased album in the early 2000s. That album, calledVisions,leaked in its entirety. And it’s understood that “Thug Poet,” which features 50 Cent and Broady Boy, a member of Kobe's CHEIZAW crew, is easily the standout.The song hits hard with knocking Trackmasters beat,a pre nine shots 50, and playful Kobe rapping lines like, “My microphones and Glock nines, Black? I'm dipped in that.”3. Allen Iverson — \"40 Barz\"“40 Barz” is easily the mostcontroversial songon this list. To say that the lyrics are intense is an understatement. Unlike the rest of the tracks released by NBA players that appear fun and relaxed, Allen Iverson embraces a East coast-inspired gangsta rap image.After “40 Bars” — which was supposed to be on AI’s rap debut — leaked in 2000, the song became front page news. Former NBA commissionerDavid Stern publicly spoke outagainst the song for its violent content (there are multiple lines referring to killing people, as well as homophobic and sexist lines throughout). Iverson told Stern he would change the offensive lyrics on the song and album.

And, despite some of the questionable language and content, the track isn’t bad, with AI showcasing some ability on the mic.2. G3 (LiAngelo Ball) — \"Tweaker\" (2025)Did LiAngelo Ball just drop the rap song of 2025?The question might sound like hyperbole, or perhaps even blatant cap, but consider this: the audio video for the track — which was appropriately released through WorldStarHipHop — has accumulated over 8 million YouTube views in 10 days. The track collected over 15 million Spotify streams in the same amount of time. While Okayplayer can confirm that the track earned Gelo a Def Jam record deal, it's unclear if it's for anything near the massive $13 million that's been reported. But the point remains, it was impactful enough to get him a deal. Big Baller indeed.So, yeah. The song is big.But that's just speaking on its impact; it actually goes too. For it, LiAngelo coasts over a vintage Cash Money-esque beat as, affecting a Southern drawl that sounds absolutely nothing like the Chino Hills community that raised him. But he coils those vocals into a chorus that would make Juvenile proud, swirling his baritone into a swaying chant that insists on being repeated. Between the beat, the hook, and some undeniable mic presence, it's the type of track that'll make you want to hit the block and bend some corners, too.1. Shaquille O’Neal & The Notorious B.I.G. — \"You Can't Stop the Reign” (1996)Being able to even team up with arguably the greatest rapper of all time is a feat within itself, let alone somehow holding your own with him. Shaquille O’Neal is no stranger to music; he has released four albums that have appeared in theBillboardtop 100. His debut album,Shaq Diesel,released in 1993, isa certified platinum record. With all of this into consideration, Shaq is easily the most accomplished artist on this list.The track itself is nothing short of remarkable. Biggie is great, obviously, but Shaq holds his own. Shaq’s lyrics are easily the most impressive from any player on the list. This paired with the jazzy instrumental makes the track a truly amazing listen.\nThis is far from the first time that an NBA player has attempted to rap on wax. Over the years, many pro basketball players have produced songs, with some even releasing entire albums. From hall-of-famers like LeBron James and Allen Iverson to bench players like Lance Stephenson and Lou Williams, here are the best rap songs created by NBA players.\nTwo West Coast hall-of-farmers connect on \"Gangsta! Gangsta! (How U Do It).\" The song is the most successful single from Webber’s debut album2 Much Drama. The song, which was produced by Lord Maji, features a sample of the ‘80s electronic song “Laid Back” by White Horse. There is some impressive lyrics from Webber here, but Kurupt, who is as charismatic and energetic as ever, carries the track (random fact about Webber: later on he would produce somesongs for Nas).\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, it was fitting for Lance to remix a song thatembodied New York City culture.Most of the lyrics are basketball related, which on the surface might seem corny. However, the diversity the NBA vet keeps throughout his lyrics makes it not seem overbearing.\nFor a professional basketball player, Lance’s flows seem natural, embracing a touch only a Brooklyn native would know about.\nLou Williams spent his first seven NBA seasons playing for the Philadelphia 76ers, and it seems that he took some of that Philly swagger with him.\nHis“ Ima Boss” flip is unexpectedly impressive. Unlike Lance, Williams keeps his mentions of basketball to a minimum, which really enhances the lyrics and the creativity behind them. The only thing holding this track back is that it comes in at just over 90 seconds, leaving more to be desired.\nIn 1994, Epic Records released a compilation album calledB-Ball’s Best Kept Secret. The album featured 1990s basketball stars rapping with ‘90s hip-hop stars (we used to be a country).\nOne of the songs is “Livin’ Legal and Large,” which features hall-of-famer Gary Payton rapping over a track that just radiates chill vibes. The Oakland native does his bestToo Shortimpersonation, trading in thevulgar content, making a mostly G-rated track.\nRivals on the court, friends off. LeBron James and Kevin Durant, two generational superstars, teamed up during the 2011 NBA lockout season to produce “It Ain’t Easy.” Unlike most of the other songs on this list, both James and Durant get deep with their lyrics. The pair both rap about their individual struggles throughout their childhood, and what their path to the NBA was like. “No chance to make it out, that's what they said: “Well, look at me, I'm here, boss of the spread,” James raps.\nAlthough they both provide solid lyrics throughout the track, there is something about it that feels off. It’s just odd to hear these well recognized voices rapping.\nNBA champion Aaron Gordon is widely regarded as thegreatest NBA dunk contest participantto have never actually won. This track is referring to when many believed he was “robbed” during the 2020 dunk contest, when judge and future hall-of-famer Dwyane Wade gave him a nine out of 10 — one point shy of a perfect score.\nGordon raps about everyone who has doubted him, with subtle disses to Wade throughout. Despite most of the lyrics sticking to basketball, Gordon makes them unique, rapping slick lines like: “Big chillin’ paint me as a villain… I jumped over the biggest dude in the building.”\nWhen this was released, Lonzo Ball was one of the most polarizing players in the NBA, mainly because of his father, LaVar, who would continuously make headlines and steal the spotlight from his sons. Outside of basketball, Lonzo attempted to gain media attention in ways such as appearing on reality TV shows andmaking fun of Nas.\nRemixing the 2017 song from Drake, Lonzo gives us some impressive flows throughout the track. The lyrics are simple, catchy, and not overdone. There’s some rap cliches here — “Diamond chain it match the Rollie / Whip the whip like it's stolen,” sounds like something you would here from a generic rapper — but the track mostly works.\nOut of the 15 tracks included on this list, “What the Kidd Did” is definitely the most underrated.The song was releasedbefore the future hall-of-fame point guard was taken in the 1994 NBA draft. “What the Kidd Did” features Oakland legend Money B — who ghost wrote the song.\nWidely regarded as the best current NBA rapper, five time all-star Damian Lillard has a solid discography of music. Compared to the others on this list, Lillard, known as Dame D.O.L.L.A musically, sounds the most natural on the mic.\nFor this track in particular, not only does he showcase impressive flows, legendary rapper Lil Wayne hops on at the end as a feature. The hard-hitting instrumental pairs nicely with the two rapper’s lyrics.\n“Ya Don’t Stop,” from point guard Dana Barros and small forward Cedric Ceballos, is as ‘90s as it gets. The song, which was produced byDiamond D, is the standout fromB-Ball's Best Kept Secret. And the professional rappers, A.G., Sadat X and Grand Puba, do the heavy-lifting, kicking NBA-inspired punchlines over the perfect mid ‘90s hip-hop beat.\nOne of the more surprising facets of Kobe Bryant’s legendary careerwas that he was signedto Columbia Records for a short period of time, and produced an unreleased album in the early 2000s. That album, calledVisions,leaked in its entirety. And it’s understood that “Thug Poet,” which features 50 Cent and Broady Boy, a member of Kobe's CHEIZAW crew, is easily the standout.\nThe song hits hard with knocking Trackmasters beat,a pre nine shots 50, and playful Kobe rapping lines like, “My microphones and Glock nines, Black? I'm dipped in that.”\n“40 Barz” is easily the mostcontroversial songon this list. To say that the lyrics are intense is an understatement. Unlike the rest of the tracks released by NBA players that appear fun and relaxed, Allen Iverson embraces a East coast-inspired gangsta rap image.\nAfter “40 Bars” — which was supposed to be on AI’s rap debut — leaked in 2000, the song became front page news. Former NBA commissionerDavid Stern publicly spoke outagainst the song for its violent content (there are multiple lines referring to killing people, as well as homophobic and sexist lines throughout). Iverson told Stern he would change the offensive lyrics on the song and album. But the album, which was supposed to be called Non Fiction, was never released.\nYears later, Iverson has detailed some regrets about the whole ordeal, referring to it as “thatterrible rap album”in a past interview.\nNevertheless, the impact that this song has in regards to the culture throughout the NBA can not go unnoticed. And, despite some of the questionable language and content, the track isn’t bad, with AI showcasing some ability on the mic.\nDid LiAngelo Ball just drop the rap song of 2025?\nThe question might sound like hyperbole, or perhaps even blatant cap, but consider this: the audio video for the track — which was appropriately released through WorldStarHipHop — has accumulated over 8 million YouTube views in 10 days. The track collected over 15 million Spotify streams in the same amount of time. While Okayplayer can confirm that the track earned Gelo a Def Jam record deal, it's unclear if it's for anything near the massive $13 million that's been reported.

        "title": "In Her Words: Keri Hilson is Choosing Peace Over Perfection",
        "description": "Long before she became a household name as a solo artist,Keri Hilsonwas penning chart-toppers for some of the biggest names in the music industry, includingMary J. Blige,Usher, and Britney Spears, solidifying her status as one of the most gifted songwriters behind the scenes. When her own breakout moment came via smash singles like “Knock You Down,” “Pretty Girl Rock,” and “Turnin Me On,” Hilson proved she wasn’t just writing the hits — she possessed all the skills and gifts to be the main character. After taking a step back from music, Hilson turned her attention to acting, bringing depth and relatability to roles in films likeThink Like a Man,Almost Christmas,Don’t Waste Your Pretty, andFor the Love of Money. Though her journey hasn’t been without setbacks or public scrutiny, Hilson has remained rooted in her creativity.\nNow, after years away from the mic, Hilson is staging a return with a new album,We Need To Talk: Love— not to prove anything to anyone else, but to honor the artist within. In thisIn Her Wordsconversation for Mental Wellness Month,Okayplayercaught up with Hilson to discuss the tools she uses to stay grounded while navigating the unpredictable rhythms of a creative life, in an as-told-to below lightly edited for length and clarity.\nOn Creating Rituals for WellnessKeri Hilson:I journal. I am in therapy. I have my therapist basically on call when I need an appointment. I used to have a standing [appointment] before things got really busy lately — I called it Therapy Thursdays. That’s just been really hard to keep because things are moving very fast again. My life is just a little more unpredictable. I still journal. I paint. Cooking and painting are things that I do — and walking and exposing myself to nature — those are also things I do very regularly that just help me maintain my sanity.They help me sort my thoughts... do internal bookkeeping. When I’m mulling over something or ruminating on an idea... these are things that help me surface an issue or figure out a solution to a challenge.I’ve also gone on spiritual retreats. Vacations every now and then when I need to — I’m taking one in June. There are certain things that I do for my mental well-being, and I just implement them.On Comfort Through Cooking, Gardening and Nature WalksThe other night I landed and just felt so beside myself. We’ve been going, going, going. Most days when I am home, I’m cooking at least lunch — something small and quick. I eat very clean, so it’s quick stuff to make. I just felt like I needed to create something. I can’t remember what I made that night — but around midnight, I decided that wasn’t enough. It wasn’t that I was hungry, because I didn’t eat any, but I made a pie.Cooking ismy way of grounding. Gardening — literally grounding. That is one of the most grounding practices. I grow vegetables. Tomatoes, cucumbers. It’s really all about creating regimens that are in place for my sanity and grounding.The walking in nature is grounding. The gardening outside — actually barefoot sometimes — that’s a literal grounding practice. The others are more just creative grounding. I play with my plants. I do have house plants, like 30 house plants. I think it’s about creating space and time for yourself.When I feel [down], I know it's usually because I haven't expressed these activities in recent time… Last week that happened. I realized like, ‘Oh, I haven’t taken a walk this week.’ I brought my clothes and we walked in Rhode Island. Just beautiful, hilly, serene. A wild turkey crossed the road. It was kind of gloomy and rainy, like a cross between San Francisco and New Zealand. It was a beautiful walk.On Spiritual Retreats and the Power of ClarityOne time, I went on a spiritual retreat in San Diego. I was going because I just felt so much inner turmoil at the time. This was maybe 10 years ago, around 2014 or 2015. I left that retreat and had broken up with the person I was seeing then because I left with so much clarity. I came with turmoil, and I left with clarity.There was another retreat I did in Sedona. That was more of a spiritual group. We did prayers,meditation,hiking on the trail in the mountains. You kind of find your little spot and just connect. I left there with clarity too. I don’t want to give up some of the spiritual parts, but I know something had become very clear to me — something I needed to do in business. I don’t recall exactly, but I remember feeling like, ‘Ah, okay. I see this clearly now.’On Learning to Manage Breakups and Difficult TimesYou know what's best for you. Even if it's hard, keep pushing on. We know deep inside when something just is not right and not aligned with our desires. Get the help that you need if you need to sort through your thoughts and figure things out. There's nothing wrong with that. There should be no stigma or shame attached to wanting to make wise decisions and wanting to lean towards health and healing. We all can feel conflicted. We all can feel confused. We all have overstayed our welcome in places and with people that don't serve us, or we've outgrown, or whatever the scenario is for you, but I would say, get the help that you need.I've never gone through it alone. I've got abeautiful tribe of peoplewho helped me through life's rough moments, which no one is exempt from. And tapping into your resources, be it people, methods, all of it, that's like a cheat code. You don't have to go it alone. You don't have to, and you should not. There are people that have gone through it. There are people that can help you through it. There are books about it. There are so many methods now.For me, one person would be my stylist,Jilene Coggins. She just has a way of changing and shifting your perspective. Like a therapist, or a spiritual guru. I call her The Love Guru. She helps you love yourself and accept yourself and the things you’re trying to sort out.I have two therapist friends who are in Family and Children counseling. They’re really helpful too. I also have my spiritual advisors and people that I can call when I really am needing some guidance, besides my therapist.On Music, Acting and Staying PresentActing — it can be an escape. I was trying to think of a better word for it, but yes, it can be an escape. And I guess that can go good or bad depending on what’s going on. But while I was grieving my father, it was a welcomed escape from grief. That’s when I really threw myself further into acting, when I was grieving the loss of my father. So I think that's been a welcome and healthy outlet for me.Music as well. When I am creating and devoting myself to it... time stops. It brings your focus into the now. They say the root of anxiety is looking too far into the future, and the root of depression is ruminating over the past. Whenever you have something in front of you that you are devoted to, and focused on, it brings your focus into the now.”There’s a book by Eckhart Tolle calledThe Power of Now.It’s a really difficult read. To be honest, I had to read it twice. A lot of big words and new concepts at the time. But now, I think I’d breeze through it. That book helped shift my perspective.I think creating allows you to just pause time and focus, and not in a negative way, but focus on here and now, and that really gives your nervous system a break. It puts your mind and spirit at ease 100%. Music and acting, everything I do that I love, painting, cooking, whatever. Everyone has their thing that they're passionate about, or their group of things, like I do.On Being Recognized in Public and Choosing to Be a VesselThat’s kind of easy, because I don’t ever want to actually be in a store of any kind. I shop for everything online. You won’t catch me in the mall. It used to be once a year at Christmas time — now I don’t even do that. I hate shopping of all kinds.But yes, there are some things that you want normalcy with—like church. I’ve been approached by people and taken pictures at church. There are times when I may be going out to meet a friend, and we’re talking about something really serious. It could be an official therapy session. And someone may want a picture, and I’ve got to step outside of that moment.But I don’t look at any of those things as hindrances. I look at them as blessings. There’s a switch that I have — it’s like I can be a vessel in this moment. There’s something I could say that may be imparted upon them for the rest of their life. There’s a way that I could inspire them.\nKeri Hilson:I journal. I am in therapy. I have my therapist basically on call when I need an appointment.

They’re really helpful too. I also have my spiritual advisors and people that I can call when I really am needing some guidance, besides my therapist.\nActing — it can be an escape. I was trying to think of a better word for it, but yes, it can be an escape. And I guess that can go good or bad depending on what’s going on. But while I was grieving my father, it was a welcomed escape from grief. That’s when I really threw myself further into acting, when I was grieving the loss of my father. So I think that's been a welcome and healthy outlet for me.\nMusic as well. When I am creating and devoting myself to it... time stops. It brings your focus into the now. They say the root of anxiety is looking too far into the future, and the root of depression is ruminating over the past. Whenever you have something in front of you that you are devoted to, and focused on, it brings your focus into the now.”\nThere’s a book by Eckhart Tolle calledThe Power of Now.It’s a really difficult read. To be honest, I had to read it twice. A lot of big words and new concepts at the time. But now, I think I’d breeze through it. That book helped shift my perspective.\nI think creating allows you to just pause time and focus, and not in a negative way, but focus on here and now, and that really gives your nervous system a break. It puts your mind and spirit at ease 100%. Music and acting, everything I do that I love, painting, cooking, whatever. Everyone has their thing that they're passionate about, or their group of things, like I do.\nThat’s kind of easy, because I don’t ever want to actually be in a store of any kind. I shop for everything online. You won’t catch me in the mall. It used to be once a year at Christmas time — now I don’t even do that. I hate shopping of all kinds.\nBut yes, there are some things that you want normalcy with—like church. I’ve been approached by people and taken pictures at church. There are times when I may be going out to meet a friend, and we’re talking about something really serious. It could be an official therapy session. And someone may want a picture, and I’ve got to step outside of that moment.\nBut I don’t look at any of those things as hindrances. I look at them as blessings. There’s a switch that I have — it’s like I can be a vessel in this moment. There’s something I could say that may be imparted upon them for the rest of their life. There’s a way that I could inspire them.",

        "title": "A Case for a Sober Summer",
        "description": "Last year, when I turned 40, something shifted in how I think about my health. Suddenly, everything I did — what I ate, how much I slept, what I put on and in my body — felt like it mattered more. It was like I could feel time in my bones. I started paying closer attention to longevity, and with that came a new question I hadn’t asked myself seriously before: Why am I still drinking?\nIt wasn’t dramatic, just a slow disinterest. The more I tuned in to how alcohol made me feel (anxious, sluggish, less clear), the less I wanted it. And it turns out I’m not alone.\nSobriety is trending, but not in a gimmicky way. It’s a cultural shift. Gen Zdrinks less than any generationbefore them, and nearly half of American adults said they plan to drink less in 2025. If you’ve been thinking about a hard reset, this might be the perfect summer to do it.\nHere’s why.\nYou’ll Look and Feel More AliveAlcohol messes with your glow. It dehydrates your skin, breaks down collagen, andinflames your face. This translates to more puffiness, fine lines, and breakouts. Even if you're sipping tequila neat or sticking to wine, alcohol can throw off your skin's balance, and it shows.Skipping drinks or swapping for a mocktail gives your body space to bounce back. You’ll notice clearer skin, brighter eyes, and a more rested look, especially if you’re also getting better sleep (more on that in a second). In short, if you’d like to age like organic fruit, keep throwing back the shots. If you would rather retain your youth as long as possible, consider cutting back.Your Mental Health Will Thank YouIt’s easy to romanticize summer drinking. A little rosé in the park, rooftop happy hours, BYOB house parties. But the after-effects are far less cute. Alcohol canworsen anxiety, amplify depressive moods, and disrupt how your brain regulates emotions. That short-term buzz often leads to long-term blues that might be harder to shake off as you get older.Taking a break can clear mental fog and help you check in with yourself more honestly. Whether you deal with anxiety or just want more peace of mind, a sober summer is a strong start.Better Sleep, More EnergyAccording to the Sleep Foundation, even one drink canmess with your sleep cycle, especially REM sleep, the deep kind that really restores your body. You might fall asleep faster, but you’ll wake up groggy, dehydrated, and more tired the next day.Without alcohol, your sleep becomes deeper and more consistent. That translates to better mood, more energy, and sharper focus. All those summer mornings you used to sleep through? Now you’re up early, catching light on a walk, writing, plotting your next move.You’re Not Alone in ThisLet’s be real: summer is when we need our energy the most. The days are longer, the streets are active, and the skin is out. This is the season to feel sharp, look good, and move with purpose. If there’s ever a time to tap into your healthiest self, it’s right now.So if you’re considering a sober summer, you’re not doing it in a vacuum. We’re enteringa cultural momentwhere choosing to be clear-minded isn’t just accepted, it’s celebrated. From nonalcoholic drink brands blowing up to artistsopenly sharing their sobriety journeys, the conversation around alcohol is shifting.\nAlcohol messes with your glow.

        "description": "Ryan Coogleris explaining how hip-hop is the lifeblood of his hit vampire flickSinners.In an interview withRolling Stone, the Oakland native shared how the film is informed by hip-hop even through its presentation of the blues.\n“Blues is the entry point to the movie for me, but if blues was the entry point, hip-hop was the car that I was driving in,” Coogler says in the interview. “For every music that I come across in my life experience, hip-hop is what I know as being mine. It’s my native language. And so for me to really feel like I could make this movie, I had to truly understand that blues was hip-hop’s ancestor.”\nSinnersis a monster hit.According toBox Office Mojo,Sinnershas reached a major box office milestone: surpassing $350 million worldwide.The movie starsMichael B. Jordanin a dual role as twin brothers Smoke and Stack, who move back to Mississippi from Chicago to open a jook joint. It also features Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, Jack O'Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Omar Miller and Delroy Lindo.Later in theRolling Stoneinterview, Coogler talks about the power in Black music — and how that power can be exploited. But ultimately, he sees Black music as a liberator.“I got a family who was very intergenerational since slavery was abolished,” he says. “They fled the Jim Crow South. We make it our business to stick around each other. I could not justify [making] a movie with vampires biting into people’s necks without showing this part of me; showing these people – that drew the straw of being born and dying in the height of sharecropping, miscegenation laws, and these back-breaking, dehumanizing, racist policies – with their descendants having a good time. Music is magical. That was the A side to the B side of everything else. Hip-hop has its place in that.”Sinnersmakes its streaming debut today (June 3).\nSinnersis a monster hit.According toBox Office Mojo,Sinnershas reached a major box office milestone: surpassing $350 million worldwide.The movie starsMichael B.

        "title": "A Tribute to the Lasting Legacy of Dikembe Mutombo",
        "description": "For millennial kids with middle school growth spurts, or ones who were just tall and played center, Dikembe Mutombo was a central figure. If you blocked a shot from the year 1997 through 2009, it was almost impulsive to want to do his iconic finger wag with the accompanying “no, no, no.” Since the big man’s tragic passing in September of 2024, I’ve been pondering what it was that made that move so lasting. It’s right up there with shooting a piece of trash and yelling “Kobe” or catching a pass over someone’s head and shouting “You got Mossed.” It was more than a simple braggadocio-filled taunt, Mutmbo with his signature move evoked two powerful things simultaneously — passionate defense and playful childlike joy.\nThese two traits were not just what defined his dominating presence on the basketball court, but also what seemed to drive his even more substantial legacy. Mutombo, through his vast array of philanthropic efforts, first, defended the less fortunate from the difficulties of the world. In 1997, aptly the same year he did the finger wave on the court for the first time, Mutumbo created theDikembe Mutombo Foundation(DMF). His main aim for his first and most prominent philanthropic venture was to improve the quality of life in his home country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He invested heavily through the foundation in primary health care for low-income Congolese people. The cornerstone of the DMF was the Biamba Marie Mutombo hospital, named after his late mother which was eventually opened in late 2007. Mutumbo set out to defend his people from illness and by 2022 the hospital had treated over half a million patients.\nIf there was any other focus that Mutombo approached with the same amount of fervor as he did with his healthcare work, it was his work with school and education. Mutombo was the NBA’s first Global ambassador, and not only established and funded schools in rural impoverished areas of The Congo but also basketball programs. Many future Congolese NBA players were able to prosper due to Mutombo’s efforts, including Serge Ibaka and Bismack Biyombo.“You paved the way for myself and for many Congolese and African youth with your legendary basketball career and charitable actions. You are an African icon that will inspire the many coming generations,” Ibaka once wrote.Mutombo also provided countless scholarships to both African and U.S. students throughout his post-NBA career. But what truly defined his work was his interactive approach. Last October,USA Todayspoke with Mutombo’s former coach Williams ad Riley, who coached him for four years at Georgetown and went back to The Congo with him countless times to visit the children at the schools he supported.“His laugh sounded like the Cookie Monster,” Williams said toUSA Todayabout Mutumbo’s presence on the campuses. “He could speak several different languages, and sometimes you thought he was speaking a foreign language when he was speaking English, which would make you laugh. He always brought joy to any situation.”Global Humanitarian Award Honoree Dikembe Mutombo speaks at the Fourth Annual UNICEF Gala at The Foundry At Puritan Mill on April 12, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia.Photo by Marcus Ingram/Getty Images for UNICEF.In both of his two main focuses of humanitarianism, one thing can be said for sure, Mutombo always made people smile. One of his lesser publicized passions was working with an organization literally calledSmile Train. They partner with local healthcare workers and hospitals to provide treatment for children with cleft lips and palates. Mutombo not only worked with the organization in his Congolese hospital but also often supported them both financially and physically by showing up to entertain their patients. On their website, you can see countless pictures of Mutombo carrying small children through the hallways of hospitals and holding up his huge hands to their small ones. The CEO of the organization, after Mutombo’s passing, said, “While Dikembe may no longer be with us, the smiles and second chances he made possible through his partnership with Smile Train will bring hope, health, inspiration, and life to children throughout the DRC for generations to come.”Another element of Mutombo’s work that isn’t spoken about enough is his empowerment-centered company Mutombo Coffee. As a passionate defender, one of the core principles of excelling in that role is to provide support for your more offense-minded teammates. The coffee business primarily serves beans from African farms run by women. They even make sure to only source products from places that practice sustainable and fair trade practices, according to thecompany website. Coffee was a historically important crop in The Congo, but production plummeted as violence and civil unrest destroyed the industry before Mutumbo attempted to revive it. With his venture, which began in the middle of the 2020 pandemic, no less, Mutombo offered his countrywomen the support they needed to bring an essential industry back to life.Mutombo also provided my favorite player growing up, Allen Iverson, significant support and defense on the court when he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2001. That year was the sole year Iverson made a trip to the NBA finals. In anInstagram postsoon after Mutombo passed away, Iverson posted a picture of his former teammate hugging him with the caption, “See you when I get there Big Bro.” From his iconic finger wag, to his countless efforts in philanthropy, to his business ventures riddled with empowerment, Dikembe Mutombo always seemed to provide the energy of a supportive big brother. This is the enduring path he left behind for others to follow into a better world.Former NBA basketball player Dikembe Mutombo and Cuban children cheer during a clinical organized by the NBA, FIBA Americas and Cuban Basketball Federation on April 24, 2015, in Havana.Photo by YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images.\nIf there was any other focus that Mutombo approached with the same amount of fervor as he did with his healthcare work, it was his work with school and education.

        "description": "Movement is always a good idea. And thanks to the rise of the \"hot girl walk,\" walking has once again entered the fitness chat. While running may burn more calories, walking wins for one reason: it’s easy. No special equipment, no fancy membership, just your feet and a sidewalk.\nFor Chrissy, who unpacks diet culture in her book,The Body Liberation Project,often critiquesthe fitness industry’s obsession with discipline over joy. Instead, she sayssustainable movementshould be the main priority. “The movement practice you’re going to do consistently, and that doesn’t feel like you’re dreading it all day, that’s what matters.”So, where did this arbitrary number even come from? “This idea that I have to hit these 10,000 steps a day is not found in science,” Chrissy says. “It was literally just about marketing.” A study led by Dr. I-Min Lee, a Harvard Medical School professor and epidemiologist, traced the 10,000-step benchmark back to a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign. Her research, published inJAMA Internal Medicine, explored whether more steps actually led to lower mortality. The answer? Yes, but only to a point.The study found that women who averaged 4,400 steps per day had a 41% lower mortality rate than those who walked less. The benefits continued to increase with more steps but plateaued around 7,500.Still, the pressure to chase high step counts can backfire. “If you were a person who hasn’t been very active and you suddenly walk every single day, your body's gonna be hurting,” she says. And more often than not, Chrissy adds, the motivation isn’t health, it’s weight loss. That mindset, she says, is exactly where things go wrong. Even if weight loss is the goal, sustaining it should be part of the plan.Instead of setting massive daily goals, Chrissy encourages people to build movement into their lives in ways that feel manageable. “You can just take a 10-minute walk during your lunch break. It doesn’t have to be this huge commitment.” When weather or time make that tough, she suggests trying a walking pad. “I got one when it was really cold and snowy. I just turn on a show and walk on it while I watch TV.”And if a long walk doesn’t fit your day, break it up. Chrissy recommends splitting your movement into a few short walks, or making it social — call a friend, listen to a podcast, or use the time to catch up on an audiobook. You can also switch up your route, explore a new park, or just take a different block in your neighborhood to keep things fresh. However you get it in, the important part is that you move your body every day, whether you count your steps or not.\nFor Chrissy, who unpacks diet culture in her book,The Body Liberation Project,often critiquesthe fitness industry’s obsession with discipline over joy.

        "title": "5 Methods That Artists Use to Maintain Their Mental Health",
        "description": "There was once a time when speaking on one's mental health, in particular the instability of it, was seen as taboo.Mental health conversationsin regards to the rich and famous were prickly, almost downright nonexistent. But now, every budding musician on the precipice of stardom is ready and willing to speak on their mental health and wellness to connect with their audience both outside andwithin the realm of their music.\nIn part, musicians like Janet Jackson and Kendrick Lamar speaking out about mental health destigmatize things like ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, and more. Musicians have become more open to speaking about how they cope with their struggles, as not long ago musicians would be demonized for speaking about their mental health, as it wasn’t taken seriously. Even emerging stars like Doja Cat andDoechiihave been open about the burnout that accompanies fame and keeping up with the demands of fans. It’s not all glamorous parties and foreign cars; being thrust into the spotlight when you’ve never experienced it before can be jarring.\nFor Mental Health Awareness Month, we explore the myriad of tools that artists use to assist in their healing. While for us, we may lean on their music as a source of healing and strength, some artists have the resources to either enter rehab, meet with specialists, engage with therapy, or take extended time off from their irregular job. But even simple things like meditation, journaling, and staying away from social media are just some of the steps that the rich and famous (and you) can look to to care for your mental health.\nTherapyStock photo from Getty Images.Therapy is one of the more common tools that one can abide by for their mental health healing. There are a variety of different types of therapy you might need based on your ailment. While some therapy could look like the archetypical brain lady sitting in a chair taking notes, other forms of therapy might include medication or psychotherapy.Rapper Kid Cudi has been open about his struggles with depression, sparking a discussion about mental health within the hip-hop community. Back in 2016 the artist checked himselfinto a rehab facility, and since then he has been open about seeking therapy and the importance of getting help. For many fans of Cudi, his openness about his struggles encouraged others to get help as well.MeditationStock photo from Getty Images.Wellness may seem like a buzzword to us, and even the conception of meditation might seem silly. But many musicians meditate or journal their thoughts to deal with the anxieties of the world. While the application of this tool and its success may vary from person to person, it can be just one of many ways to deal with the horrors of the world. Meditation through yoga or journaling could be a helpful tool to add to your arsenal when you’re struggling with your mental health.Artists likeMoses Sumneyhave created music for meditation through the app Calm. Mediation music can be designed for listeners to sleep, relax, study, or meditate. With apps like Calm on the rise, more and more people are leaning towards meditation music or sounds to ease their anxieties.ExerciseStock photo from Getty Images.Exercise can be a great way to manage your mental health.Exercise has been proven to decrease depression and anxiety. While most artists have the privilege of hiring a trainer to be with them in the gym at all hours of the day, for the rest of us, starting with just a simple walk can be the first step.Exercise isn’t a cure-all, but making an effort to be active, in whatever ways work for you, can lead to feeling healthier, which is better for your mental and physical well-being.Delete Social MediaStock photo from Getty Images.What was once an innocent method of connecting with people has easily become a curse. Celebrity culture has evolved drastically over time since the emergence of gossip tabloids likeTMZandPerez Hilton, and social media has now closed the gap that artists once had with their fans. Now stans or haters can comment directly on their posts and artists can respond right back.For rappers likeMegan Thee Stallion, who was discovered online, it’s been imperative that she take the time to stay away from social media. At the height of her fame, her mother passed in 2019; then in 2020 after she wasshot in the foot by Tory Lanez, who then waged a social media campaign against her, the rapper further struggled with her mental health. Megan has been open about taking breaks from social media and logging off for extended periods of time and launched a mental health resources website,Bad Bitches Have Bad Days Tooin 2022.While most of us might not have millions of followers, taking time away from social media and focusing on the real world can do wonders for your mental health.MusicStock photo from Getty Images.It may seem counterintuitive for an artist to run towards the source of their strife as a method of healing, but for many of these artists, the act of creating art supersedes and even aids in their mental health.Music for us can be a source of healing, an opportunity to relate to others who may be going through the same issues. Artists can create from that space because they are not only speaking from their own experiences but using their music to connect to others. Kendrick Lamar releasedMr. Morale and the Big Steppersafter a five-year hiatus, which details his mental health struggles and how fame takes a toll on his interactions within his community and family. He also speaks extensively on his therapy journey, as seen in the music video for the song “Count Me Out.”Stock photo from Getty Images.Mental health isn’t attributed to any one of a certain class or status. Anyone can experience depression, anxiety, or OCD. Even the tools that one engages with don't have to break the bank. Similar to the artists mentioned above, we’re all going through something, but we need to be willing to get the help that we need to heal.\nStock photo from Getty Images.\nTherapy is one of the more common tools that one can abide by for their mental health healing.

        "title": "In Her Words: How Kat Graham Keeps it Even-Keeled",
        "description": "Kat Graham has never been just one thing. As an actor, she’s brought depth to beloved roles in projects likeThe Vampire Diaries,The Parent Trap,Duplicity,andOperation Christmas Drop.\nAs a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, she’s traveled the world — Jordan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Mexico, Brazil — amplifying the stories of displaced people and advocating for refugee rights.\nAs a musician, she’s produced and recorded multiple projects and is currently a Recording Academy trustee.\nAnd as a Black woman navigatingHollywood, the music industry, and humanitarian spaces, she has fought to stay grounded, connected and whole.\nIn thisIn Her Wordsinstallment for Mental Wellness Month, Kat opens up about what keeps her balanced, how she channels rage into purpose, and why mental health and spiritual grounding are essential to both surviving and thriving.\nOn Staying Grounded and Protecting Her Mental HealthKat Graham:Routineis something I think is really important. When you’re in school or have an intense job or you’re traveling, routine is the first thing that goes out the window — but it’s really the thing that helps you keep your health: mind, body, soul.Even if it’s just a five-minute meditation, I always meditate before I leave the house and set an intention for my day. I journal at night as a recap. Journaling helps me.And I drink water.It’s amazing what a thermos of water by your side can do. If you’re tired or feeling spread thin — just drink some water, and you feel automatically better.You don’t know what you’re walking into every day. I might think I’m going to have the easiest day at work, and then they pull up a scene that I have to be in a completely different state of mind for. People walk into work and get bad news from home or vice versa—you have to adjust. You have to adapt to life.I think the one thing that’s missing in the mental health conversation is the idea that you should stay ready so you don’t have to get ready. People don’t take care of themselves until something goes wrong or until they have a breakdown. But you gotta do the work even if you think your life is going perfectly, so that when you do get blindsided — and we all do — you’re prepared.On Using Real-Life Pain in Her Acting WorkThe technique that I use with all of my acting is called the Chubbuck technique. You use real moments in your life — real people as substitutions. It’s like an onion: layer upon layer of moments. Without the technique, I think I would have spiraled. A lot of actors can spiral.I’m very open about the abuse that I had when I was a child, and also how active I am in human rights. From George Floyd to refugees to systemic racism — these are things I’ve spent a good chunk of my life trying to raise awareness about. Obviously, I’m not doing that because those things make me feel happy. I’m doing it because I get angry enough that I need to do something about it. I have to make sure that that anger is controlled in the work that I do.On Standing in Her TruthIf you’re being bullied, or if you’re being singled out based on your age, your race, your religion, your sexual preference — don’t just push it away or accept it as “just how the world is.”Trust that there are people in this world who have your back. The hardest thing to do is to stand in your power.It’s easy to turtle in — to put your head in the sand and cover up who you naturally are to avoid negativity. But when you do that, you betray yourself. That’s when some of the most traumatic, most dangerous outcomes can happen. You’re betraying yourself by not saying, ‘This is not right for me.’There’s external stuff that affects your mental health, and then there’s stuff that’s internal. I’m not a mental health expert — my husband is — but I always say: talk to a professional if you feel like you’re dealing with something you can’t get above. Before turning to alcohol, drugs, or going back to a bad relationship — get support. There’sBetterHelp,YouTube, articles, books, even if you don’t have the finances. There’s support out there for you. You just have to be honest with yourself first, and then ask for it.On Losing Her Mother and Keeping Her Spirit CloseLosing my mom — it’s hard. It’s a more complicated grief because of the circumstances around it. She had been sick for a while. I still wish I could pick up the phone and call her. But I honor her by continuing to do human rights work, by continuing to be a grounded person, by working my ass off and not taking any shit. I continue on the legacy that she started for me. And I’m a spiritual person. I believe we are spirits having a human experience for a brief time. Then we’re coming back to where we came from. So I don’t treat this reality as the end-all, be-all. She’s still around — she’s just in a different dimension. I have access to that when I choose to.On Black Excellence and Surviving Childhood StardomI’ve been the same since I was about nine years old: extremely focused, not interested in what the other kids were doing. It was my choice to do homeschool. I didn’t want to go to a regular high school. I just wanted to train and be a great artist. I was that bossy Virgo kid keeping everyone in line.People talk about how child actors struggle, but I was like, ‘There’s no room for that.’ I’m not saying Black kids in entertainment don’t struggle — but if you compare it, it’s less common with minority kids. We can’t fall apart. There’s a different kind of pressure. You have to work ten times harder just to get in the room. You’re not gonna blow it when you finally get the opportunity.There’s so much rejection we go through just to even get the shot. That creates a different level of expectation — not just from family or culture, but from ourselves. That starts young.On Fighting for Her Mental Health Every DaySome losses you don’t ever heal from. Whether it’s a breakup or death — it’s not about ‘getting over it.’ It’s about how you’re healing yourself every day.Meditation, prayer, friends, food — what are you putting in your body? What are you putting on your body? How are you treating people? How do you stand up for yourself? It all adds up.People ask me about mental health a lot and I’m like, ‘Why are you asking me? I’ve gone through so much shit.’ But maybe it’s because I fight for it. And I think if people take one thing from our interview: you’ve gotta fight. For your health. For your relationships. For your joy.You’ve gotta put up a real fight for your happiness.On Celebrating Wins Without Losing BalanceI love food. I’ll do a cute dinner. But I don’t over-celebrate anything or give myself a hard time. I’m pretty even-keeled. I love celebrating my friends, though — if someone’s having a kid, got a promotion, got honored — I’m on it. But with myself, I have to stay grounded.I have an audience of people online who always have something to say—positive or negative. I can’t be affected by it. So I don’t let myself get too excited or too sad. I do my job, I go home, and the quality of my life remains. I try my best. I do the best with what I got. That’s gotta be good enough for me. It’s not always good enough — but it’s gotta be.\nKat Graham:Routineis something I think is really important.

        "title": "The Weeknd’s ‘Hurry Up Tomorrow’ Earns $3.3 Million at the Box Office",
        "description": "The Weeknd’snew Lionsgate-released movieHurry Up Tomorrowisn’t a hit at the box office.Varietyreportsthat the Trey Edward Shults-directed film opened with $3.3 million from 2,020 theaters – on a budget of $15 million.Hurry Up Tomorrowis the film companion to The Weeknd’s album of the same name.\nAccording to Comscore, May releases in 2025 are better than last year in terms of ticket sales but haven’t gone back to pre-pandemic numbers. Domestic revenues are 15% ahead of 2024 though still more than 32% behind 2019.Hurry Up Tomorrowstars The Weeknd as a fictionalized version of himself, teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown as he goes on a journey of self-discovery with a fan, played by Jenna Ortega. The story was inspired by a real-life incident where The Weeknd suddenly lost his voice during a show in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium in 2022. The Grammy-winner has been open about his mental health struggles.“My anxiety is a constant battle, and I feel like it never goes away,” hesaid last year.“I’m learning to control it, but I’ve already realized that it’s part of my life. I can’t escape it.”The movie, (which also stars Barry Keoghan), and album have been heavily publicized as artist Abel Tesfayeshedding “The Weeknd” as a persona. He says the film gave him a chance to relinquish control to his director.“I knew going into this film, you know, especially with someone like Trey, obviously I would never want to let someone like him down,” The Weeknd explainedin an interview withThe Fader. “I wanted to do my job as an actor. So, you know, make my peace with the idea, with the script, give whatever notes I have to give. But essentially it being his film, where I give him the material, he makes the movie he wants to make, and I get to just focus on being an actor and not give a fuck about what's going on behind the scenes.”\nAccording to Comscore, May releases in 2025 are better than last year in terms of ticket sales but haven’t gone back to pre-pandemic numbers. Domestic revenues are 15% ahead of 2024 though still more than 32% behind 2019.\nHurry Up Tomorrowstars The Weeknd as a fictionalized version of himself, teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown as he goes on a journey of self-discovery with a fan, played by Jenna Ortega. The story was inspired by a real-life incident where The Weeknd suddenly lost his voice during a show in Los Angeles at SoFi Stadium in 2022. The Grammy-winner has been open about his mental health struggles.\n“My anxiety is a constant battle, and I feel like it never goes away,” hesaid last year.“I’m learning to control it, but I’ve already realized that it’s part of my life. I can’t escape it.”\nThe movie, (which also stars Barry Keoghan), and album have been heavily publicized as artist Abel Tesfayeshedding “The Weeknd” as a persona.

        "description": "Dawn Montgomerylearned early that her voice could protect her or move mountains. At just 8 years old, she testified in open court against her father, who had been sexually abusing her. The decision to speak up — sparked by a concerned classmate and a teacher who took her seriously — shook her family. But even then, Montgomery understood the power of telling the truth and standing by it.\n“I stood on what I said. I didn’t ever change anything,” she said. That moment became the foundation for everything that followed — personally, politically and professionally.\nBorn in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and raised between Ohio and the Deep South, Montgomery’s path to media was shaped by survival and storytelling. She earned an associate’s degree from Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, and later a bachelor’s from Oglethorpe University in Atlanta.\nHer media journey started with a red pencil and her grandmother’s community columns for the local paper. By age 12, she was editing articles about local issues and advocacy. “I got a job. I got responsibilities,” she recalled. “You can't say nothing to me in school now.”Montgomery didn’t arrive in journalism through a straight line. Before reporting,she spent 15 years modeling. She traveled the world, appeared in fashion campaigns, and even graced the coveted page 43 ofJETmagazine as a Beauty of the Week. After stepping away from modeling, she shifted into media and quickly built a reputation as a sharp, community-focused voice in sports and culture.In recent years, Montgomery has continued building her voice across journalism, strategy, and cultural commentary, growing a dedicated audience on X (formerly Twitter). She’s worked with legacy media outlets, consulted for nonprofits and businesses, and stayed active in the sports world she’s long been part of.Photo by Okayplayer.In 2023, she exited as host of the podcastMonuments to MeatRevoltin response to the sexual assaultallegations against Diddy.

        "description": "As a mother raising a Black boy, I’m beginning to understand something I wasn’t always taught to prioritize: the power of Black male mentorship. The kind that shows up not just as discipline, but as presence. Patience. Guidance. Vulnerability. There’s a real gap in how we support our sons and a deeper one in how we support the men they grow into.\nPhoto courtesy of Phil Agnew.Phil’s sense of community runs deep. “I grew up, I’m the son of preachers and teachers,” he told me. “My school was right down the street from my house. My mother worked at my school. My grandmother worked at my school. All my teachers, my mom knew them for like 20 years.” His entire world — school, church, even his first girlfriend — was rooted in relationships, family and familiarity. “I don’t know anything but community,” he shares. “I don’t know how to survive and thrive without having that.”Still, mentorship beyond family ties was something he craved. “I didn’t really have [it] until I went to FAMU and I joined a fraternity and I had other people around me,” he says. “Other people would tell me when I’m erring and not on my square, or I’m operating in a plane that’s beneath me. There are role models and there are inspirations, but mentorship is a little bit more intentional.”That intentionality is something Black Men Build is working to scale. Their men’s circles offer collective mentorship; spaces where brothers share experiences, lessons and accountability. But the need runs deeper, especially for the next generation. “I always yearned for it,” Phil said. “It’s not automatic.”We talked about the loneliness epidemic among men, thesobering suicide ratefor Black boys, and how social media compounds it all. “The internet is exacerbating the alienation, the isolation, the individualism, the consumerism, the [comparisons] to another person.” But it’s not new, he said. “For the last 400 years, we have faced this same crisis of capitalism, white supremacy and patriarchy. That is a dehumanizing culture to live in.”So what do Black boys need? “We need revolution,” he told me. “Cliché, right? But what Black boys need, and what I wish I had, was a plethora, a variety, a cornucopia, a diversity, a litany of different images of what it means to be a grown or older person like them.”But none of this happens in a vacuum. Phil doesn’t just want boys to be told they can cry. “We don’t say this enough, but you should also be able to laugh,” he says. “I grew up in a community where if you laugh too much, [people] would be like, ‘You goofy.’”That freedom, emotional, spiritual, and cultural, can’t happen without safety. “You kind of gotta ask, low-key,” he said of mentorship. “I think for there to be a real mentorship relationship, there should be a level of like, ‘Hey brother, I see something in you that I think I would like more of to model in myself. Can you help me along that path?’”Phil isn’t just thinking about systems; he’s doing the inner work, too. “I had to face myself in a way that I had never had to do before. Why do you fear or hate being alone so much? Why do you look for so much validation outside of yourself?”As our conversation concluded, Phil hardped on how vulnerability can’t be expected unless it’s made safe and modeled by a trusted source. “We are trying to do [that],” he said, “Show that there is not one way to be a man.”\nPhoto courtesy of Phil Agnew.\nPhil’s sense of community runs deep. “I grew up, I’m the son of preachers and teachers,” he told me. “My school was right down the street from my house.

Appropriately, this year’s highlights were fashion-forward Black men: Pharrell Williams, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and Lewis Hamilton.\nHere are some of our favorite looks and moments.\nColman Domingo’s dripColman Domingo and Lewis Hamilton, Met Gala Co-Chairs, attend the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City.Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images.He’s become known as one of the most fashion-forward men in entertainment, and the acclaimed actor didn’t disappoint.

        "title": "Anime and Hip-Hop Have Always Been Speaking The Same Language",
        "description": "For a certain generation of Black kids — the ones who still remember recording songs off the radio with blank cassette tapes — anime didn’t arrive through old manga volumes or imported VHS tapes. It crash-landed into our livesevery afternoon on Cartoon Network, wrapped in the spacey, metallic branding of Toonami.\nIf you were a millennial with half an ear to hip-hop and half an eye on after-school TV, Toonami wasn't just a programming block. It was a portal to some of the greatest moments and stories ever told that you’ve ever seen throughout your young adulthood. Personally, my finger was often on the remote during commercials, flipping between Goku finally landing on Planet Namek and music videos onBET’sRap City. But Toonami was appointment television.\nPart of what made the connection feel so natural during the time was that Toonami itself moved like hip-hop. It wasn’t just the shows, but it was the overall atmosphere. The spacey visuals, the grainy low-end beats under every bumper, with the laid-back voice of T.O.M talking slick between commercials. It felt closer to a mixtape than a TV block. Toonami also didn’t feel the need to talk down to us watching, but instead trusted the audience to catch the rhythm, attitudes and stakes between the bumpers. Toonami earned our trust as an audience by understanding the youth culture it was targeting.But it wasn't just Toonami’s aesthetic that locked us in. It was the way these shows treated things like ambition. Goku didn’t want to win tournaments just to win — he trained until his body broke down because he needed to be stronger tomorrow than he was today. He fought for his friends, his family, his planet. You didn't need a crash course in Eastern philosophy to understand that. There was no need to translate the idea of leveling up. There was no need to explain why a fighter would yell and scream just to push past a wall that felt permanent. We already knew what that was. Anime, at least the anime that mattered to us, was about labor and effort. It was about keeping your head up, which feels so ingrained within our own culture.So when hip-hop started openly embracing anime, it didn’t feel like a crossover event — it felt like something inevitable. RZA had already cracked the code by the mid-'90s with Wu-Tang, turning kung fu flicks into rap mythology. For many in the new millennium, that honor belongs without a doubtto Lupe Fiasco. One of the first anime references I remember hearing in a song came from Lupe on the 2005 Kanye West single, “Touch the Sky” —“Guess who's on third, Lupe steal like Lupin the Third.”Kanye’s anime influence would become even more prominent on his follow-up album,Graduation, which featured heavy nods to Katsuhiro Otomo’sAkirain the video for “Stronger,” along with an anime-inspired video for “Good Morning,” based on album artwork created by Takashi Murakami.The floodgates opened after that, with anime references pouring in from all our favorite rappers and singers. Lil Uzi Vert (“New Patek”), Ski Mask the Slump God (“Lost Souls”), Isaiah Rashad “Wats Wrong”), Frank Ocean (“Pink Matter”) and more, all proudly wove anime into their work. Soon, hip-hop would recognize anime as kin. Anime would become another lens through which we could talk about struggle, ego, power and loss.But if there’s one rapper who took the connection further, it’s Megan Thee Stallion. She doesn’t just name-drop her favorite shows —she embodies them. Whether it was cosplaying as Shoto Todoroki (aptly titling herself as Todoroki Tina) fromMy Hero Academia, dressing as Sailor Moon for a trip to Tokyo, or flexing her love forNaruto,One Piece,Jujutsu KaisenandJoJo's Bizarre Adventureon social media and in songs (“BOA”), Megan made anime a part of her whole identity as a superstar. It isn’t performative either — you can tell she is a genuine fan, talking about her favorite characters and arcs the same way any of us would. She shows that anime isn’t just something Black kids liked growing up, it is something we could proudly carry into adulthood, into our art, into our full selves.Effie Wambui, wearing a costume of character Jotaro Kujo from Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, poses after attending the cosplay contest at Japan Information and Culture Centre in Nairobi, on December 9, 2017.Photo by YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images.Cosplay naturally grew right alongside anime’s explosion in the Black community, even if the road wasn’t always smooth. For a long time, Black cosplayers faced gatekeeping and subtle (and not-so-subtle) racism at conventions and online, getting questioned or criticized for embodying characters who weren’t \"supposed\" to look like them. But, like everything else, we flipped the narrative. Black cosplayers showed up as whoever they wanted — storming into anime cons dressed as Naruto, Sailor Scouts,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventurecharacters — and brought their own flavor to the scene. Today, the presence of Black cosplayers is vibrant, undeniable and essential to the culture.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Kayla 🪄 (@rinnegoddess)Now we’ve created spaces of our own, with conventions like Blerdcon and RDCWorld1’s DreamCon — a Black-owned anime convention that draws thousands every year. These gatherings aren’t just about celebrating anime; they’re about celebrating the way we experience, remix, and build community around it. The cosplay meetups, rap battles, artist alleys, gaming tournaments, and panel conversations all feel like they could only happen in our world. They’re proof that the connection between hip-hop, Black culture, and anime isn’t just alive — it’s thriving.Anime has been global for decades — but hip-hop, and Black culture specifically, gave it a second home. A second life. We didn’t just watch anime. We absorbed it, broke it down, flipped it, and remixed it the same way we’ve always done with the things we love. We turned favorite characters into metaphors, favorite storylines into survival tactics, favorite battles into anthems. Anime became another language we spoke — one rooted in ambition, struggle, and reinvention.\n\nPart of what made the connection feel so natural during the time was that Toonami itself moved like hip-hop. It wasn’t just the shows, but it was the overall atmosphere. The spacey visuals, the grainy low-end beats under every bumper, with the laid-back voice of T.O.M talking slick between commercials. It felt closer to a mixtape than a TV block. Toonami also didn’t feel the need to talk down to us watching, but instead trusted the audience to catch the rhythm, attitudes and stakes between the bumpers. Toonami earned our trust as an audience by understanding the youth culture it was targeting.\nBut it wasn't just Toonami’s aesthetic that locked us in. It was the way these shows treated things like ambition. Goku didn’t want to win tournaments just to win — he trained until his body broke down because he needed to be stronger tomorrow than he was today. He fought for his friends, his family, his planet. You didn't need a crash course in Eastern philosophy to understand that. There was no need to translate the idea of leveling up. There was no need to explain why a fighter would yell and scream just to push past a wall that felt permanent. We already knew what that was. Anime, at least the anime that mattered to us, was about labor and effort. It was about keeping your head up, which feels so ingrained within our own culture.\n\nSo when hip-hop started openly embracing anime, it didn’t feel like a crossover event — it felt like something inevitable. RZA had already cracked the code by the mid-'90s with Wu-Tang, turning kung fu flicks into rap mythology. For many in the new millennium, that honor belongs without a doubtto Lupe Fiasco. One of the first anime references I remember hearing in a song came from Lupe on the 2005 Kanye West single, “Touch the Sky” —“Guess who's on third, Lupe steal like Lupin the Third.”Kanye’s anime influence would become even more prominent on his follow-up album,Graduation, which featured heavy nods to Katsuhiro Otomo’sAkirain the video for “Stronger,” along with an anime-inspired video for “Good Morning,” based on album artwork created by Takashi Murakami.\nThe floodgates opened after that, with anime references pouring in from all our favorite rappers and singers. Lil Uzi Vert (“New Patek”), Ski Mask the Slump God (“Lost Souls”), Isaiah Rashad “Wats Wrong”), Frank Ocean (“Pink Matter”) and more, all proudly wove anime into their work. Soon, hip-hop would recognize anime as kin. Anime would become another lens through which we could talk about struggle, ego, power and loss.\n\nBut if there’s one rapper who took the connection further, it’s Megan Thee Stallion. She doesn’t just name-drop her favorite shows —she embodies them. Whether it was cosplaying as Shoto Todoroki (aptly titling herself as Todoroki Tina) fromMy Hero Academia, dressing as Sailor Moon for a trip to Tokyo, or flexing her love forNaruto,One Piece,Jujutsu KaisenandJoJo's Bizarre Adventureon social media and in songs (“BOA”), Megan made anime a part of her whole identity as a superstar. It isn’t performative either — you can tell she is a genuine fan, talking about her favorite characters and arcs the same way any of us would. She shows that anime isn’t just something Black kids liked growing up, it is something we could proudly carry into adulthood, into our art, into our full selves.\nEffie Wambui, wearing a costume of character Jotaro Kujo from Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, poses after attending the cosplay contest at Japan Information and Culture Centre in Nairobi, on December 9, 2017.\nPhoto by YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images.\nCosplay naturally grew right alongside anime’s explosion in the Black community, even if the road wasn’t always smooth. For a long time, Black cosplayers faced gatekeeping and subtle (and not-so-subtle) racism at conventions and online, getting questioned or criticized for embodying characters who weren’t \"supposed\" to look like them. But, like everything else, we flipped the narrative. Black cosplayers showed up as whoever they wanted — storming into anime cons dressed as Naruto, Sailor Scouts,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventurecharacters — and brought their own flavor to the scene. Today, the presence of Black cosplayers is vibrant, undeniable and essential to the culture.\nA post shared by Kayla 🪄 (@rinnegoddess)\nNow we’ve created spaces of our own, with conventions like Blerdcon and RDCWorld1’s DreamCon — a Black-owned anime convention that draws thousands every year. These gatherings aren’t just about celebrating anime; they’re about celebrating the way we experience, remix, and build community around it. The cosplay meetups, rap battles, artist alleys, gaming tournaments, and panel conversations all feel like they could only happen in our world. They’re proof that the connection between hip-hop, Black culture, and anime isn’t just alive — it’s thriving.\nAnime has been global for decades — but hip-hop, and Black culture specifically, gave it a second home. A second life. We didn’t just watch anime. We absorbed it, broke it down, flipped it, and remixed it the same way we’ve always done with the things we love. We turned favorite characters into metaphors, favorite storylines into survival tactics, favorite battles into anthems. Anime became another language we spoke — one rooted in ambition, struggle, and reinvention.",

Being in this business, you have to pick and choose to say you’re going to be mentally well. In it, things happen, and if you don't have control over your mind, you're going to snap. When I started my wellness journey, I was just making sure I was watching what I eat and watching what I drink. I was on the road trying to visit juice bars when I knew you can't eat fast food all day.I became more in tune with what's around me. All the chemicals in processed food can disturb you. Not everybody, but I think it affects some people in a different way. Everything on Earth is based on energy. I think the saying, ‘You are what you eat’ is absolutely the truth. It's inside your body, you ate it and now you have energy from something you eat. If a calf is ripped from the cow and then they rip the baby away, the cow knows you took its baby. Now when you kill it, the cow's depressed and now you’re eating meat that's depressed. I used to have post-nasal drip. I used to be overweight and used to have a bad temper. Eating clean helped me resolve all of those things.I'm 50 years old. Before people were talking about mental wellness, it was just, ‘That nigga's crazy,’ and that was it. For Black men coming up in the ’90s, you had to put your mind in a place to think better and move better, especially when you are able to make it from one place to another. The transition is so crazy and the things you're able to see are so crazy that you have to let your mind be strong enough to take what's going on with it. Back then, you chopped it up with your homeboys about how to get better, how to live better, your aspirations, your dreams, where you want to get to. I believe that was a positive mindstate to have. Things became advanced as time went on and people started talking about mental wellness and therapy. As time advances, technology advances; there's computers, there's social media sites where you could say, ‘Okay, I've seen therapy work for this guy. I've seen therapy work for this person and that person.’Everything starts with your brain. So I always look at it once your brain tells you to do something good and it works for you, even if it's physical and it works for you, that's your brain sending you on a journey for your body to feel better. I’ve experienced a lot of loss in my life. I’ve experienced happiness. I’ve accomplished goals I never thought I would. So the best way to deal with it all is to have your mental on a swivel. When your brain is doing what it needs to do and you’re mentally prepared to handle what life brings you.Mentally and physically, I’m always a work in progress. I'm good, but I could always be better. When I wake up, I'm blessed to be here. My mind is sound. I feel good, but I could be in better shape physically. I could be in better shape mentally. As long as I'm alive, I'm pretty sure that's going to be the case.

        "title": "\"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" – The 2025 Met Gala's Celebration of Black Dandyism",
        "description": "An outfit can be a powerful tool. It can unlock and open doors, and give us access to rooms. It can change how we are seen and change how we feel. It can simultaneously act as armor and art. As the steps to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art again transform into our favorite annual runway and what is sure to be a breathtaking tableau of fashion, talent, and artistry, the power of outfits will be on display. This year'sMet Galatheme, \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" dives deep into the history and meaning behind Black dandyism — showing how Black men have used fashion not just to stand out, but also to express themselves, push back against suppression, and shape their identities.\nBlack dandyism is far more than just sharp outfits — it's a cultural statement that's been around since the 1700s. It’s all about carefully crafted style used as a form of rebellion and self-definition. It's about mannerisms and the way Black men walk and carry themselves. Dandyism is about showing up and showing out, while also taking back and shifting power. It’s about Black excellence, jazz, elegance, attending church, grooming and longstanding personal relationships with your tailor.\nDapper Dan is seen outside \"Good Morning America\" on July 9, 2019 in New York City.Photo by Raymond Hall/GC Images.The Costume Institute’s new exhibit, put together by Andrew Bolton and scholar Monica L. Miller, digs into the evolution of Black men's style. It takes cues from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1934 essay\"Characteristics of Negro Expression,\"and looks at how Black men have used fashion to shape and express who they are across the African diaspora. It highlights how important clothing has been to Black identity, especially through the lens of Black dandyism — how it started, what it means, and how it’s spread.This year's dress code — \"Tailored for You\" — is all about putting a personal spin on menswear. Guests are encouraged to get creative, pulling inspiration from styles like the zoot suit, the vibrant fashion of Congolese sapeurs, or timeless pieces like canes and pocket squares. The idea is to show off the depth and variety of Black men’s fashion, with looks that reflect both personal style and cultural roots. Perhaps most interesting to see will be how the female guests, their stylists, and womenswear designers team up to interpret the theme and put their own spin on dandyism.The 2025 Met Gala will be led by an impressive group of co-chairs:Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton,A$AP RockyandColman Domingo, all of whom were a cover star for Vogue’s special May issue focusing on the Met. They will be joined by chairperson Anna Wintour, while LeBron James also steps in as an honorary co-chair. It’s a versatile crew that brings different experiences and styles to the table — perfect for a theme that celebrates the many sides of Black dandyism. The host committee is equally full of excellence, featuring names like Simone Biles, Sha’Carri Richardson,Usher,Janelle MonáeandAndré 3000.Outkast, with Andre 3000, perform at the \"18th Annual Soul Train Music Awards\" at the Scottish Rite Auditorium on March 20, 2004 in Los Angeles, California.Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images.The choice of Black dandyism as this year's focus shows that the Met Gala is serious about highlighting the connections between style, identity, and culture. By putting the spotlight on Black men's fashion, it also gives credit where it’s long overdue — acknowledging the major impact Black creatives have had on fashion. The always highly anticipated event is a reminder that clothing isn’t just threads and fabrics — it’s also a powerful form of storytelling, identity, and cultural pride. From the exhibit to the red carpet, this year’s event encourages everyone to dive into the vibrant history behind Black men’s style, highlighting the lasting power of fashion as a form of resistance, pride, and self-expression in the community.\nDapper Dan is seen outside \"Good Morning America\" on July 9, 2019 in New York City.\nPhoto by Raymond Hall/GC Images.\nThe Costume Institute’s new exhibit, put together by Andrew Bolton and scholar Monica L.

Perhaps most interesting to see will be how the female guests, their stylists, and womenswear designers team up to interpret the theme and put their own spin on dandyism.\nOutkast, with Andre 3000, perform at the \"18th Annual Soul Train Music Awards\" at the Scottish Rite Auditorium on March 20, 2004 in Los Angeles, California.\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images.\nThe choice of Black dandyism as this year's focus shows that the Met Gala is serious about highlighting the connections between style, identity, and culture. By putting the spotlight on Black men's fashion, it also gives credit where it’s long overdue — acknowledging the major impact Black creatives have had on fashion. The always highly anticipated event is a reminder that clothing isn’t just threads and fabrics — it’s also a powerful form of storytelling, identity, and cultural pride. From the exhibit to the red carpet, this year’s event encourages everyone to dive into the vibrant history behind Black men’s style, highlighting the lasting power of fashion as a form of resistance, pride, and self-expression in the community.",

        "title": "How Hike Clerb's Evelynn Escobar Reclaimed the Outdoors and Redefined Wellness",
        "description": "Sometimes, one small act can open up an entire world. ForEvelynn Escobar, that act was hiking up to Griffith Observatory with her aunt at age 10. It was the first time she’d really seen nature as something to step into, not just something around her. “That’s when I saw the hiking trails and it was just like, wow — nature,” she said in an interview. The moment sparked something she couldn’t yet name, but it planted a seed that would change everything.\nEvelynn grew up in Northern Virginia, just minutes from a state park she never visited. The idea of hiking there alone didn’t feel safe, much less welcoming. “People were not inviting me to go out there to do that,” she said. Still, she spent plenty of time in the woods and creeks near home, spaces that connected her to nature even if no one called it that. “I didn’t feel scared in there,” she remembered. “Unconsciously, I was having that connection.”\nPhoto byYasmina Antonio.It wasn’t until a cross-country road trip in her early 20s that she truly saw how exclusive outdoor culture could be. At ZionNational Parkin Utah, she felt the gaze of strangers who made it clear: You don’t belong here. That tension lit a fire. As someone with Indigenous roots on both sides, Evelynnknewshe belonged. “Black people are Indigenous to a place,” she said. “And my ancestry on the side that is native to Guatemala — we are literally people of the sun.” That legacy, and her lived experience as a Black and Guatemalan woman, grounds everything she builds. “We are people of this earth,” she said. “Healing that connection with the land is so pivotal to our own healing experience and also to our connection to our ancestors.”Reconnecting to the earth eventually inspired Evelyn to share the love. In 2017, she posted on Twitter (now X): “Hey y’all, I’m going to start a hiking club. Does anyone want to come?” Ten people did. With that, Hike Clerb was born. Since then, what started as one small meet-up has grown into a national nonprofit with programs in L.A., New York, and the Bay Area. Today, Hike Clerb hosts outdoor events, youth programs, wellness retreats, and community hikes, all grounded in a mission to center Black and brown women and nonbinary folks in the outdoors.The pandemic brought new momentum. “In 2020, white people discovered Black people, and everybody discovered nature,” Evelynn joked. As the world shut down, Hike Clerb became a space of refuge, healing, and connection for the community and for Evelynn herself.But leading that space also came with a cost. In building Hike Clerb, Evelynn often put the needs of others before her own. Motherhood forced her to rethink that. During her first pregnancy, she severed ties with her mother and found herself grieving while stepping into a new life. Nature became her sanctuary. “I still have a mother, and that mother is actually nature,” she said. “She’s always holding me.” It’s where she learned to release, to reset, and to be held — sometimes by rivers, sometimes by trees.Now, Evelynn brings her daughter, who’s nearing four, everywhere. “She was already getting all of that exposure in the womb,” she said. “She’s essentially my co-founder at this point.” Hike Clerb events welcome families, loud toddlers, strollers, and the beautiful mess of real life. “We live in a world that has segmented us so much from allowing children to be the little humans that they are, but here they are accepted and they're welcomed.”It’s a full-circle moment. Evelynn was once the kid who entered a space the world told her wasn’t meant for her. Now, she’s creating spaces where people of color are not only welcome but deeply rooted. Where healing happens in motion, in community, and in the quiet wisdom of the land.In Evelynn’s world, wholeness is wellness, and everyone belongs.\nPhoto byYasmina Antonio.\nIt wasn’t until a cross-country road trip in her early 20s that she truly saw how exclusive outdoor culture could be.

        "title": "How the Legalization of Cannabis Revolutionized Communal Wellness",
        "description": "Cannabis once incurred a reputation as a gateway drug. Back in the ‘70s and ‘80s, at the height of the “Just Say No” era, a war on drugs campaign, recreational drug use was discouraged. Cannabis in particular was likened to possess the same habit-forming traits as other addictive drugs like meth, cocaine and heroin. Over the years, cannabis has continued to elicit these negative connotations, especially with its long-storied history with the hip-hop genre and ‘80s slacker movies depicting stoners as lazy people. But these precarious labels haven’t deterred cannabis use, nor has it stopped states like California, Oregon, New York and others from legalizing the plant for both medical and recreational use. Now,almost half of all Americansbelieve that cannabis should be legal, with many claiming that it strengthens the economy and our communities.\nFewer people are drinking overall, but especially young people. Gen-Z, known as the “dry generation,” has gone sober, opting for mocktails, prebiotic sodas like Olipop and Poppi, or the wellness non alcoholic drinks fromKin Euphorics, instead of beer or wine. Compared to previous generations, Gen-Z abstains from alcohol and is shifting towards activities that support their well-being and mental health. Gen-Z is pioneering their own version of wellness, which is paradoxical to their increased presence in virtual spaces. According to research from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, drinking among young people began to decline around the year 2000. A2023 survey from Galluprevealed that a percentage of adults under the age of 35 who say they have never had a drink dropped 10 percentage points to 62 percent in 2021-2023.But while they may be refraining from drinking alcohol, the younger generation still opts for cannabis and other drug usage.Almost 80 percent of Americans livewithin a county with a dispensary, and cannabis-infused drinks are marketed towards younger consumers, boasting about the wellness benefits. Despite the decline in drinking, there is no clear correlation that this means that younger people have a preference for drugs. But the consequences of drinking — hangovers, weight gain and alcoholism — outweigh any potential benefits.Bryson Wells, an account executive atKiva Confections,had noticed these shifts in consumption. Wells began his career in the wine and spirits industry in 2019. The wine and spirits industry has been well established for over a hundred years, dating back to the Prohibition Era, but in recent years, sales have declined.“So I looked at this chart randomly, and it showed that the pace of alcohol sales have been declining over the past five years since the pandemic,” Wells said “Sales of cannabis had been on the incline, and sometime last year was the first time it was at a crossroads, where the sales of cannabis outpaced alcohol, which sounds kind of crazy.”Alcohol use has always been controversial. Like any substance, there is a risk of abusing that substance and hurting someone as a result. For younger people, who have witnessed the damage that comes with abusing alcohol, cannabis, thought not with its own risks, appears a safer option. Wells, who was surprised by the rise of the cannabis industry, started looking into making the transition. Initially, he looked for jobs in California, just before the pandemic, as the state is known in particular for cannabis, but it didn’t work out.Fast-forward to 2021, when New York legalized the sale of both medicinal and recreational marijuana. A few years later, both legal and illegal dispensaries began popping up around the city, presenting an opportunity for Wells to make the switch to the cannabis industry.“I found out that the brand that I was interested in actually had jobs available here in New York, and around this same time, the company I was working for would send out reports on other industries that kind of run parallel to us, like tobacco,” Wells said. “I transitioned to cannabis because it's a growing industry, extremely, extremely fast-growing industry. And yeah, it feels like I'm here at the ground level.”The shift from wine and spirits to the cannabis industry revealed many insights. For Wells, he noticed that his particular clientele areolder adults, aged 45 to 60.In their generation, cannabis was frowned upon, but as cannabis isn’t limited to just smoking, they enter the store looking for a variety of products. As the industry has evolved, there are edibles, gummies, THC-infused drinks, and more. From the cannabis connoisseur to those who are just curious, the cannabis industry can accommodate anyone.During this age of wellness, where everyone is considerably concerned with what they put into their body, cannabis has emerged as a potentially morehealthy alternativeto pain medication or other mass-manufactured drugs. Wells, who is a distance runner, claims there are specific benefits of cannabis use for muscle recovery.“Most of my recovery is centered around cannabis and CBD. So it's a cannabinoid that's in the marijuana leaf called CBG [that may be helpful] for swelling and chronic pain,” Wells said. “So with my company [Kiva], we have a chew that's called freshly squeezed, and it has a CBG in it as well as THC. Of course, it'll give you that high, but it's more so geared towards 'recovery,' after a workout.”“Multiple people say they take it for stomach pain or GI issues because it helps them sleep, it takes away the pain, and stuff like that. So that's just my outlook, or just my personal experience.”But these shifts aren’t just limited to the people that Wells serves. The legalization of cannabis in some states has shifted a conversation around cannabis use and its effects. The majority of the public also believes that cannabis is less harmful than tobacco, nicotine and alcohol. Some claim cannabis use has eased their chronic pain, reducing depression and anxiety. Stress has been the comprehensive characteristic over the past decade, from dealing with the chaotic Trump presidency (twice), a worldwide pandemic and the widening wealth gap. One can't verify a direct correlation between these stressors and increasing marijuana use, but wanting to lift the world’s weight off your shoulders could be the reason some turn to cannabis to ease everyday stressors.Despite positive shifts in attitudes towards cannabis use, a subset of people still have negative thoughts towards cannabis. While there are a small number of dispensaries in New York City (approximately 85 legal shops) and around156 legal shops around the state, there are still many counties in the state that refuse to endorse the use of cannabis.“You'll see that Long Island only has about five to six dispensaries, legal dispensaries. Four of them are only in Farmingdale, New York. That’s because that’s the only county that spearheaded going forward with opening up new dispensaries,” Wells explained. “So that just kind of shows that the perception of it is still negative. But the politician there that didn't want to bring in these dispensaries is now seeing the profits it’s bringing to this county, and now he's all for it.”Although the country has adopted a more progressive view on cannabis, there are still more conservative people who seem to deride any progress until there is an opportunity to make money. Last year, New York Governor Kathy Hochul celebrated New York crossing abillion-dollarmilestone in retail sales. Possibly, presenting the profitability of cannabis can incentivize other political leaders to legalize within their states.Hip-hop, in particular, has cultivated a communal spirit towards the evolution of cannabis culture. Across several decades, cannabis has been the muse of hip-hop and vice versa. Both cannabis and hip-hop have faced dissenting views in the eyes of the mainstream, and both have evolved into billion-dollar industries. Artists like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have built their brands off the popularity of the plant, and the merging of cannabis with the genre has presented opportunities for entrepreneurship, leading to jobs. One could argue that hip-hop’s relationship with cannabis helped spur the legitimization of the industry. Across the country, there are resources for people to enter the cannabis industry, especially for people who have been charged with possession in the past. Shifting the stigma surrounding cannabis use doesn’t just open up new business opportunities, but allows those who have been shunned by the system a second chance. Ultimately, these shifts can’t occur without educating the community about the benefits they reap from the legalization.“[There’s] a lot of negative still out there, but the positive is definitely steamrolling [change], and that comes along with the education of cannabis,” Wells said. “And that's what a lot of people in our industry try to put out there, as far as transitioning that negative stigmatism to a positive, it's just by educating their consumer.”\nFewer people are drinking overall, but especially young people.

A few years later, both legal and illegal dispensaries began popping up around the city, presenting an opportunity for Wells to make the switch to the cannabis industry.\n“I found out that the brand that I was interested in actually had jobs available here in New York, and around this same time, the company I was working for would send out reports on other industries that kind of run parallel to us, like tobacco,” Wells said. “I transitioned to cannabis because it's a growing industry, extremely, extremely fast-growing industry. And yeah, it feels like I'm here at the ground level.”\nThe shift from wine and spirits to the cannabis industry revealed many insights. For Wells, he noticed that his particular clientele areolder adults, aged 45 to 60.In their generation, cannabis was frowned upon, but as cannabis isn’t limited to just smoking, they enter the store looking for a variety of products. As the industry has evolved, there are edibles, gummies, THC-infused drinks, and more. From the cannabis connoisseur to those who are just curious, the cannabis industry can accommodate anyone.\nDuring this age of wellness, where everyone is considerably concerned with what they put into their body, cannabis has emerged as a potentially morehealthy alternativeto pain medication or other mass-manufactured drugs. Wells, who is a distance runner, claims there are specific benefits of cannabis use for muscle recovery.\n“Most of my recovery is centered around cannabis and CBD. So it's a cannabinoid that's in the marijuana leaf called CBG [that may be helpful] for swelling and chronic pain,” Wells said. “So with my company [Kiva], we have a chew that's called freshly squeezed, and it has a CBG in it as well as THC. Of course, it'll give you that high, but it's more so geared towards 'recovery,' after a workout.”\n“Multiple people say they take it for stomach pain or GI issues because it helps them sleep, it takes away the pain, and stuff like that. So that's just my outlook, or just my personal experience.”\nBut these shifts aren’t just limited to the people that Wells serves. The legalization of cannabis in some states has shifted a conversation around cannabis use and its effects. The majority of the public also believes that cannabis is less harmful than tobacco, nicotine and alcohol. Some claim cannabis use has eased their chronic pain, reducing depression and anxiety. Stress has been the comprehensive characteristic over the past decade, from dealing with the chaotic Trump presidency (twice), a worldwide pandemic and the widening wealth gap. One can't verify a direct correlation between these stressors and increasing marijuana use, but wanting to lift the world’s weight off your shoulders could be the reason some turn to cannabis to ease everyday stressors.\nDespite positive shifts in attitudes towards cannabis use, a subset of people still have negative thoughts towards cannabis. While there are a small number of dispensaries in New York City (approximately 85 legal shops) and around156 legal shops around the state, there are still many counties in the state that refuse to endorse the use of cannabis.\n“You'll see that Long Island only has about five to six dispensaries, legal dispensaries. Four of them are only in Farmingdale, New York. That’s because that’s the only county that spearheaded going forward with opening up new dispensaries,” Wells explained. “So that just kind of shows that the perception of it is still negative. But the politician there that didn't want to bring in these dispensaries is now seeing the profits it’s bringing to this county, and now he's all for it.”\nAlthough the country has adopted a more progressive view on cannabis, there are still more conservative people who seem to deride any progress until there is an opportunity to make money. Last year, New York Governor Kathy Hochul celebrated New York crossing abillion-dollarmilestone in retail sales. Possibly, presenting the profitability of cannabis can incentivize other political leaders to legalize within their states.\nHip-hop, in particular, has cultivated a communal spirit towards the evolution of cannabis culture. Across several decades, cannabis has been the muse of hip-hop and vice versa. Both cannabis and hip-hop have faced dissenting views in the eyes of the mainstream, and both have evolved into billion-dollar industries. Artists like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have built their brands off the popularity of the plant, and the merging of cannabis with the genre has presented opportunities for entrepreneurship, leading to jobs. One could argue that hip-hop’s relationship with cannabis helped spur the legitimization of the industry. Across the country, there are resources for people to enter the cannabis industry, especially for people who have been charged with possession in the past. Shifting the stigma surrounding cannabis use doesn’t just open up new business opportunities, but allows those who have been shunned by the system a second chance. Ultimately, these shifts can’t occur without educating the community about the benefits they reap from the legalization.\n“[There’s] a lot of negative still out there, but the positive is definitely steamrolling [change], and that comes along with the education of cannabis,” Wells said. “And that's what a lot of people in our industry try to put out there, as far as transitioning that negative stigmatism to a positive, it's just by educating their consumer.”",

        "title": "Welcome Home: Inside the Wellness Oasis Black Brooklyn Built",
        "description": "At the corner of Crown Heights and Bed-Stuy, wellness looks like a curated retail shelf, a spiced ground rib-eye burger, and the sweet silence of a private facial. For over a decade, Nilea Alexander has built that vision — first withCafé Rue Dix, then Marché Rue Dix, and now, with a space for full-service beauty and wellness services.\n“It wasn’t so much about what I was going to be doing when I opened,” she said, “as much as what I was going to be providing. I knew I wanted to provide an environment — a community environment — something that was really cool.” The goal was to create a space rooted in Brooklyn, shaped by culture, and built for people of color — where good vibes and good service weren’t mutually exclusive. A place where everyone is welcome, and Black folks can feel cared for without having to explain themselves.\nOver the years, the vision expanded — naturally. From vintage clothes to personal care products to nail services and facials, each addition was driven by both creativity and community need. During the pandemic, while many businesses shuttered, Nilea pivoted. “Adaptability is what I'll say was our savior,” she said. “The moment they said, ‘Oh, you can eat outside,’ people were building pickup windows. You had to move really fast. And that’s kind of what we did.”\nPhoto byBertram Knight.Nilea knows her shop has something for everyone — from skincare to vintage belts to housewares — but when she expanded into wellness services, she had a specific customer in mind. “She wants good quality service. She doesn't want to have to compromise on good quality service because she's in her neighborhood,” Nilea said.That clarity shaped the way she built out her spa and salon: professional, beautiful and rooted in the community it serves. No shortcuts. No watered-down experience. Just care, done right.For herself, Nilea describes wellness as about intentionality and presence. “Wellness is the act of choosing to care for yourself,” she said. That might mean doing her full skincare routine after a long day, carving out ten minutes to move her body, or — ideally — getting her hair shampooed and then enjoying a spiced ground rib-eye burger in a private salon suite. “Food is my communication. It's my love language. It's my wellness.”But it’s not just about services — it’s about being seen. “Black people, you found you. Welcome home,” Nilea said. In a city where luxury often comes with a side of erasure, her space insists on comfort without code-switching. To walk in, be greeted by someone who understands your lived experience, and not have to explain your skin, your hair, or your presence — that’s a form of wellness too. Belonging, Nilea reminds us, is a basic need. And at Marché Rue Dix, it’s built into the atmosphere.Photo byBertram Knight.\nPhoto byBertram Knight.\nNilea knows her shop has something for everyone — from skincare to vintage belts to housewares — but when she expanded into wellness services, she had a specific customer in mind. “She wants good quality service.

        "title": "Black Wrestlers Are No Longer Playing Roles, They’re Playing Themselves",
        "description": "Every Black wrestling fan of this modern era remembers where they were on April 7, 2019. I certainly do. After spending a weekend running around New York City from WaleMania to WrestleMania Axxess and NXT Takeover: New York, it was finally time for the biggest show of the weekend – WrestleMania 35.\nI wasn’t in the building, though. A week of fighting with Ticketmaster and watching resale prices skyrocket meant I had to tap out on getting a ticket. (An issue that, five years later, is still a problem, by the way.) But missing the event? Not an option. Kofi Kingston was fighting for the WWE Championship.\nKofi Kingston is a character who can summarize the shift in direction for Black wrestlers over the last decade. On his initial debut on the now-defunct television showECW on SyFy, Kofi Kingston was a fun-loving, thunder-clapping Jamaican pro wrestler who won over crowds with moves like “Trouble in Paradise” and the “Boom Drop.” He even had a signature call from then-commentator Mike Adamle, who excitedly declared he was “Jamaican me crazy!” And yes, it was as cringeworthy then as it is now. Unfortunately for history’s sake, Kofi Kingston wasn’t actually Jamaican (sorry if you’re learning this for the first time, but the accent should’ve definitely tipped you off).Eventually, WWE dropped the gimmick, Kofi Kingstondropped the accent, and he started being billed from Ghana, West Africa — his actual birthplace. For over a decade, Kofi was a fan favorite, always in the mix for the perennial midcard opportunities like the Intercontinental and Tag Team championships, but never really seen as a top guy. Then, after years of grinding and winning over the crowd, the stars finally aligned for what we now call KofiMania.That night, he faced Daniel Bryan, the smug, eco-friendly WWE Champion who was dead set on crushing his dreams. And in one of the most emotional moments in wrestling history: Kofi won the big one. I firmly remember the moment standing in front of my television, with a tear in my eye, watching history happen as his New Day stablemates Big E and Xavier Woods raised him up on their shoulders. They were also emotional. I was watching history happen, witnessing only the second Black WWE Champion in the company’s then-66-year history. Black wrestling fans everywhere were feeling the exact same way. It wasn’t just about Kofi — it was about all of us. For so long, WWE had rarely let Black wrestlers be the face of the company, and now? The glass ceiling had been shattered.And that win wasn’t just a one-off. Over the next few years, Bobby Lashley, Big E, Bianca Belair, Mercedes Moné and Swerve Strickland all followed. Wrestling has always been a reflection of culture, and just like award shows and major industries were finally acknowledging diversity, wrestling was shifting too. But it wasn’t always like this.Wrestling has always been a spectacle, but for Black wrestlers, that spectacle came with a catch. For decades, their place in the industry was defined by gimmicks that weren’t just outdated — they were outright damaging. If you were a Black wrestler in the ’80s, ’90s, or even the early 2000s, chances were you weren’t stepping into the ring as a fully realized character. You were stepping into a trope.Kamalawas a \"savage\" from Uganda, presented as an unthinking brute who slapped his belly and needed a white manager to speak for him. The Godfather, who once played the ridiculous voodoo priest Papa Shango, was rebranded as a flamboyant pimp leading a parade of women to the ring. Cryme Tyme was a two-man crime wave — stealing, looting, scamming and playing up every gangsta movie cliché imaginable. The formula was simple: Black wrestlers weren’t booked as serious competitors; they were side attractions, comic relief, or threats that needed to be tamed.These gimmicks worked in the worst way possible. Fans bought in. They cheered, they laughed, they played along. But that buy-in came at a cost. Wrestling is a business of perception — who looks like a star, who looks like a champion. And for decades, the message to Black wrestlers was clear: You could be on the card, but you’d never be the guy.And yet, despite the limitations, some Black wrestlers forced the industry to take them seriously. They weren’t just gimmicks, they were stars. Take Junkyard Dog (JYD) for instance. In the territorial days of wrestling throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, when Black wrestlers were often booked as secondary attractions, JYD became the main event draw in Mid-South Wrestling. Fans — Black and white — packed arenas to see him. He wasn’t a shucking, jiving caricature; he was a powerhouse with undeniable charisma.Then came Ron Simmons. By the early ’90s, WCW gave him the moment WWE (then WWF) never would: in 1992, he became the first Black world champion of a major wrestling promotion. It was a landmark win, but it wasn’t a full culture shift. WCW never quite built the company around Simmons, and he eventually left for WWE, where he found success — but under another questionable gimmick: Faarooq, first as a Roman gladiator (for some reason) and later as the militant leader of the Nation of Domination. The Nation of Domination was one of WWE’s first attempts to present Black wrestlers as more than stereotypes, though still through a controversial militant lens. While the Nation played into certain tropes, it also provided a platform for stars like D’Lo Brown, Mark Henry and, most notably, The Rock.The conversation around The Rock’s Blackness has always been complex. His Samoan heritage is often front and center, but make no mistake: Dwayne Johnson is a Black man who grew up in a Black wrestling family. His father, Rocky Johnson, was a trailblazer in his own right, one-half of WWE’s first Black tag team champions with Tony Atlas. When The Rock debuted in WWE as the smiling, blue-chipper babyface Rocky Maivia, fans rejected him. Hard. But when he flipped the switch, embracing his arrogance and natural charisma, he became the biggest star in wrestling history.The Rock wasn’t just a Black wrestler who succeeded — he transcended wrestling itself. He was undeniable, to the point that WWE didn’t even have a choice but to build the company around him. But even with all his success, his rise didn’timmediatelyopen doors for other Black wrestlers. WWE was willing to push The Rock astheguy, but they weren’t yet willing to invest in Black talent as a whole.And then there’s Booker T, arguably the most significant Black wrestler of the late ’90s and early 2000s. His story wasn’t just about breaking through wrestling’s barriers — it was about breaking through life’s. Before wrestling, Booker had a troubled past, even serving time in prison. Wrestling became his way out. He started in Texas’ independent scene before getting his big break in WCW alongside his brother, Stevie Ray, as Harlem Heat — a team that, yes, leaned into stereotypes but also dominated WCW’s tag team division.But Booker wasn’t just a tag wrestler — he hadit. The charisma, the in-ring skill, the ability to connect with a crowd. And as WCW’s popularity and status in the business began to collapse in 2000, he emerged as WCW Champion — one of the final phases of the company before WWE bought it. When he made the jump to WWE, it wasn’t an easy road. He endured more questionable booking, including the infamous Triple H storyline that suggested he wasn’t “champion material” leading to a gut-punching defeat at WrestleMania XIX, but he kept proving people wrong. By the time he reinvented himself as King Booker, he wasn’t just a great Black wrestler — he was one of the best wrestlers in the world. Period.For Black women in wrestling, the climb has been just as steep — if not steeper. Historically, Black female wrestlers were either sidelined or forced into limiting roles. Sapphire, best known as Dusty Rhodes’ manager in the late ’80s, was more of a novelty act than a wrestler. In the ’90s, Jacqueline shattered some barriers — she was a fierce competitor who won the WWE Women’s Championship twice and even held the men’s Cruiserweight Title, but she was rarely treated as a top star. Jazz, a powerhouse in the early 2000s, brought legitimacy to the women’s division but never received the same push as her white counterparts.During the 2000s, TNA (Total Nonstop Action) emerged as an alternative pro wrestling promotion to the WWE product and Awesome Kong (Kia Stevens) became a trailblazer for Black women in wrestling. Upon arrival, she quickly established herself as a dominant force in the Knockouts division, breaking away from the typical \"diva\" stereotypes that the industry clung to at the time. Kong’s intense, powerhouse style and commanding presence gave her credibility. She became the first Black woman to hold the TNA Knockouts Championship, reshaping the narrative for women of color in the industry. Kong’s success marked a significant step forward, but one that wouldn’t fully turn the tide for Black women.By the late 2000s, Alicia Fox became the first Black woman to win the Divas Championship – the company’s third Black women’s champion in its history and roughly the only one for about a decade. But her reign was brief, and she was often cast in chaotic, underdeveloped storylines. Meanwhile, The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi) were introduced as dancers for Brodus Clay. Though Naomi would later break out, this period underscored WWE’s reluctance to push Black women beyond sidekick roles. Before the coining of the Women’s Revolution, Black female wrestlers had the talent, but rarely the opportunity to be seen as legitimate headliners.Over the last decade, the wrestling landscape has undergone a major shift. If there’s a term to define this era for Black talent, it’s The Authentic Era. Fans and wrestlers from marginalized communities began rejecting the old idea that their heroes had to be limited to stereotypical roles. Culturally, the broader push for diverse representation in entertainment, sports, and beyond fueled the demand for more authentic, multifaceted portrayals of Black athletes. Movements like Black Lives Matter and the fight for racial equity sparked conversations about systemic inequality, leading to a demand for more meaningful representation both in and outside the ring.Enter wrestlers like Bianca Belair, Mercedes Mone, Carmelo Hayes, Trick Williams, Shane “Swerve” Strickland, The New Day, Naomi, Jade Cargill, Oba Femi, Ricochet, Willow Nightingale, just to name a few. These individuals didn’t just break the mold; they shattered it. As previously stated, Kingston’s victory at WrestleMania 35 — becoming the second-ever Black WWE Champion — became a major inflection point that pointed out that change was coming throughout the entire industry. From there on, the talent kept rolling. Bobby Lashley and Big E followed in Kofi Kingston’s footsteps and became WWE Champions. Years later, Swerve Strickland would make history by becoming All Elite Wrestling’s first-ever black AEW Champion. Mercedes Mone (FKA Sasha Banks) became one of the pillars of the industry’s Women’s Revolution, becoming a six-time World Champion in WWE and is currently reaping the benefits as AEW’s TBS Champion.Bianca Belair is arguably the most successful Black wrestler of this era — man or woman. Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, she was a standout track athlete before transitioning to wrestling. From the moment she stepped into WWE, her presence was undeniable — athletic, charismatic and a natural performer. Her breakout moment came at WrestleMania 37, where she defeated Sasha Banks in a historic main event, becoming SmackDown Women’s Champion. The victory was more than just a title win; it was a cultural milestone — two Black women headlining WWE’s biggest show for the first time ever. She embodies everything the modern Black wrestler represents: authenticity, excellence and the ability to transcend stereotypes. In an era where representation matters more than ever, Belair has become the gold standard for what’s possible in wrestling today.This era of authenticity in wrestling has brought back both lapsed and new Black wrestling fans for its powerful representation. It’s also allowed a stronger marriage of wrestling and hip-hop culture. Wrestling and hip-hop have always shared DNA — bravado, storytelling, spectacle. But over the last decade, that connection has become undeniable. Rappers aren’t just fans anymore; they’re part of the industry. Wale turned WaleMania into a staple of WrestleMania weekend, a celebration of Black wrestlers and hip-hop culture under one roof. Westside Gunn made wrestling references a signature of his music, launched 4th Rope as a hub for wrestling, art and culture, even with live wrestling events.The marriage also inspires the community. Look atThe Wrestling Club, founded by teacher and wrestling fan Victor Perry, where young Black students come together to celebrate wrestling in a space that embraces their passion. The club has gone viral for notable moments meeting Mercedes Mone, Big E, Titus O'Neil, Cedric Alexander, Swerve Strickland, Keith Lee, Willow Nightingale, Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen among others, who see themselves in the community they’ve helped revive.Wrestling didn’t change on its own — fans forced the issue. The industry had no choice but to evolve as culture moved past the tired stereotypes that once defined Black wrestlers. Hip-hop embraced wrestling, wrestlers embraced hip-hop, and together they built a movement. Now, Black champions aren’t anomalies; they’re standard-bearers. The New Day, Bianca Belair, Swerve Strickland — these aren’t just success stories. They’re proof that the old playbook doesn’t work anymore. The next generation, kids inThe Wrestling Cluband beyond, won’t have to squint to see themselves in wrestling’s biggest moments. They’ll just watch — and know they belong.\nKofi Kingston is a character who can summarize the shift in direction for Black wrestlers over the last decade.

She embodies everything the modern Black wrestler represents: authenticity, excellence and the ability to transcend stereotypes. In an era where representation matters more than ever, Belair has become the gold standard for what’s possible in wrestling today.\nThis era of authenticity in wrestling has brought back both lapsed and new Black wrestling fans for its powerful representation. It’s also allowed a stronger marriage of wrestling and hip-hop culture. Wrestling and hip-hop have always shared DNA — bravado, storytelling, spectacle. But over the last decade, that connection has become undeniable. Rappers aren’t just fans anymore; they’re part of the industry. Wale turned WaleMania into a staple of WrestleMania weekend, a celebration of Black wrestlers and hip-hop culture under one roof. Westside Gunn made wrestling references a signature of his music, launched 4th Rope as a hub for wrestling, art and culture, even with live wrestling events.\n\nThe marriage also inspires the community. Look atThe Wrestling Club, founded by teacher and wrestling fan Victor Perry, where young Black students come together to celebrate wrestling in a space that embraces their passion. The club has gone viral for notable moments meeting Mercedes Mone, Big E, Titus O'Neil, Cedric Alexander, Swerve Strickland, Keith Lee, Willow Nightingale, Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen among others, who see themselves in the community they’ve helped revive.\nWrestling didn’t change on its own — fans forced the issue. The industry had no choice but to evolve as culture moved past the tired stereotypes that once defined Black wrestlers. Hip-hop embraced wrestling, wrestlers embraced hip-hop, and together they built a movement. Now, Black champions aren’t anomalies; they’re standard-bearers. The New Day, Bianca Belair, Swerve Strickland — these aren’t just success stories. They’re proof that the old playbook doesn’t work anymore. The next generation, kids inThe Wrestling Cluband beyond, won’t have to squint to see themselves in wrestling’s biggest moments. They’ll just watch — and know they belong.",

        "description": "As a doula, I know that a big part of maternity care is postpartum care. The birth may be over, but the vulnerability doesn’t end there. According toYale Medicine, “cardiomyopathy (a weakened heart muscle) is the most common cause of death one week to a year after delivery,” which highlights how vulnerable new mothers and birthing people are long after the baby arrives.\nToo often, new mothers are expected to bounce back and suffer in silence. But healing from childbirth, adapting to the hormonal shifts of the fourth trimester, and managing the tasks of daily life takes a lot of support. We can’t leave parents alone in the name of privacy or pride. We need to normalize checking in, making care packages, and asking real questions.Here are 10 ways to support new mothers after delivery:Donate to a mutual aid fund. That cash might cover rent, postpartum care, or whatever’s urgent — without asking someone already drained to explain.Send groceries. Ask what they need. Drop off healing, easy-to-prep foods or send a gift card.Give to a diaper fund. Newborns go through 10+ diapers a day. It adds up — fast.Handle chores. Show up to clean only — no small talk, no expectations, just help.Pitch in for a shared personal chef or offer to cook freezeable meals or organize a meal train.Hold the baby — but ask first. Respect rituals like skin-to-skin time, and ask about preferences like remaining fragrance-free.Source secondhand gear. Check your localBuy Nothinggroup for gently used baby items.Offer gift cards for ride shares. Doctor visits shouldn’t ever cause hardship.Be a listener. Simply ask how the birth went and make space to listen. Offer to write it down if they want help capturing the memory while it’s fresh.Check in again — and again. And don’t take silence or delayed response time personally.This is how we lighten the load.

        "title": "WWE Hall of Fame Inductee James \"Kamala\" Harris Shows How Black Wrestlers Overcame Racist Gimmicks",
        "description": "Editor's Note: This post was originally published in August 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.\nThe story of Black professional wrestlers throughout the 19th and 20thcenturies is a familiar one. Talented Black athletes had to overcome racial barriers and discriminatory practices. However, it can be argued that pro wrestling was — and still is, to an extent — rife with more egregious cases of racial exploitation and discrimination through stereotypical gimmicks, unequal pay and advancement opportunities, and, in some instances, sexual exploitation. The late, great James Harris, who wrestled as “The Ugandan Giant” Kamala for almost 30 years, was a pioneering example of how Black athletes found success and career longevity in spite of portraying racist stereotypes that were forced upon them.\nOnly recently, years after his death, has Harris been recognized for the heights that his wrestling career could have taken him. It was announced on April 9 that he would beinducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, alongside other late wrestlers Dory Funk Sr. and Ivan Koloff.\nMississippi native James \"Kamala\" Harris, the Mississippi native, died on Sunday, Aug. 9, 2020, after suffering from a cardiac arrest from complications caused byCOVID-19. Harris, who was 70, also suffered from a long battle with diabetes and high blood pressure since 1992 and had his left leg amputated in 2011. He is survived by his wife, Melissa Guzman.Harris’s story is similar to a lot of Black wrestlers of his era such asThunderbolt Patterson, the first Black World Heavyweight Champion,Ron Simmons, andthe late Sylvester Ritter, also known as The Junkyard Dog. Harris came of age in a poor and working-class environment in Mississippi and became a pro wrestler to earn a significantly substantial living that was not immediately available for Black people in the '60s and the '70s. While some wrestlers were the typical bruising tough guys and charismatic slick talkers akin to their white counterparts, others were givengimmicks based on racial stereotypes.Kofi Kingston, a Black Wrestler from Ghana, began his career cosplaying as a thunder-clapping Jamaican pro wrestler, complete with a fake accent and signature moves like \"Trouble in Paradise\" and the \"Boom Drop.\" Even atDwayne Johnson's debutas The Rock, a man now inseparable from contemporary WWE culture, he was portrayed as a member of the Black militant wrestling team,The Nation of Domination.While these types of gimmicks weren’t exclusive to Black wrestlers — pro wrestling is generally built around parodies and stereotypes of real-world figures — Black wrestlers often had the most overt gimmicks that played into the fears and biases of white fans. Enter Harris's “Kamala” character, a Ugandan headhunter created by wrestling pioneerJerry “The King” Lawler,The Great Mephisto, andJeff Jarrett,inspired by racist stereotypes of African tribes from aFrank Frazetta painting. While Black wrestlers who portrayed these types of gimmicks often didn’t have a choice, as these types of characters were proven to be the most lucrative, they did, as the old saying in wrestling goes, “turn chicken shit into chicken salad.”Behind such a foul gimmick, that was not viewed as critically as it is today, was one of the most talented Black wrestlers of his day. Harris was fearsome at 6’7, 380 pounds, but he was more agile and athletic than many of his white counterparts. He worked with the lateAndre the Giantand Hulk Hogan at the height of their careers. And despite him not being able to speak English in publicto preserve kayfabe, he exuded charisma and a persona that scared children and adults alike, and he became a top-billing, main event player. However, because Black wrestlers, even in WWE, weren’t always considered as “championship material,” he was never able to maximize his career to become the true superstar he could have been. After a fateful meeting with WWE, then WWF CEO Vince McMahon, over his low pay in 1984, he left the company and performed independently across the world, including on-and-off stints with WWE.“I wish things had worked out better for me. I believe the reason why I got done is because I’m a poor boy from down south Mississippi,\" Harris said in a 2015 Bleacher Report mini-doc. \"If I had been a better talker, knew how to negotiate, that probably would have helped me.\"Harris would never earn any championship belts from the promotion. Despite being such a lucrative and memorable character, he missed out on receiving his due flowers while he was alive. Only his family would get the honor of seeing him inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. And it should serve as a black eye among many others to the industry because, as terribly offensive as the Kamala character was, his success paved the way for many other successful wrestlers of color such as the lateEdward “Umaga” Fatu,Martin “The Boogeyman” Wright, and many other legendary giants of color likeMark Henry,Rikishi,Viscera,Charles “The Godfather” Wright,The Great Khali, and many others.—  (@)Harris portraying as a racially insensitive stereotype of Africans is not a mark against a talented athlete who made the best out of what he was given, but rather an indictment of a complicated institution that profited from the fears and bigotry of the most racist of Americans. It was true with characters like The Junkyard Dog and the infamousNew Jack, and while significantly more nuanced, it is still true with the first iteration of WWE’s longest-running and successful stable,The New Day.The life and career of James “Kamala” Harris deserves to be remembered as a testament to how Black wrestlers and wrestlers of color had to overcome the most racist of gimmicks. Even though he was designed to fail, he still became one of the most well-known professional wrestlers of his time. And despite years of suffering from health issues and the shameful treatment from the wrestling business, Harris never wanted pity.“I don’t want people to feel sorry for me because I’m still Kamala and I’ll always be Kamala.”__Mark P.

        "title": "We Are The DJ: Yeldā Ali’s Homegrown Movement",
        "description": "When artist and activist Yeldā Ali became a new mom, she was faced with a choice that far too many women in the U.S. confront every year: return to work before her body and spirit were ready, or figure it out alone. With no universal paid maternity leave — a reality that pushes nearlyone in four women back to workwithin two weeks of giving birth — Ali did what she’s always done: she leaned into community.\nBut this time, the community came to her.\nSo she built something new.From her Brooklyn apartment, Ali launched We Are The DJ, a foundational course for women that’s part technical deep dive, part healing circle. In a few months, she taught over 30 students, mostly women of color, many first-generation and all showing up for more than just the music.“We live in a world where women are taught to shrink themselves. But when you’re DJ’ing, you have to be perceived,” she said. “You’re in the booth. People are looking at you. You’re controlling the energy in the room.” And that control — of tempo, emotion, space — is not just powerful; it’s political. “Women have cried in class. Things come up when you become embodied. DJ’ing forces you into your body,” she adds. “You feel the beat, use your hands, move in rhythm. You can’t be passive.”For Ali, creating this safe space has also been healing. “Wellness is also having money,” she said plainly. Teaching from home allowed her to support herself while staying close to her daughter.Ali never set out to be a full-time DJ. But the deeper she leaned into it, the more she realized music was her method of resistance, connection, and wellness. “I used to feel like, ‘I’m not doing enough,’” she said of those early postpartum months. “But now I see I’m giving these women the tools to go out and represent themselves through art. And that is activism.”In a culture that often defines wellness in narrow, commercialized ways, Ali’s story is a reminder that healing can happen anywhere — in a home studio, between strangers-turned-sisters, or on a dance floor where the lights are low and the bass is heavy. For some, wellness isn’t a yoga mat or a meditation app. It’s a crossfade between grief and joy. It’s learning how to drop a beat — and take up space.\nSo she built something new.\nFrom her Brooklyn apartment, Ali launched We Are The DJ, a foundational course for women that’s part technical deep dive, part healing circle.

        "title": "OkayplayerGO First Impressions: 'South of Midnight'",
        "description": "When I first sawSouth of Midnight, I couldn’t help but think back to my warm memories of my first viewing of Disney’sJames and the Giant Peach. The game’s stop-motion animation evoked those overwhelming feelings of nostalgia as the sight of a young woman riding atop a talking catfish instantly captured my imagination. Now that Compulsion Games’ New Orleans folklore-inspired adventure is finally out, I made sure to hop in and give it a whirl to see if all the positives and negatives dished toward it from pre-release reviews were warranted. After finishing three of the game’s initial chapters, I came away with overwhelmingly positive impressions ofSouth of Midnight.\nComing across such a monumentally sad moment… hit so much harder with the added effect of a well-orchestrated anthem to accompany it.The game’s music is just as impressive. As I jogged through “The Quarters” and an abandoned Cajun community, my ears were treated to tunes that transported me to Louisiana - a memorable batch of songs that stay primarily in the realm of blues and are of the highest quality. And what also makes this game’s soundtrack shine is how it stays in line with whatever sequence is played onscreen. During one particularly somber moment, I climbed up a mangled tree and listened to the sad tale of a brother left to die after his sibling trapped him inside it. The song that played out was especially heartwrenching as it summarized the events that led to that act of betrayal and how it ended with the deceased brother becoming spiritually connected to the tree itself. Coming across such a monumentally sad moment, such as that one, hit so much harder with the added effect of a well-orchestrated anthem to accompany it.South of Midnight’smusic is a treat to my ears and does a fine job of matching the focal locale & mythical elements that define Hazel’s supernatural trek.I didn’t foreseeSouth of Midnightdealing with such serious themes of deception, death, and slavery. But I’m glad it did because those initial plot points have me excited for the remainder of the game’s chapters.From a storyline standpoint,South of Midnightis a lot heavier than I expected. The opening moments allude to Hazel’s predicament being sadder than most as she’s forced to watch her mother get whisked away while trapped in their home as a devastating flood ravages her hometown. Once Hazel discovers her connection to the spiritual realm, she comes into contact with the “Grand Tapestry,” the fabric of the universe that is invisible to most folks. But Hazel can see the “Strands” and memories of the past that are connected to that realm since she’s been bestowed with the powers of a “Weaver,” a magic-wielding individual who can come into contact with the physical embodiment of trauma and witness the heroic deeds of past Weavers. While trying to find her mother, Hazel must deal with the unhealed emotional stress that has overtaken the land and discover its root cause. The aforementioned narrative of a brother being trapped within a tree by his kin and the tale of a previous Weaver who used her powers to help slaves find their way to freedom caught me off guard — I didn’t foreseeSouth of Midnightdealing with such serious themes of deception, death, and slavery. But I’m glad it did because those initial plot points have me excited for the remainder of the game’s chapters.Gameplay-wise,South of Midnightprovides an enjoyable mix of combat and platforming sections. Double jumping into a gliding motion to reach far-off locales, wall running to safety while a vengeful spirit follows close behind, and smacking Haint villains around with melee attacks and magical powers come together to offer fun bits of exploration and action. While the gameplay itself may not be complex and all that different from your average third-person action-adventure experience, it’s solid enough and provides a nice change of pace from time to time. I’ve unlocked new attacks and upgrades for my spectral abilities that give Hazel new tools to work with, so I’m looking forward to using them against the new types of Haint monsters that are sure to come my way as the game marches on.VERDICT:All in all,South of Midnighthas impressed me immensely during its opening hours. Its art style is marvelous, its music is majestic, and its plot managed to grab me in ways I couldn’t have imagined. I’m very much looking forward to wiping out all those damned Haints and getting to the bottom of Hazel’s connection to the otherworldly beings that inhabit her homeland within the deep south. If you haven’t already, giveSouth of Midnighta chance and treat yourself to one of the most impressive Xbox Game Studios’ releases of 2025.

        "title": "The 13 Female Rappers Who Dominated '90s Hip-Hop Fashion",
        "description": "Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2023 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.\nDuring the‘90s, female rapperscontinued to build upon existing trends that trickled in from‘80s hip-hop fashiondue in part to legendary acts likeSalt-N-PepaandRoxanne Shanté, who laid the foundation for the female rap aesthetic.Da Brat,Left Eye, andQueen Latifahdrew upon masculine elements that were prevalent in the male-dominated genre, with looks consisting of ultra baggy denim, athleticwear, and boots, all while adding their own unique flair.\nOn the other hand, rappers likeLil Kim,Foxy Brown, andGangsta Boodared to push the boundaries of how women should dress, opting for sexy form-fitting silhouettes and exposed undergarments that mirrored their sex-forward lyrics.\nWhile some artists fell exclusively on either end of the spectrum, there’s no denying how they influenced women’s ‘90s hip-hop fashion, which left a notable mark on‘90s fashionin general. In honor of those artists and their contributions, here are the 13 female rappers from the ‘90s whose fashion impact is eternally ingrained in hip-hop.\nAmilIn 1997, Amil, then a member of the all-female group Major Coins, met JAY-Z, who was looking for a woman to contribute vocals to his third album,Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life. After an impressive freestyle, she was selected for the part and eventually became JAY’s protégée following the group's break up. She featured on various songs including “Can I Get A” and “Jigga What, Jigga Who,” often sporting elevated minimalistic looks in the music videos for these songs. Leather bras and pants, cropped furs, one-shoulder tops, thick blinged-out chokers — Amil had a distinct style that paired well with her equally distinct voice, helping her stand out during her peak in the late ‘90s andearly 2000s.Da BratDa Brat’s emergence with her 1994 debut album,Funkdafied, hallmarked her as the first female rapper to go platinum, and solidified her as a ‘90s fashion icon. Her fluid style encompassed the silhouettes that helped define the ‘90s hip-hop era: oversized tees, baggy-fit denim, flannels, and leather coats mixed with crop tops and fitted tanks. While other female rappers' looks often included masculine elements, Da Brat’s aesthetic appeared rooted in authenticity and effortlessness rather than an exploration of the trends. In addition to her androgynous style, Da Brat’s hair and use of accessories also became a highlight, the artist often wearing jumbo twists with an assortment of colorful rubber bands, yarn, and beads presenting as wearable hair art.Foxy BrownFoxy Brown always knew she was the illest, and she rightfully claimed her place on fashion mood boards by marrying sexy street style and high fashion. In 1996, she released her debut albumIll Na Na,where she wore a spaghetti-strapped black dress, pencil-thin eyebrows, dark lipstick, and a gold pendant chain against an electric blue backdrop, a look that would stick throughout her career (most notably in the music video for her and JAY-Z’s hit song “I’ll Be,” where she was styled by legendary stylistJune Ambrose). While many female rappers adopted the streetwear style, Foxy’s style closely aligned with her sex-riddled and luxurious bars. She was laced in Gucci mini dresses, two-toned furs, sheer tops that exposed her printed bras, low-rise skirts, and gaudy designer belts, which made her the perfect muse for designers like John Galiano and Calvin Klein.Gangsta BooThe late Gangsta Booundeniably helped lay the foundation for Southern women in hip-hop, joining the legendary Three 6 Mafia in 1995 after being featured on the title track for the group’s debut album,Mystic Stylez. Through the group, as well as her solo work, Boo became known for her razor sharp and lusty wordplay. That, paired with her Southern hood opulence, cemented her impact. On the cover of her debut albumEnquiring Minds, the Queen of Memphis donned a royal-esque red leather coat trimmed with black fur over black undergarments. The music video for her hit single “Where Dem Dollas” also showcased her standout sense of fashion, with the rapper wearing latex dresses, bold colored furs, flowy sheer tops, high slits, leather halter sets, an iced out choker, and her signature auburn-hued hair. There’s no denying Gangsta Boo’s significance as an artist, but it’s also about time that she gets acknowledged for her style, too.Lady of RageIn 1994, Lady of Rage came in kickin’ up dust with a perfectly centered crisp part, and two coily puffs perched on each side of her head in the video for herAbove The Rimhit song “Afro Puffs.” At a time when bone straight hair, braids, pixie cuts, and spritzed updos were popular, her opt for the style made a statement and signified the track as an anthem for Black women and their natural tresses. Frequently cloaked in black ensembles — leather trench coats, biker vests, mesh tops — and metallic chokers and chunky bracelets, her look was a hip-hop hybrid of the Black Panthers andthe ‘70s disco era, all while aligning with the eerie aesthetic of her Death Row labelmates. Upon her transition into acting, her famed afro puffs would reprise their role alongside her rough and tough persona in movies likeRideandNext Friday, as well as a recurring role onThe Steve Harvey Show.Lauryn HillAt the apex of her career with the Fugees, Lauryn Hill released her critically acclaimed (and only) solo album,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Now removed from her male group members, she was positioned as the next revolutionary artist fusing hip-hop and neo soul in a way that felt like spiritually guided hymns. In her days with the Fugees, she adopted elements of the mainstream hip-hop aesthetic, but herMiseducationera birthed her eclectic style rooted in femininity, as depicted on her famousHoneymagazine cover. Her penchant for maxi skirts, knitted hats, and free-flowing layers was paired with denim, bold prints, and patterns. As she became more reclusive and adverse to fame, she began to refine her style, opting for headwraps and more modest garments.Left EyeThe late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes was truly ahead of her time, leaving an undeniable mark on fashion and pop culture. As a member oflegendary R&B group TLC, she frequently wore coordinating outfits with fellow members T-Boz and Chilli. But her individualism shined through as she captivated audiences with her uniquely animated flow and eccentric style. Left Eye’s looks incorporated unconventional and playful elements: a black stripe under her left eye, exposed boxers, condom-framed glasses, and larger-than-life hats. At the time of her untimely passing in 2002, Left Eye had already helped lay the foundation for the Y2K aesthetic to come, with mesh layering tops, graphic baby tees, asymmetrical tube tops, and shimmering pants. Her style also heavily leaned into Afrofuturism, with leather jumpsuits, vinyl spacesuits, knotted ponytails, and braids connected to circular hair hoops.Lil KimLil Kim is arguablyone of the most influential female rapperswhen it comes to fashion and pop culture. Storming hip-hop in 1994 as a member of Junior Mafia, Lil Kim came through with cutthroat, in-your-face bars, and certified herself as a force to be reckoned with. In 1996, she released her debut albumHardcore, putting her sexual innuendos and love of designer labels and jewels at the forefront of her lethal lyrics. In music videos for her hit tracks “No Time” and “Crush On You,” she famously wore a barrage of luxurious and monochromatic looks. Lil Kim’s fashion legacy would be solidified by her daring style consisting of luxury logo-stamped wigs, layered gold Chanel belts, floor-length furs, and seashell nipple covers. Throughout the ‘90s (and the rest of her career), she seamlessly fused hip-hop and high fashion, bridging the gap between the streets and luxury, and ultimately becoming the muse of designers like Donatella Versace and Marc Jacobs.Mia XIn 1995, Mia X signed with Master P’s No Limit Records, making her the first female rapper to be signed to the label. Her debut albumGood Girl Gone Badand sophomore albumUnlady Like, were a fusion of her no-holds-barred lyrics and New Orleans bounce music. Mia X’s style paralleled her music, exuding Southern sadity and pageant-esque glam. As a No Limit Soldier, Mia coordinated her camouflage looks with a feminine twist consisting of floor length furs, sequined camo, and sheer sets with matching bras. When she wasn’t laced in camo she donned leather suits, monochromatic sets, lace tops, and oversized jerseys, her style only adding to her impact as a groundbreaking Southern female rapper.MC LyteA pioneer of hip-hop with easily one of the most notable styles of the ‘90s, MC Lyte impeccably blended trends from both ‘80s and ‘90s hip-hop fashion eras. Her fluid and bold style was the perfect juxtaposition to songs like “Poor George'' and “Ruffneck,” where she detailed her romantic attractions and desires. Leaning into more masculine considered silhouettes, her style featured tracksuits, varsity jackets, oversized tees, baseball hats, gold door knocker earrings, and bright red lipstick. Her hair was also a notable part of her style, too. Always perfectly in place, her hair saw a transition from the golden, voluminous curled mullet that defined her look in the ‘80s, to a dark, sleek bumped bob that paired well with her vibrant and cool aesthetic during the ‘90s.Monie LoveMonie Love is deeply revered for her impact as a British female rapper. After moving from London to the states in 1989, she subsequently released her debut albumDown To Earthin 1990. With tracks like “Monie in the Middle” and “It’s A Shame (My Sister),” it was apparent that Monie had effortlessly assimilated into hip-hop with her smooth flow and vibrant style. Comparable to the style ofher Native Tongues male counterparts, Monie Love delved into streetwear rocking colorful windbreakers, hats cocked to the side, denim pairings, and chunky, abstract earrings, in addition to her short, finger-combed haircut.Queen LatifahQueen Latifah reigned as queen, setting herself apart from her peers not just with her powerful delivery, but her afrocentric-inspired style. On her sophomore albumNature of a Sistaand follow-up albumBlack Reign, Latifah packaged Afrocentrism and feminism into dynamic ladies’ anthems like “U.N.I.T.Y” and “Fly Girl.” Akin to her lyrical content, she found power in fashion, being clothed in a wealth of African garb and textiles including crowns, dashikis, weaved hats, and pendants. Latifah’s style centered Black empowerment and women’s liberation while defying the sexualization of Black women. She furthered her fashion imprint on the big and small screen too throughout the ‘90s, portraying everyone fromFlavormagazine editor and publisher Khadijah James to the socially-conscious Zora inHouse Party 2.Yo-YoYo-Yo came out the gate with a buttery flow and an effortlessly cool style to match. Dubbed the “brand new intelligent Black lady” byher mentor Ice Cubeon her 1991 single “You Can’t Play With My Yo-Yo,” she attacked an uptempo beat with a clear stance on respect and boundaries. In the video, she donned sheer blouses, quilted jackets, an American flag set, and peace sign earrings. Like many female rappers in the ‘90s, her look incorporated floral vests, striped pants, color block shirts, and athletic windbreakers. However, her most recognizable style attribute was her blonde micro braids, often styled in a high side ponytail with a tightly curled bang, or peeking from under a boldly colored Kangol hat.\nIn 1997, Amil, then a member of the all-female group Major Coins, met JAY-Z, who was looking for a woman to contribute vocals to his third album,Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life. After an impressive freestyle, she was selected for the part and eventually became JAY’s protégée following the group's break up.

        "title": "Comedian Clint Coley on His Bipolar Diagnosis and Why He’s Not Quiet About It",
        "description": "Breaking generational curses doesn’t always look like therapy couches and wellness retreats. Sometimes, it looks like a Black man standing on stage telling jokes — and the truth. ForClint Coley, healing meant facing a diagnosis he didn’t want, committing to treatment that he once avoided, and learning that strength can look like asking for help. He’s even worked his bipolar diagnosis into his stand-up sets, using humor to open up conversations that rarely happen in public, especially among Black men.\nFollowing a crisis that led to hospitalization, Coley began to see how serious things had become. “It takes a while to wrap your head around the fact that you gotta take meds every single day. You have to do it. Like, ain't no you skipped your meds like four or five days.”Coley’s honesty is rare — and needed. According toMental Health America, while Black Americans experience bipolar disorder at the same rate as other groups, they are far less likely to be diagnosed or treated. Socioeconomic barriers,cultural stigma, and mistrust in medical institutions all play a role. “Our parents would just be like, ain't nothing wrong with you. Go sit down and shut up.”Now a new father to a baby girl, Coley says parenthood has given him a different outlook. After years of struggling with suicidal ideation, becoming a dad reframed what was at stake. \"I don't ever want my daughter to feel like her daddy gave up,\" he shared in our conversation.For Coley, wellness means having space to show up authentically. Playing live video games with friends has offered a space for radical honesty. \"My boy yesterday, he got on, I'm like, man, how you feel bro? He like, I'm gonna be real, I'm not alright. Alright bro, let's go shoot some [people in the game] and tell us why you not.\"He doesn’t want to be anyone’s poster boy, but he’s also not hiding. “You gotta assemble the fucking Avengers. That's the only way to deal with it. It is me, my therapist, my friends who consistently make space for me, family, again, medicine — like all those things.”Coley has no vision of becoming a wellness guru or a mental health poster child. But staying honest and unafraid to name what he's lived through might just give someone else permission to do the same.\nFollowing a crisis that led to hospitalization, Coley began to see how serious things had become. “It takes a while to wrap your head around the fact that you gotta take meds every single day.

        "title": "Flying Lotus’ Sci-Fi Horror Flick, ‘Ash,’ is Out Now",
        "description": "Flying Lotus’s latest film adventure is officially out. The acclaimed producer has just released his first major studio film, the sci-fi horror flickAsh, building on his cinematic repertoire after the 2017 experimental body horror filmKuso. The movie stars Eiza González (Godzilla Vs Kong) and Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad)\n“It was one of those things where I couldn’t put the script down,” FlyLorecently toldVariety. “The typical criteria that gets a director going is you want to know what’s going to happen next. You start coming up with images and visuals in your head. But I think more than anything I saw an opportunity to experiment and try things. The script was written in a way that was like a puzzle, but at the same time it felt like more of a blueprint than a Bible. It allowed me space, and credit to the writer, Jonni Remmler, who wasn’t super precious about his contributions and would be willing to change stuff and reimagine the scene. We hammered out ideas for over a year before we even got into production.”\nInAsh, Gonzalez stars as an astronaut on a remote planet who suddenly wakes up to discover that her crew has been slaughtered and has no memory of what happened outside of random, disconnected flashbacks. When another astronaut (Paul) shows up to help her after receiving a distress call, she has to determine whether or not she can trust him. The project has been in the works for some time, withTessa Thompsononce attached to an earlier iteration of the film. But FlyLo says he knew González was his lead.“She had to bring a lot of personality to this role,” explained FlyLo. “And she had to just be on and be fierce and caring, carrying this movie. I saw her work, I saw what she was capable of. When we started talking, she was talking to me aboutSilent Hilland video games right out of the gate. I said, ‘Yep, that’s exactly what I’m thinking. We’re seeing the same thing. I think we need to do this.’”Flying Lotus also composedthe score forAsh, and both the film and soundtrack were released March 21.\nInAsh, Gonzalez stars as an astronaut on a remote planet who suddenly wakes up to discover that her crew has been slaughtered and has no memory of what happened outside of random, disconnected flashbacks.

        "title": "In Her Words: Tashera Simmons is Finally Finding Herself",
        "description": "For years,Tashera Simmonslived in the shadows of one of hip-hop’s most iconic yet tormented figures. As the ex-wife of the lateDMX,she was there through the highs of multi-platinum success and the lows of addiction,incarcerationand infidelity. But Tashera is more than just the woman behind a legend. She’s a survivor, a mother, and now, an author sharing her own truth. In her new book,Dying To Self, she details the painful but transformative journey of reclaiming her identity after years of emotional turmoil. In this Women’s History Month edition of Okayplayer’sIn Her Words, Tashera opens up about her healing process, therapy, and learning to stand on her own.\nOn Therapy and Breaking CyclesTashera Simmons:The book was really based on just me getting a lot of therapy. Like 8 years of therapy and ripping down the layers and the band-aids of my childhood past. And you really don’t realize when you’re a grown adult and then you go through other traumas, how much of what we react to comes from childhood. It kind of messed me up, to be totally honest with you. And I guess I came to a point where I just couldn’t do it anymore mentally.Me and X did a show calledCouples Therapy, and I didn’t even want to do it, but he was like, ‘Yo, you’re gonna make this amount of money and you should do it.’ And it was groundbreaking for me. It was what made me ask for a divorce. Up until then, I don’t think I would have gotten a divorce at all, no matter what he did.Me and X did [sessions with life coach and therapist] Iyanla Vanzant with our son and they gave usfree therapy.Six sessions with a therapist and she was amazing. And that's my therapist to this day. She was so good. I took a little gap afterCouples Therapyand then after a few years I was like man, I need therapy — like that really helped me navigate life. I tracked her down and we've been in therapy ever since. As soon as I sat on her couch, she said, ‘Let's start from the beginning.’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ She said, ‘Your childhood.’ I literally just broke down and cried…It’s crazy how we can really walk around here as people just broken and don’t even realize it. And when I look back now, after like 8 years of therapy and really diving in with God, I was like, ‘Damn, I was so lost and broken.’On Writing 'Dying To Self'So that's what the book stems from. And I'm just vulnerable in the book. I named the chapters off of different incidents that I went through, but just giving a positive outlook on it all. Basically, trying to guide people. Life is hard. We're gonna go through a bunch of different things. But if we do it with God, it's just totally different. And I reference scriptures. I talk about being celibate for 10 years. And being a sex addict. I talk about that in my celibacy chapter. That's all I thought about. That was my comfort. I don't drink or smoke. I always say, X did that enough for both of us. So I never went that way. He had a high sex drive. I had a high sex drive. I didn't really know any different because he was the only person I was with. But then after we broke up that's all I was looking for in relationships. I did not even care. And I wasn't even out there like that.I'm moving towards the light even though it hurts like it's blinding. And I have to be vulnerable in it and I have to talk about uncomfortable things.Somebody said to me, ‘What you put up there in that book, you got to think about it, you know?’ And I said, “It's all the truth. I made sure that I didn't dog Earl out, because I never want to do that. Please don't judge him because he's just a person like me. He's just a broken person, made messed up choices like we all do. It’s just really about these temporary souls that's passing through. And I'm trying to be vulnerable, to help someone else because we ain't gonna be here forever. And I just feel like God's called me to do that.When I tell you, it is so consuming. His legacy, it’s almost like — like I say to my kids all the time, I’m like, ‘Damn, this is why your father was done with life.’ Because this is a lot. He was carrying a lot.On Motherhood and Healing Generational TraumaI realized I never set any boundaries. It was just. And I'm like, where did that come from? And then I had to dig back into my past and I was just like, ‘Oh, yes. I never had any structure.’ I was already broken. My mom left me when I was a little girl, [at] 14. I don't know. I'm just doing life. I just fell in love and making up my own rules and not even having anything to really stand on. And no blueprint from women for me. It was just like, ‘I need to get some therapy.’I broke a generational curse because I was abandoned. My mom was abandoned, my father was abandoned, Earl was abandoned. And I felt like Earl abandoned us. He walked out. ‘You don’t want to deal with my shit? Then I’m gone.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, go. Bye.’ Because I’m not dealing with this shit. And yeah, I could have walked out on my kids, and I said, ‘No.’ I stopped it. My kids have all gotten therapy at young ages. They’re very healthy in their minds. They don’t cheat on their girlfriends. They’ve seen how it tears families apart.On Faith and Moving ForwardEverything happens for a reason. I talk about that in my book because I'm really trying to have people get a perspective of even the ugliest things in life could turn into your biggest blessing.But it’s like we gotta die to ourselves to see that. And that’s why I call itDying to Self.Because trust me, I’ve been on the floor many nights crying because I just don’t know what to do. But then after the fact, I’m like, ‘Wait a minute. This is like a rebirth.’ I’m shedding all these tears and it’s hurt and it’s pain, but it’s like, ‘God, you have something for me on this other side.’ And I started to see that. But it’s like I had to die to myself. Like literally.\nTashera Simmons:The book was really based on just me getting a lot of therapy.

        "title": "Valerie June is Cultivating Joy, One Breath at a Time",
        "description": "Valerie June has always defied categories. A self-taught multi-instrumentalist with roots in gospel, blues, and Appalachian folk, she calls her sound \"organic moonshine roots music.\" But these days, she’s not just shaping songs—she’s shaping space for stillness.\nSplitting her time between Brooklyn and Tennessee, June lives a life on the move, performing more than 150 shows a year. “In order to do that, I have to really heavily lean on my meditation practice and mywellness practice,” she says. “I basically use the day as like these little 10-minute pockets of grounding myself. No matter where I'm at, I'll go for a 10-minute walk or 10-minute jog. And then I'll say, okay, I'm just gonna dance for 10 minutes... do yoga for 10 minutes... do a 10-minute breathwork meditation, and just weave that into the day.”\nFor June, mindfulness isn’t just about sitting still — it’s about presence. “I bring mindfulness into washing dishes,” she says. “I'm grateful for the water... the soap... I'm in this practice of washing these dishes. And as I'm doing that, sometimes a song will come.” One of her most well-known songs, \"Astral Plane\" from her 2017 albumThe Order of Time,came to her mid-stir while cooking carrots and onions. “I heard the voice that said, ‘Is there a light that you have inside you can't touch?’”Joy, for June, is not light and fluffy — it’s radical. “Joy is so deep in there that you can be sad and still hold on to it,” she says. “I come to joy from the lynchings, from the rapes, from the skinnings, the burnings. I come to joy because I know that my people invented the blues... Joy is fierce. It's powerful.”Photo by Travys-Owen.Her wellness work now includes teaching at retreats like Omega Institute and The Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health, where she learned the power of small, intimate circles. “You don’t have to be big to be impactful. Small communities all over the planet are these places where we can practice joy together.”Whether she’s writing songs, poems, or simplybreathing through the chaos, June is clear on one thing: the work is never done. “Trusting the path is a practice. You don’t arrive at it — you dive into it, again and again.”She’s also continuing to share her light through music, with a new album,Owls, Omens and Oracles, arriving April 11.When overwhelm hits — as it inevitably does — Valerie returns to what she calls her \"three breaths\" practice. “You pause sharp right there as soon as you feel like you're about to snap,” she says. “You take in that first breath... pause again, and you hold it right there. I call that home, because between every breath — home, home all day long.” Breathing in, breathing out, she repeats: \"I am home.\"\nFor June, mindfulness isn’t just about sitting still — it’s about presence. “I bring mindfulness into washing dishes,” she says. “I'm grateful for the water... the soap...

        "title": "Chelsea VonChaz: The Period Doula Changing the Conversation Around Menstrual Health",
        "description": "ForChelsea VonChaz, periods are more than just a monthly inconvenience — they’re a crucial health indicator and a source of empowerment. As a full-spectrum doula who also specializes in menstrual care, she offers emotional, educational and practical support to individuals throughout their entire menstrual cycle. Her work isn’t just about easing discomfort; it’s about changing how people view their bodies.\n“A period doula provides emotional,educationaland practical support during all four phases of the menstrual cycle,” VonChaz explains. “The menstrual phase is the one most people struggle with, but a lot of times, it’s actually our habits — what we eat, how much we rest — that create the struggle. Your period tells you so much aboutyour bodybefore any doctor will.”\nVonChaz is on a mission to shift the narrative around menstruation, advocating for people to see their cycles as a vital sign rather than an afterthought. “Your period is saying a lot more than just ‘you’re not pregnant,’” she says. By paying attention to changes in mood, flow and symptoms, people can gain deeper insights into their overall health.One phase that deserves more attention, she says, is the luteal phase — the days leading up to menstruation that many experience as an emotional and physical rollercoaster. “I like to compare the phases of the cycle to the seasons. Ovulation is summer — we’re out, we have energy. Then the luteal phase is fall — everything is changing. If you don’t adjust, you’re gonna feel out of sync,” she explains.To cope with the luteal phase, VonChaz suggests tracking symptoms through journaling. “It may sound silly, but writing down what’s happening in your body helps you see patterns. Are you more anxious? Are you cramping more than usual? Tracking these things helps you advocate for yourself when talking to doctors.”Beyond physical symptoms, VonChaz also emphasizes the mental health aspect of menstruation. “There’s so much pressure to just push through pain — whether it’s emotional or physical. But your cycle is not something to ignore or apologize for.”By taking ownership of your cycle, Chelsea says, empowerment inevitably follows. Showing up to doctor appointments equipped with your own data matters, especially in a field of medicine that often overlooks Black women's symptoms.As a perioddoula, she helps people navigate medical decisions about their wombs, ensuring they understand their own bodies and their needs are heard.\nVonChaz is on a mission to shift the narrative around menstruation, advocating for people to see their cycles as a vital sign rather than an afterthought. “Your period is saying a lot more than just ‘you’re not pregnant,’” she says.

This is work, this is home. We’re very inclusive with our movement. Once we’re off the road, we’re like, ‘Alright. You got family to deal with, I got shit I gotta do.’ My circle is very small. So we all have different lives. I don’t hang out with rappers.

Of course, Wu is my crew or whatever, but there’s a lot of artists that we might chop it up on the phone – but no,” Redman continued. “The only artists I hang out with is my boy DoItAll from Lords of The Underground and Treach if I see him in the hood and that’s about it. And Kid Capri. Kid Capri is my big bro. I talk to him and go see him all the time. But he’s not a rapper though. He’s a DJ.

Our skin tends to produce more melanin, so when it’s irritated or inflamed, it can leave behind dark spots that take a long time to fade. I also see a lot of clients struggling with uneven skin tone and sensitivity from using products that weren’t designed for our skin. And of course, dryness and dullness — especially during colder months or postpartum, when hormones shift — are also really common. A lot of what I do is help women build routines that strengthen their skin and make them feel confident, even while they're working through these concerns.What are some common mistakes women make with the everyday care of their skin and face?Honestly, I see so many women overcomplicating their skincare. I get it — there are so many products out there, and it’s easy to think we need to use everything to get results. But often, layering too many actives like retinol, acids and vitamin C without guidance leads to irritation, which makes things like hyperpigmentation worse. Another big one is skipping sunscreen — especially in communities of color. I always say, the best glow starts with protecting your skin. And finally, I think a lot of women don’t give themselves grace — skin health is a journey, and we need to be patient with it, not beat ourselves up when it’s not perfect.Can you give us three to five daily natural rituals that women (specifically women of color) can incorporate into their routine for better skin health?Absolutely! I’m a big believer in simple rituals that you can realistically stick to, especially as a mom myself:(1) Gentle cleansing morning and night — Don't strip your skin. Use a nourishing cleanser and avoid hot water.(2) Daily facial massage — Even if it’s just a minute with your hands, it boosts circulation and brings out your natural glow.(3) Layer hydration — A lightweight serum (like hyaluronic acid) followed by a moisturizer helps maintain that plump, healthy look.(4) Never skip sunscreen — I love mineral sunscreens that work well on deeper skin tones — there are great options now that don’t leave a white cast.(5) Take a moment for yourself — Whether it’s breathing deeply, sipping tea, or speaking affirmations in the mirror, stress management is a huge part of skin health.If a client wants to achieve a healthy look with glowing, radiant skin, what are some beauty tips you would give them?Focus onhydrationand consistency. You don’t need a 12-step routine — just products that nourish and protect your skin. A vitamin C serum can brighten and even skin tone, and adding a weekly gentle exfoliation (like an enzyme mask) can smooth and refresh. Also, don’t sleep on moisturizer and SPF — well-moisturized skin reflects light better and gives that natural glow. And I always remind people: drink water, get your sleep and eat well — because glow starts from within.Are there any other dietary recommendations you give your clients for better skin health?Yes! What you eat definitely shows up on your skin. I always recommend foods rich in antioxidants and healthy fats — like berries, leafy greens, avocados, and salmon. Omega-3s are amazing for reducing inflammation and keeping skin supple. I also tell my clients to watch their sugar and processed foods intake, since those can trigger breakouts and dullness. And of course — water, water, water! Staying hydrated is one of the simplest ways to improve your skin.Lastly, can you speak a bit about the unrealistic beauty standards that young women and girls see on social media, TV, and advertisements and how they can be confident in their own skin?This is something I’m really passionate about, especially as a mom of two girls. Social media shows a filtered version of reality — skin without pores, texture, or lines. But real skin has all of those things, and that’s normal and beautiful. I always remind my clients and my daughters that their worth is not in how they look but in who they are. Skin is not meant to be \"perfect.\" It’s meant to protect you, reflect your health, and change with you through life.For women of color, it’s even more important to celebrate our natural beauty — our skin tones, features, and hair textures — because we haven’t always been represented in mainstream beauty.

        "description": "\nA new documentary about legendary soul and funk artistCurtis Mayfield, that’s directed byH.E.R., just had its premiere — and H.E.R. has taken some time to discuss how the project came about.While speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, the multi-talented artist talked about the documentary, titledThe Makings of Curtis Mayfield, which came about after H.E.R. mentioned Mayfield during an award acceptance speech that film producer Peter Afterman was present for. Afterman approached the musician after the speech with the idea of directing the documentary.H.E.R. spoke on how the project differs from most biographical documentaries in that it focuses more on the music than anything else — something she said was “always the most interesting thing to me.”“As I was sitting down with people, the common thing that I recognized the most within the conversations was impact,” she said. “His nickname is ‘a gentle genius,’ and I had no idea what that meant until I was listening to how many people were students of his. His presence is not only about loving that song from ‘72 or watchingSuperfly. No matter how versed you are in who he is, his presence was so felt and his genius was so felt.”“People give the credit to Marvin Gaye, and they give some credit to Stevie [Wonder] and there’s a lot of people who spoke politically to Sly [Stone], but [Mayfield] came before a lot of those people,” she continued.Elsewhere, she talked about some of the people interviewed for the documentary, most notably Dr. Dre.“Dr. Dre was really special to me because we were in his space [filming took place in Dr. Dre’s home studio], and he knew so much about Curtis,” H.E.R. said. “He had these child-like reactions to the music in real time. When people experience Dr. Dre’s love for Curtis in this doc, they get a different Dr. Dre. I think that is so powerful. In that interview, you get to see how he influenced hip-hop.”The artist also spoke with one of Mayfield’s sons, Cheaa, noting that it was “really important to get his perspective.”“He gave us what he could, and he’s later in the doc, because that was what he remembered from when he was a kid,” she said. “I hope that the way that I’m telling [Curtis’] story is the way that he wanted to be told. I think Curtis would have wanted us to focus on the music as much as possible.”“He was actually such a pure soul, really a man of integrity. Talking to his family and thinking about how to stay true to him were important to me,” she added. “I did not want to be like, ‘Where’s the scandal? What’re the things that he did in the dark?’ I wanted to give him the credit that he deserves.”The Makings of Curtis Mayfieldpremiered at this year’s SXSW.According to a synopsisfor the film, it “pays homage to Mayfield by underscoring his direct impact on some of the most renowned artists of our generation.” It’s unknown if the project will have a wider theatrical release or be put on a streaming service at some point later this year.\nA new documentary about legendary soul and funk artistCurtis Mayfield, that’s directed byH.E.R., just had its premiere — and H.E.R. has taken some time to discuss how the project came about.\nWhile speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, the multi-talented artist talked about the documentary, titledThe Makings of Curtis Mayfield, which came about after H.E.R. mentioned Mayfield during an award acceptance speech that film producer Peter Afterman was present for.

I knew I wasn’t going to get him to direct s**t,” Jordan said. “I was just throwing it out there to see if he was going to, but I knew he wasn’t going to do it because he only directs things that he writes. And he was like, ‘Man, I got something for you right now.’ He bypassed [the other project] and pitched me [Sinners].”\nSee on Instagram\nIn an Instagram post, Lee extended praise to theBlack Pantherdirector, saying that he “just had the greatest experience of watching a film in years.”\n“His magnificent artistry as a storyteller is on another level,” Lee said of Coogler, adding later in the post, “I haven’t felt this way in a movie theatre in a minute.”\n“Last thing I told my brother, Ryan, ‘He really, 100, tapped into our ancestors on this joint,” he said.\nTheMalcolm Xdirector also had positive words forSinners’ main star, Michael B. Jordan, saying that he did his “thang, thang.”\nSinnersis scheduled to release this year on April 18. The supernatural horror film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

        "title": "10 Rare Movies That Belong in the Black Film Canon",
        "description": "Every few years, a major publication compiles a list of important films to represent the Black film canon. Sometimes these lists aregood, sometimesthey’re great, and sometimes they seem likethey’ve been written by AI(The Helpas the No. 1 “Best Black Film of All Time” is insane).\nBut even when these lists are on point, they can still be, at least a little, predictable. To be clear, “predictable” doesn’t mean “bad.” There are only so many times you can listDo The Right Thing orBoyz N The Hoodas important Black films. By now, it should be common knowledge that filmmakers like Spike Lee, John Singleton, Julie Dash and Robert Townsend have had an undeniable impact on modern cinema and popular culture, as evidenced by the awards they’ve won and their work becoming reference points for everyone from Beyonce to brands like Nike.\nWe will forever sing the praises ofHollywood Shuffle,Poetic JusticeandSweet Sweetback’s Badass Song,but, as we celebrate Black History Month 2025, we must acknowledge that there’s room for some lesser-known movies and directors to get some shine too.\nTwenty years ago it was difficult to see the films ofIsaac Julien, Charles Lane and Bill Gunn, but thanks to various streaming services, filmarchivists like Maya S. Cade, and repertory theaters all over the world, semi-rare and hard-to-find films are easier than ever to come by — if you know where to look.\nHere are some recommendations to help you start your Black cinema search.\n‘Murder In Harlem’ (1935)We know Tubi has a reputation for questionable original programming that can appear to be cheap and exploitative, but if you dig pastTrap House(2023) andRed Flags(2022), you’ll find hundreds of classic and forgotten filmswaiting to be discovered.Murder In Harlemis one of them. Since we’re adding to and reassessing the canon, what better place to start than the earliest period of Black-directed features?Murder In Harlemis the story of a Black night watchman who is framed for the murder of a white woman — make sure to read up on the real trial ofLeo Frankthat served as the inspiration for the film.The film’s director, Oscar Micheaux, is sometimes credited as the first Black filmmaker with over 40 films under his belt. More than half of his movies have been lost over the years due to neglect and improper preservation techniques, so the ones that have survived are important artifacts for showing post-Slavery/pre-Jim Crow Black life in America.Watch it onYouTubeorTubi.‘Dutchman’ (1967)Contrary to what some critics might say about the post-Get Outera we’re in right now, the taboo of interracial relationships — specifically between Black men and white women — has been explored on film for decades in movies likeJungle FeverandGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner.Dutchman, based on the 1964 Amiri Baraka play, plays out like a minimalist yet more transgressive version ofGet OutbeforeGet Outexisted. Now that films and television shows likeMa, Lovecraft Country, AliceandAntebellumhave found an audience, perhaps it’s time to give this movie a proper reassessment.Watch it onYouTube(while you can).‘The Session’While the Spike Lee-produced dramaThe Drop Squadmay have missed the mark upon its initial release, its predecessor and early short film version;The Session,a lower budget version of Black militant fantasy, is pitch perfect.For those who don’t remember, the “sellout” was a hot topic amongst Black people in the ‘90s. Spike Lee, Ice Cube, Public Enemy and other prominent culture critics always made a point to take jabs at the Black conservative or the self-hating Black person that distanced themselves from others that looked like them, but there hadn’t been anything that focused solely on the subject until the work of director David C. Johnson.The basic premise is still there — a group of Black radicals kidnap “sellouts” in an effort to deprogram and reprogram brainwashed brothers and sisters in a controversial style similar to the techniques shown in Kubrick’sAClockwork Orange. The difference between this version and the final version is thatThe Sessionis presented as a faux documentary with far more dark humor and cynicism than the more dramatic feature film version some of us are familiar with.Fake documentaries likeSpinal Tapwere successful in the early ‘80s but they weren’t as common as they are today (The Office, Abbot Elementary, What We Do In The Shadows, etc). PerhapsThe Sessionwas ahead of its time?LikeDutchman,The Sessionhas been on YouTube for years and hasn’t been taken down. The only difference is that it's broken up into six parts. But if you put the videos into a playlist and use the autoplay feature on YouTube, you can solve that problem.Watch it onYouTube.‘Bless Their Little Hearts’TheLA Rebellionwas an unofficial film movement spearheaded by young Black filmmakers that studied at UCLA. Names like Charles Burnett (Killer Of SheepandTo Sleep With Anger) and Julie Dash (Daughters Of The Dust) are some of the biggest names to come out of that scene, but lesser acknowledged filmmakers like Billy Woodberry were just as important. Thanks to curators likeAshley Clark at the Criterion Channel, Woodberry’s films are now available to stream. LikeKiller Of Sheep,Bless Their Little Heartschronicles the day-to-day life of a group of residents in late ‘70s/early ‘80s Watts, California dealing with everything from depression and infidelity to unemployment and poverty. Not only do both films share the same cast of actors, but they essentially take place in the same cinematic universe. Burnett also served as cinematographer forBless Their Little Hearts.Watch onthe Criterion Channel.‘Sidewalk Stories’Charles Lane’s feature debut is not only commentary on homelessness and drug addiction in post-Reagan-era America, but an homage to silent cinema — it’s a loose remake of Charlie Chaplin’sThe Kid. While films likeJungle FeverandNew Jack Citycertainly touched on drug addiction and poverty in the Black and Latino community in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Lane dove in head first and didn’t sugarcoat anything. Without giving away too much, the final moments of the film are incredibly bleak.Sidewalk Storiesmay be obscure tosome, but it did go on to influence recent films like the academy award winningThe Artist— director Michel Hazanavicius made a point tomention Lane during the press run forThe Artist.Watch it onMaxwith a subscription orYouTube.‘Young Soul Rebels’Isaac Julien’s story of two pirate DJs in 1970s London starts out as a coming of age tale and quickly morphs into a racially charged neo-noir/murder mystery when they come in possession of an audio recording of the murder of their queer friend. Beyond that, the beauty of this film is that it shows the cultural similarities between American Black people and European-based Black people.Watch it on either theCriterion Channelor onApple TVwith a subscription.‘Watermelon Woman’ (1996)Before Cheryl Dunye became the go-to director for prestige Black television (Lovecraft Country, Queen Sugar, The Chi, Dear White People, etc), she was at the forefront of experimental American independent film in the ‘90s. Some of her features are still difficult to find but not her masterwork.Watermelon Womanis the story of an aspiring filmmaker/video store clerk consumed with researching the origins of the “mammy” stereotype. With references and homages to everyone from Melvin Van Peebles to Spike Lee –Watermelon Womanis both a well-crafted movie mixtape and the personal diary of a Black queer movie lover.Watch it on theCriterion Channelwith a subscription or for free via theInternet Archive.‘Mulignans’ (2015)Between the wonderfulNewlyweedsand the Academy Award-winningJudas and The Black Messiah, director Shaka King crafted a string of wonderful short films that deserve just as much attention as his features. What so many filmmakers try to do in two hours, Shaka King manages to do masterfully in under five minutes in this darkly comical race role reversal about gentrification in Brooklyn. While some of the topics in this film are very specific to Brooklyn/New York City, this can be enjoyed and appreciated by anyone with a sense of humor and an understanding of displacement.Watch it onVimeoorYouTube.‘The Inheritance’ (2020)The story of a group of Pan-Africanists in West Philadelphia that set out to make their own isolated community collective away from the rest of the world sounds very niche and specific, but this movie touches on issues like white supremacy, separatism, gun ownership and control, the creation of art, activism, the deconstruction of traditional education, and more — a big part of this film’s identity is connected to the Move bombing that took place in Philadelphia four decades ago. The story ofThe Inheritancemay sound like it was made for a very niche audience within a subgenre of people, but I honestly believe it can be appreciated by anyone. With direct references to everything from the French New Wave toThe Spook Who Sat By The Door, this film is, in my opinion, one of the best and most original works of the decade so far.Watch it onAmazon PrimeorAppleTVwith a subscription.'Personal Problems' (1980)Personal Problemsis the epitome of DIY filmmaking. Instead of waiting for the standard equipment and the right budget, actor/writer/director Bill Gunn grabbed a secondhand digital video camera and just made a film. He didn’t let a lack of resources stop him from creating. While there is a plot to this epic three-hour family drama (the two-act film centers on a Black family living in Harlem burdened by the unexpected arrival of their dysfunctional extended family),Personal Problemsis really about the banalities and authentic qualities that you don’t always see in most modern films about Black Americans. The audio is far from perfect, some of the dialogue is improvised, and the visuals are quite grainy, but that just adds to the film’s textured charm.Watch it onThe Black Film Archiveand purchase it on Blu-Ray viaKino Lorber.\n\nWe know Tubi has a reputation for questionable original programming that can appear to be cheap and exploitative, but if you dig pastTrap House(2023) andRed Flags(2022), you’ll find hundreds of classic and forgotten filmswaiting to be discovered.Murder In Harlemis one of them.

        "description": "For years,Alencia Johnsonwas the definition of \"booked and busy.\" A political strategist and activist, she built a career working with major campaigns, includingElizabeth Warren’spresidential run. But at the height of her success, she found herself questioning whether the grind was worth the cost.\n“The more I was catching flights, the further away from my own dreams I was running,” she recalls. “I started getting tired of hearing friends and family and loved ones saying, ‘Well, we know you're busy. We know you may not be able to make it.’ I'm like, ‘I actually don't want to be that girl.’”Like many, Johnson’s perspective shifted during the pandemic. She realized that her constant hustle wasn’t just exhausting — it was damaging. From persistent health issues to repeating unhealthy relationship patterns, the signs were there, but she had ignored them in favor of professional ambition.Black women, in particular, are conditioned to equate worthiness with productivity. “Our ancestors were literally brought here to either be labor or give birth to labor,” Johnson says. “That is a hard system in society to fight back against. I share that because the onus is not fully on us to get out of this.”Her book doesn’t just critique the system; it offers a roadmap for change. Johnson challenges the idea that success requires self-sacrifice. Instead, she argues that true power comes fromprioritizing joy, restand meaningful relationships. “I lost an Alencia who was limping through the world, showing up to other people's expectations,” she says. “And I gained an Alencia who is literally at her divine purpose that has deeper friendships and relationships, that has a better relationship with her finances, that has a better relationship with her body, that has a better relationship overall with the things that matter.”For Black women who feel trapped by the relentless pursuit of success, Johnson encourages them to form a healthier relationship with guilt. \"I want Black women to start to feel comfortable with feeling the guilt of saying no to certain situations. When I feel guilty, I'm like, 'Well, I'm human. I have emotions. That's actually a good thing that I feel guilty about this.'\"\n“The more I was catching flights, the further away from my own dreams I was running,” she recalls. “I started getting tired of hearing friends and family and loved ones saying, ‘Well, we know you're busy.

        "title": "‘Never Too Much’ Can’t Silence Luther’s Queerness",
        "description": "Just over the halfway point in CNN’s biography ofLuther Vandross,Luther: Never Too Much, friend and writing partnerRichard Marxshares his disappointment with “people who have talked about his personal life, people who he considers friends,” disclosed aspects of his sexuality and its repression with the media. What follows is a quick flash to a photo of Luther performing and a cut to an infamous 2017 interview withPatti LaBelleonWhat’s Happening Live With Andy Cohen, where the legend devotedly discusses their private conversations, confessing that he didn’t want to come out because it’d probably upset his mother. It’s a nasty bit of editing especially because of LaBelle’s craterous absence from the rest of the work. It’s a moment within a relatively toothless projection of who Luther was that threatened to break a viewer’s suspension of disbelief and unlock a sense of same ol’, same ol’ frustration when it comes to tamping down the late artist’s queerness for the sake of… well…I’m not sure exactly.\nPromotional image for 'Luther: Never Too Much.'Modern celebrity documentaries involving the participation of celebrities or their estates is, as prolific filmmaker Ezra EdelmantoldPablo Torre last year, “bordering on branded content.” For Luther’s estate, whosold off stakes to his likeness and some of his music catalog to Primary Wave for $40 million in 2021, the tradeoff here is straightforward: In exchange for the rights to use his music, the family would have some level of creative control in its production. IfNever Too Muchleads to a boost in streams or newer fans purchasing music, that’s just more cash flow. So it bears the question, what kind of documentary do viewers want to see; one that is considered “branded content” with Luther’s hit records and concert footage interspersed; or one with very little music but told with a more holistic perspective? It’s an unfair circumstance made more aggravating by Luther’s caginess about his private romantic life. But that doesn’t mean that his silence wasn’t, itself, a kind ofqueeringthat, rather perceptively, was detangled fromjustsexual attraction.Queerness goes beyond sexuality, it’s a mishmash of political and ideological modalities. The seminal work of queer theoristEve Sedgwick,Tendencies,uncovers what queerness represents. She chronicles the word “queer” from its Indo-European meaning,across, to its Latin meaningtorquere, “to twist;” but she finds that queerness is an entanglement of “loose ends where representation, identity, gender, sexuality and the body can’t be made to line up neatly together.” Citing Sedgwick in his workQueer Figurations in the Media: Critical Reflections on the Michael Jackson Sex Scandal,John Nguyet Ernidefines queer sexuality as “a practice of discursive excess that twists normal notions of gender and sexuality.” Queer identity, specifically, “has to do with the relation across unfixing and unfixable political and social positionings against ‘heteronormativity.’” The depth of these labels isn’t just about determining if one is gay, straight, bi, or pan, but “the refus[al] to operate in the paradigm of categorization.” Luther’s silence could be read as a method of his queerness within the public eye rather than some kind of internalized hatred over who he is or whom he loves. He won’t tell you his sexuality because he’s resisting categorization either way. This is not a closet, it’s an unsent invite to a romantic space that Luther is in no rush to send out.On a musical level, it’s impossible to remove queerness from Luther’s equation completely. Luther wasn’t moved by steamy priapism performed by Black male acts likeTeddy Pendergrass,Otis Redding, or that Purple Virtuosic Muhfucka from Minnesota. He reminisced on falling in love with Dionne’s tonal control, Dianna’s youthful coos, and Aretha’s range and power in a 1985 issue ofJet Magazine. “I acknowledged whatStevie Wonder,Donny Hathaway,Tony Bennettand all the fabulous male singers did,” he told Jet, “but that’s not what aroused my artistic libido.” Luther’s performative softness and effortless sentimentality was a vast departure from the funk-soul froth of his contemporaries. That singularity, in addition to his lyricism, performance and declarative loneliness contributed to the questioning of his sexual preferences.Both in songwriting and in speech Luther was tactful. His wedding fodder hit, “Here and Now,” lacks pronouns, as does any allusions to past lovers going back to his very first crush on a schoolteacher. As an artist covering his favorite songstresses, Luther notably sang all masculine pronouns in his versions. There’s the coyness of his record “Religion” where he begins,“Little Billy likes his best friend Jack / How in the world could he be like that / Mama and Henry wanna have a chat / Boy you need religion.”The line on Luther was that his music was made for lovemaking. And though positioned as a more normative, romantically monogamous singer, his vagueness opens up his music for lovers of all kinds to get their freak on.Luther was as meticulous in his presentation as he was in his music. Everything was on purpose. As‘Never Too Much’gushes on about his chops as a fashion head, home decorator, and stage director. But perhaps most personal for Luther was the home. He says that if he hadn’t become a singer, he’d have been an interior designer. The opulence of his home is another gesture towards queerness just beneath the surface.Jason King, Dean of Cultural and Media Studies at USC, argues in his 2000 piece,Any Love: Silence, Theft and Rumor in the Work of Luther Vandrosson Luther’s reconstruction ofDionne Warwick’s“House is Not a Home”, that the Lutherian version’s “mix of historical fact and imaginative speculation” deems him as “not merely a musical artist but an archivist.” And in the context of this reconstruction dovetails quite nicely with his actual life. While Luther might call “Any Love” his only truly autobiographical record, “House is Not a Home,” still remains one of his most personal. Both in the symbolic and the actual, “Vandross’s problems”-- his love of food, loneliness, and desire for romance– “tend to be wholly circulating under the aegis of domestic space.” Within a heteronormative context, this presents a swath of contradictions that even the documentary couldn’t shield our eyes and ears from if we just dug one layer deeper. In the foyer of that opulent, highly publicized $8.5 million home that hadOprahgawking during an interview, sits an original painting byDavid Hockneywith an image of two men in a shower which displays, well, two men in a shower. Everything is on purpose.So what does it mean that the film operates, in this silence? And why exactly do we as a queer community feel so pricked by the omissions? The answer lies in the defiance. It felt meaningful that LaBelle was absent – her teamtoldPage Sixthat she did sit for an hour-long interview but refused to sign a release because of the production team’s unwillingness to allow her to see the final cut – especially as Luther was LaBelle’s biggest supporter before anyone outside of New York even really knew who she was. He created the first Patti LaBelle fan club after cajoling his friends to join. She was right there singing at his funeral. If the filmmakers were committed to such silence, why bring it up at all?I suppose, for better or worse, the argument would be that Luther’s bellyaching over his sexuality, his code of silence, was honored here. That might not feel totally fulfilling. However, with the understanding thatNever Too Muchisn’t a historical document of his life from a neutral perspective, perhaps, looking toward a heteronormative canon to properly tell our stories in ways that feel sufficient is a fool's errand regardless. Knowing how Luther’s own silence functioned as a method to avoid further intrusions in his private life, which in itself, is an act of queering especially as celebrities began to evolve parasocial relationships structures we see today, Luther is tasking us with something different. We as queer viewers and listeners have to seek those complicated heteronormative refusals elsewhere. Those who know Luther,knewLuther in ways that we never will. And fortunately, not even a documentary made in his name will get us any closer.\nPromotional image for 'Luther: Never Too Much.'\nModern celebrity documentaries involving the participation of celebrities or their estates is, as prolific filmmaker Ezra EdelmantoldPablo Torre last year, “bordering on branded content.” For Luther’s estate, whosold off stakes to his likeness and some of his music catalog to Primary Wave for $40 million in 2021, the tradeoff here is straightforward: In exchange for the rights to use his music, the family would have some level of creative control in its production.

It is famous for its rural beauty and it is home to the village of Street, where the story of Clarks begins,” Bey says. “The Clark family’s loyalty to Street, along with the dedication to their Quaker principles, saw them bring education, opportunity and a unique perspective that would empower this remote village to think creatively, and bring Somerset to the world.”Among the talent that make on-camera appearances in the doc, there’s Wu-Tang Clan rappers Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, who talk about the music video for Killah’s “Apollo Kids,” which prominently featured Clarks.Last month, Beyshared a teaseof hisForensicsalbum with Alchemist in a video posted on his Instagram account.

        "title": "The 30 Most Iconic Black Characters in Video Game History",
        "description": "The first Black video game characters were more stereotypes than … well, characters.Street Fighter II’s Dee Jay was probably seen as a course correction, but he might as well have been called Jammin’ Jayson the Hip-Hop Kickboxer. In the 1987 Commodore 64 game,Street Beat, writers called Rockin Rodney’s stereo — get this — a “ghetto blaster.”\nThe history of Black characters in video games has been undeniably murky, and even attempts at diversity in the 2000s and 2010s were suffocatingly clumsy– i.e. the sexualization of Sheva inResident Evil. Stranded between white-centered games, Black video game characters were often rendered as tokens — parts of thoughtless diversity quotas to be marked off a haphazardly created checklist for a corporate bigwig to simply look like they tried. But through time, sincere innovation and, frankly, more Blackness in the gamer world, Black video game characters have grown to become genuinely indelible parts of American culture.\nToday, to celebrate Black History Month in the best way OkayPlayerGo can, we take a look at the 30 most iconic Black characters in video game history. Without further ado, let’s go.\nLee Everett — 'The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series'Photo by Telltale Games.As a former college professor turned killer turned zombie resistance leader, Lee Everett is the everyman emotional center for one of the more culturally important games ever.Complexand endearing in his devotion to Clementine, Lee had one of the strongest emotional arcs in theWalking Deadseries, and in doing so, presented a fully realized portrait of a human being — capable of disaster, redemption and undeniable heroism.Capt. Kimble \"Irish\" Graves — ‘Battlefield 4’Photo by EA.A standout in a game known for its sweeping storytelling and engaging gameplay, Irish is outspoken and his own kind of noble — memorable from his introduction. Fittingly,The Wirealum Michael K. Williams brings grizzled soul to the character; his gruff vocal tone imbues him with world-weary determination. Irish’sBattlefield 2042comeback served as a fitting send-off for the late actor.Carl \"CJ\" Johnson — ‘Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas’Photo by Rockstar Games.The protagonist ofGTA: San Andreas, CJ has a compelling backstory and is richly drawn in the storytelling so he never feels like a caricature. Voiced by rapper Young Maylay, he’s one of the most popular and recognizable characters in the series; and his iconic line, “Here we go again,” becoming a hall of fame meme has made him an icon for a whole new generation.Alyx Vance — ‘Half Life 2’Photo by Valve.The daughter of formerBlack MesascientistEli VanceandAzian Vance, Alyx, via her close relationship to her dad Eli and bond with initial protagonist Gordon Freeman, is one of the most weighty characters in theHalf Lifeseries. For many she represents the more evolved presentation of female characters of color in contemporary gaming; she’s scrappy and smart, not a hypersexualized vixen; and she’s a survivor, not a damsel in distress.Miles Morales — ‘Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales’Photo by Sony.After co-starring alongside Peter Parker, Miles Morales really came to the fore in this 2020 classic. Proving that he could thrive outside of the shadow of an icon, Morales’ own story was immersively engaging and gamers got to experience his growing pains as an inexperienced Spidey. As the face of his own title, Morales proved he had the sincerity, heart and heroism to make him an instant fan favorite.Adam Hunter — ‘Streets of Rage IV’Photo by Dotemu.A police officer with a code, Adam Hunter was one of the 1990s characters who helped set a new standard for Black portrayals in gaming. His family matters to him — namely his brother Eddie “Skate” Hunter and his daughter Cherry — and his ethics are a huge part of why he’s embraced by so many.Jax — ‘Mortal Kombat II’Photo by Midway Games.It doesn’t get more classic than Jackson “Jax” Briggs. He stood out at a time when Black characters were often crude stereotypes; one of the more prominent Black game characters of the 1990s — who felt somewhat grounded and less like a hackneyed distortion or caricature. Eventually gaining his famous bionic arms inMK3, he would become a fixture in the MK franchise. Jax helped set the table for more fully developed Black characters in gaming.Clementine — ‘Walking Dead’​​Photo by Telltale Games.​The emotional counterpoint to Lee Everett and the heart and soul ofWalking Dead.Clementine is a beloved character whose story arc has captured fans’ attention since she was introduced, and her growth is some ofThe Walking Dead’smost engrossing.Sgt. Avery Johnson — ‘Halo’Photo by Halo Studios.A UNSC Marine who served as something of a constant throughout the originalHalotrilogy; Sgt. Johnson is a fan favorite. Energetic and sarcastic, Johnson often cracked jokes and lobbed insults at the expense of the Covenant and playfully with fellow soldiers and Chief. He delivered some of the most iconic lines in the original games, including his masterful speech inHalo 2that began with “Dear Humanity…”Balrog — ‘Street Fighter II’Photo by Capcom.With a character design originally meant to evoke Mike Tyson, Balrog quickly became one of the most iconic Black characters in gaming.

Fittingly,The Wirealum Michael K. Williams brings grizzled soul to the character; his gruff vocal tone imbues him with world-weary determination. Irish’sBattlefield 2042comeback served as a fitting send-off for the late actor.\nPhoto by Rockstar Games.\nThe protagonist ofGTA: San Andreas, CJ has a compelling backstory and is richly drawn in the storytelling so he never feels like a caricature.

He stood out at a time when Black characters were often crude stereotypes; one of the more prominent Black game characters of the 1990s — who felt somewhat grounded and less like a hackneyed distortion or caricature. Eventually gaining his famous bionic arms inMK3, he would become a fixture in the MK franchise. Jax helped set the table for more fully developed Black characters in gaming.\n​​Photo by Telltale Games.​\nThe emotional counterpoint to Lee Everett and the heart and soul ofWalking Dead.Clementine is a beloved character whose story arc has captured fans’ attention since she was introduced, and her growth is some ofThe Walking Dead’smost engrossing.\nPhoto by Halo Studios.\nA UNSC Marine who served as something of a constant throughout the originalHalotrilogy; Sgt. Johnson is a fan favorite. Energetic and sarcastic, Johnson often cracked jokes and lobbed insults at the expense of the Covenant and playfully with fellow soldiers and Chief. He delivered some of the most iconic lines in the original games, including his masterful speech inHalo 2that began with “Dear Humanity…”\nPhoto by Capcom.\nWith a character design originally meant to evoke Mike Tyson, Balrog quickly became one of the most iconic Black characters in gaming. In the early ’90s, the popularity of theStreet Fighter IIwas staggering and over the years, Balrog becoming a constant for the franchise turned him into one of the most recognizable characters in video games.

        "description": "Like the truth itself, the 56th annual NAACP Image Awards are set to arrive at the moment we need it most. On Feb. 22 at 8 p.m. EST, BET and CBS will stream the awards show to spotlight the dreamers, storytellers, athletes — the leaders — who define Blackness in the worlds of entertainment and beyond. In a climate that increasingly looks to silence Black voices, watch live as NAACP recognizes these champions of culture therightway. After all, if we don’t celebrate ourselves, who will?\nFILM/TVFor its list of TV and film nominees, the NAACP explored the talents of both established legends and rising voices in the industry. Showcasing quiet grace and steady intensity, Colman Domingo earned two nominations for his roles as a wrongfully convicted prisoner turned thespian (Sing Sing) and a fugitive journalist (The Madness). Meanwhile, Denzel Washington’sGladiator IIturn as an icily calculating arms dealer earned him a nom for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, and Cynthia Erivo’s role as an emerging Wicked Witch of the West (Wicked) translated to nominations for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and Entertainer of the Year. Also racking up the noms were multi-threat talents like Ayo Edebiri (The Bear,Inside Out 2,Saturday Night Live), Regina King (Shirley), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Damon Wayans Jr. (Poppa’s House) and more. As diverse as it is dynamic, the list of nominees is an impressive look at the present and future.See on InstagramRECORDING ARTISTSPulling from eclectic rappers and genre-fusing vocalists, this year’s list of recording artist nominees is no less kaleidoscopic.

Following a dominant 2024 filled with No. 1 singles and iconic bars, Kendrick snagged a nod for Outstanding Male Artist, where he’ll compete with Usher, Chris Brown and more. Riding the momentum she created with her acclaimedCowboy Carteralbum, Beyoncé was nominated for the Outstanding Female Artist trophy alongside Coco Jones, Doechii and the irrepressible GloRilla, each contributing to the colorful tapestry of modern Black sound.Scott Mills, the President and CEO of BET Media Group offered the following about the upcoming award show: “BET is proud to continue its longstanding partnership with the NAACP to celebrate Black excellence in all forms.

A born-and-raised New Yorker and first-gen Caribbean-American, Gab’s perfect day moves between quiet corners and spontaneous hangs, with stops for book-browsing, plant-based eats, and grown-folks fun. In this week’s How to Be Outside, Inside, she gives us a look at the slower, softer side of her city life.\nOkayplayer: Where do you go in NYC when you want to be outside without being outside? (AKA, what do you do in NYC when you want to have a good time, but also want to be in a quiet environment?)DJ GabSoul:Aside from a quiet coffee shop by my house where I like to read in the corner, I'd likely go check out a museum or exhibit. Or,Brooklyn Public Libraryto check out another book before finishing the one I'm already reading. Double points if they have an exhibit on display. If I'm in the mood to splurge, I'll probably check out some local shops likeAmani Market, and if I have ample time, record digging. Anywhere I can read, listen to my own music, and stimulate myself while everyone around me minds their business.Where do you go in NYC when you want to be around people but not with people?I like to pop intoAunts et Unclesbecause there's a chance I'll run into someone I know there or in the area. I also like to work fromThe Corner Storeon Nostrand because it feels less coffee-shoppy. I also like to stroll around the neighborhood and go where the wind takes me, like my fave ice cream shops (Mr. P'sorIsland Pops). Where I really need to be strolling to is the gym; it's been some time since I've consistently worked out — God help me — but I would also go to a fitness class like pilates or boxing.What would your perfect day in NYC look like?The weather has to be just to my liking, not disgustingly hot but warm enough that I can be outside without a jacket, and I don't have anything pressing on my to-do list, so I can move at a chill pace. I'd grab a matcha for the road from a local coffee shop (ideally Black-owned, likeLovelane) and take a walk down Eastern Parkway to Prospect Park to find a quiet spot by the water to lay out by and read a book, journal, people watch and reflect in nature before heading back to the chaotic concrete jungle beyond the gates.When I feel the sun starting to set, I'd grab some early dinner on the way home. Then, if I'm not DJing that night, I'd go out to check my DJ friends' sets — especially if it's at a lounge or more intimate spot — and/or link up with some friends for some spontaneous grown people fun because I rarely get the chance to. And ideally, I'll be back in my house before 2 a.m.! As someone who travels a lot for work and performs for a living, I'm usually in an overstimulating atmosphere, so I really enjoy when I can just kick it and be a normal person.\nOkayplayer: Where do you go in NYC when you want to be outside without being outside?

It’s not off the main strip so crowd-wise, it’s lowkey, and if I’m lucky, she might have some leftovers for me.\nWhat does your perfect NYC day look like, from morning to night?\nMy perfect day in NYC starts with a run in the morning or pilates atThe Fit In. The Fit In is a Black woman-owned fitness studio in Brooklyn with incredible instructors that I’ve been going to for years.\nFor breakfast or brunch, I stop byLittle Eggfor their pancakes, then take away to Fort Greene Park to see what vendors are set up and bump into friends along the way.\nA pre-dinner glass of wine and snack atPrima– it might be the only natural wine bar in NYC with a Jamaican beef patty on the menu.\nIn the evening, catching a vinyl set atDamballa, then making dinner at home with my spouse.",

        "description": "Editor's Note: The content on this page is sponsored by Spearhead Spirits.\nFrom Africa to the world.\nAtOkayplayer, we’re always excited whenever we get the opportunity to highlight the fearless minds and innovative individuals pushing the culture forward. That’s exactly whatDamola TimeyinandChris Frederickhave done with their premium liquor brand,Spearhead Spirits.\nThis summer, Spearhead is bringing its unique flavor to NYC with a series of vibe-y gatherings at the Darling Rooftop atop midtown’s Park Lane Hotel. The soirees will feature a rotating selection of DJs spinning Afro House, Afrobeats, and amapiano tracks — the first of these goes down onJune 10 from 7 p.m. till late,featuring sounds byDJ Tunez—RSVP here.Okayplayercaught up with Spearhead Spirits co-founder, Damola, to find out more about Spearhead Spirits’ summer series and what’s coming up next for the brand.Okayplayer:What’s the origin story of Spearhead Spirits and what’s your ultimate goal for the brand?Damola:Spearhead Spirits is the premium African spirits company with the ambition of putting Africa on the world’s bar. Back in 2019, we realised that wherever we went, particularly outside of Africa, we saw spirits representing other regions, apart from our own continent. And then in Africa we were importing brands from other parts of the world rather than drinking products made at home. So we decided to change that, by creating vodka, gin, agave and whisky, made in Africa, using African ingredients, by Africans, for the world to enjoy.What are your signature offerings and can you describe the African connections and ingredients in each of them?We have created four brands in different spirits categories, Bayab Gin, Vusa Vodka, Sango Agave and Mansas Whisky, that all have African ingredients and provenance at their core. Bayab’s hero botanical is the baobab fruit from the famous African baobab tree, sourced from Ghana. Did you know that agave, the plant used to make tequila, also grows in Africa? We use that plant that grows in South Africa to create Sango Agave, we use local sugarcane to produce our vodka, and in our whisky, we have the incredible African grain, sorghum which makes our whisky truly African. We produce all of our products in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.How important is it for your brand to authentically speak to African Culture, and how does this residency at Park Lane Hotel in NYC speak to that?It’s critical. We’ve built our brands to celebrate Africa in a way that’s modern, premium, and true to the continent’s creativity and culture, not a cliché version of it. This residency at Park Lane Hotel gives us a platform to bring African spirits, flavors, and culture into one of the world’s most iconic cities and share our vibrancy in the places where our culture belongs. It’s about showing that African brands can lead on any stage, with authenticity and style.What can attendees expect from these Spearhead gatherings going down at Darling Rooftop this summer?Expect amazing energy. The vibes. Afrobeats, Afro House, amapiano, the best of our music today, and our cocktails too. We’re bringing modern African cocktail culture to the best rooftop in New York, with the best view of the city. The skyline hits different from up here, you’ll see. And yes, there might just be a few surprises in store for those who join us.Finally, what’s up next for Spearhead this year? Any other major activations, launches or experiences we can look out for?We’ve got a big year ahead. Our brands are already well-loved across Africa. You’ll find people enjoying them in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, and we’re continuing to grow globally. Look out for Bayab Gin in the U.S. this summer, especially our African palm and pineapple flavor, which is about to be everywhere, and our orange and marula flavor that’s perfect for negroni season this fall. Sango African Agave is also making waves as the new alternative to tequila. At the same time, we’re working with some incredible bartenders and mixologists across the continent to keep pushing African cocktail culture forward, both at home and internationally. And we’re always open to collaboration. If you’re a brand or creative doing your own thing and looking for an African spirits partner, get in touch.

        "title": "Cloudy with a Chance of Progress: How Cloudy Donut is Flipping Gentrification on Its Head",
        "description": "WhenZewiditu JewelandDerrick Faulconopened Cloudy Donut Co. inBrooklynHeights in 2022, they weren’t just selling sweets, they were shifting the cultural landscape. “We became the first Black-owned food and beverage business in the neighborhood,” Ruffin says. “A Black woman who’d been living in the neighborhood, she’s in her sixties, asked us if we worked for the company. And when she learned that we were the proprietors, she was completely shocked. She said, ‘In all the years of me living here, I’d never seen a Black-owned business in this neighborhood.’”\nThat moment sparked deeper research into the neighborhood’s history. Ruffin learned Brooklyn Heights is considered America’s first suburb. “Once I learned that and I did the history,  I coined the term ‘reverse gentrification,’ which is not the dictionary’s version [but instead to mean] to bring our Black-owned businesses into affluent communities [that are] absent of color.” She explained their version of reverse gentrification to mean bringing Blackness into white spaces, loud, proud and customer-facing.\nPhoto courtesy of Cloudy Donut.But what does it take to stay in those spaces? According to Faulcon, it’s more than visibility. It’s about showing up. And spending. “Black businesses don’t only need support, we need consumption,” he says. He emphasizes the difference between casual support and real commitment: regularly buying the product, spreading the word, and even offering your skills when you can. He believes that Black professionals, especially those working in white-led corporate spaces, should consider investing time and expertise in Black-owned ventures. Not for the clout, but for collective progress.That idea is central to their Seven Streams Strategy, a broader vision that encourages people to have multiple streams of income. For Faulcon and Ruffin, one of those streams is The Brown Collective, a creative platform designed to uplift other businesses and creators of color. “It’s been really beautiful,” Ruffin says. “Seven Streams is all about focusing our intent on the things that we’ve created and really just sharing that education and giving that game.”Despite featuring over 40 vegan flavors in their bakery, Ruffin and Faulcon are unapologetically not vegans. “I wasn't looking for vegan donuts. I was looking for donuts,” says Faulcon. “The white boy who owned the Dallas Cowboys, he never played football. But when Black people own some s**t, like a vegan donut shop, they gotta be vegan.”Photo courtesy of Cloudy Donut.For Faulcon, focusing ondonutswas about simplicity, scalability, and joy. “Products are like ideas. They can open up doors that you otherwise couldn't,” he explains. “Donuts, cupcakes, cookies, ice cream —those particular dessert industries have a high customer retention because they got products that customers fall in love with based off the quality.”Cloudy Donut is a business built on intention — one that sees presence in white spaces not as aspiration, but as strategy. Faulcon and Ruffin aren’t trying to assimilate; they’re reclaiming space in neighborhoods that have historically excluded Black businesses. “We’ve been authentically Black in a predominantly affluent white neighborhood,” Faulcon says.Their goal isn’t just to be present in these spaces. It’s to remain their complete selves while doing it. “We not code-switching, we ain't changing our tone, our energy, or none of that shit,” he affirms. “We've been authentically Black in a predominantly affluent white neighborhood.”So sure, go to Cloudy Donut for the brown butter chocolate chip or the sweet potato cinnamon. But if you really want to support a Black business, follow Faulcon’s advice: “What Black businesses don't need [is for] you to tag 'em. That's cool. But what they really need you to do is work for 'em and work with 'em.”\nPhoto courtesy of Cloudy Donut.\nBut what does it take to stay in those spaces?

        "description": "This week, we’re catching up withNikki Anticss,a DJ, MC, and curator who has become a staple in NYC’s creative scene. Born and raised in Brooklyn with Belizean roots, Nikki’s sound is Caribbean-infused and community-driven, much like the events she curates: safe, intentional spaces where women feel seen. When she’s not behind the decks, Nikki’s recharging at low-key lounges, vibing to good music, or spending the day with her son exploring the borough that raised her.\nWhere do you go in NYC when you want to be outside without being outside?\nSe7en Lounge, I love the ambiance and intimacy in this lounge. Bunton'sWorld Famousalways has good music.Lacey Burgerat Ra Ra Rhino has amazing food, and it's a speakeasy in the back, which I love.Therapy Wine Baris my go-to because I don’t drink hard liquor and love a great wine selection—plus it’s very cute and intimate. AndL Train Vintage, because thrifting always puts me in a better mood mentally. Being born and raised in NYC, thrifting is like going to the supermarket.\nWhere do you go when you want to be around people but not with people?\nBrooklyn Blend. The smoothies, the patties—everything about this space and the mission resonates with me. Plus, it’s Black and family-owned.Santa Panzais my little Italian escape in the neighborhood. AndEl Santoalways makes me feel like I’m experiencing authentic Mexican cuisine with top-tier hospitality.\nWhat does your perfect NYC day look like with your kid?\nA perfect day starts with smoothies from Brooklyn Blend, then heading toSpace Clubin Fort Greene. After that, we hit the grocery store to grab everything we need to make homemade pizza. After pizza, it’s quick playtime, then bath and bed.",

It’s all-you-can-eat lobster, oysters, pizza, omelets, and more. And people don’t really bother you there because SoHo House is members only. But sometimes you might run into old friends, which is cool.See on InstagramWhat would your perfect day in NYC look like?Bike riding with my daughter, getting ice cream, then by our pool at the crib in Brooklyn with friends and family at sundown. I’ve been showing her how to play 8-ball pool in the lounge now that she’s finally tall enough, so that’s exciting. Night time, I’d hit a few spots in the city and hear some good music.

        "title": "Neighborhood Spotlight: September Cafe in Bed-Stuy",
        "description": "I’ve lived in Bed-Stuy since 2008, and like so many in my community — and especially the natives who were born and raised here — it’s been bittersweet to watch the area change. The bitter: a barrage of newcomers who misunderstand the vibe, who excessively call in noise complaints to the police, who clutter the sidewalks with dog leavings, and, of course, the life-threatening rent hikes that plague long-time residents. The sweet: widespread rejuvenation that sparks new opportunities and callsidealistic entrepreneursto open shops and eateries. Over the years, Bed-Stuy has become deliciously walkable with streets peppered by hidden gems.\nOne such gem is September, a quaint Black-owned cafe at the corner of Saratoga Avenue and MacDonough Street. The owner, Sára Lopes, opened the cafe in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. “Like a lot of us during Covid, I lost my job, and an opportunity came up to take over an existing cafe space in my neighborhood,” says Lopes. She was compelled to preserve the space as a cafe to serve the often-overlooked stretch of blocks near the Bed-Stuy/Bushwick border. “Before September, there wasn’t really a place like this where people could come together over coffee, work, or just relax,” Lopes explains. “Our neighborhood has a growing creative community, and I wanted to create a space that reflects that energy — a place where artists, entrepreneurs and everyday people can meet and feel inspired.”\nAmong the slew of changes in the area,cafescan be a touchy subject. As vital third spaces for city-dwellers, they can either add value to the community or feel like a soulless intrusion. But September is a cafe that knows its neighbors. “As the neighborhood evolves, I want the cafe to remain a place that reflects and uplifts the people who call this area home,” says Lopes.Inside the brightly lit coffeehouse, there’s work from local artists hanging on the walls and products from nearby vendors on the shelves. It’s a cafe that makes space for newcomers while remaining true to its roots. “I see the cafe as a bridge between the past, present, and future of this area,” Lopes says. “It’s about ensuring that the culture remains vibrant, inclusive, and rooted in the people who make it special.”\nAmong the slew of changes in the area,cafescan be a touchy subject.

        "description": "Despite being one of the most populated cities in the world, New York can be isolating. According to theU.S. Census Bureau, about 36.5 percent of NYC’s population is foreign-born, and 11.4 percent were born in other U.S. states, meaning many are searching for community.\nOwen Akhibi Herrera understands that firsthand. After moving to New York in March 2023, he found it difficult to form meaningful connections. “I've lived in a number of countries — Spain, Switzerland, the U.K. — and New York City is the hardest city to get used to,” he says.\nSeeking connection, he joined a local church, which transformed his experience. “I thought it would be cool for others to find similar communities.”\nIn July 2024, he launched Peak and Pace Run Club to blendfitness with community. The first run had 12 participants, then quickly grew. “By summer, we had 700 runners.”\nSee on InstagramHerrera believes the club’s growth reflects a deep need for belonging. “Peak and Pace has never been just about running. We get lunch, grab drinks — it’s community first, fitness second.”The club welcomes all experience levels, from walkers to six-minute milers. “Our walking group had 300 people last summer.”While fun and camaraderie are key, Peak and Pace also encourages growth. “We’re here to push ourselves mentally and physically,” Herrera explains.Beyond running, the club hosts ski trips, comedy nights, yoga and karaoke. “We want people to actually connect, not just run and go home.”Looking for new friends, fitness, and fun? Lace up your Nikes and meet Peak and Pace. Come as you are, leave better.\nSee on Instagram\nHerrera believes the club’s growth reflects a deep need for belonging. “Peak and Pace has never been just about running.
